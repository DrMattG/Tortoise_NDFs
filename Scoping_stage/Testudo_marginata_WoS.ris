AB  - The taxonomic status of the Greek Testudo species, marginated tortoise (Testudo marginata Schoepff, 1793) and dwarf marginated tortoise (Testudo weissingeri Bour, 1995), is controversed. In order to study the gene flow among these Greek Testudo species, eight polymorphic microsatellite markers were characterized and screened for 32 individuals. The number of alleles observed per locus ranged from two to 19. Observed heterozygosities varied from 0.235 to 0.830. These microsatellite loci were also successfully tested on seven closely related species of Testudinidae. This set of microsatellites offers an efficient tool to investigate genetic differentiation among testudinid species.

AB  - Blood samples were obtained from the dorsal coccygeal vein and the brachial vein of five adult (four females and one male) and two subadult males of marginated tortoise (Testudo marginata) and hematologic and biochemical parameters were compared. Significant differences were found for red blood cell count, hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, total proteins, uric acid, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, and phosphorus, which were greater in the brachial vein samples. Hemodilution due to lymph was observed when collecting blood from the dorsal coccygeal vein, and it is thought to be the cause of the differences found. This research documented that the brachial vein is a more reliable and consistent venipuncture site than dorsal coccygeal vein in marginated tortoise.

AB  - The authors measured the chemical values of blood parameters in protected European tortoise species (Testudo sp.), Marginated tortoise (Testudo marginata) during breading season. They used 5 males and 5 females in the study and the values are reported in Table 2. The examination focused on the calcium and triglyceride levels which showed significant differences between the two genders. The females produce the follicles and eggshells during this time of the year (May) so the measured levels were physiologically higher.

AB  - We examine the evolutionary relationships of the five traditionally recognized species of the western Palearctic tortoise genus Testudo (T graeca, T hermanni, T horsfieldii, T kleinmanni, and T marginata) and the newly described dwarfed species T weissingeri by using sequence data of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and nuclear genomic fingerprints with inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR). Testudo weissingeri differs from T marginata mainly by its smaller size and some color-pattern characteristics. T weissingeri lives in the driest, poorest and hottest part of the distributional range of T marginata. While both data sets demonstrated phylogenetic distinctness of the five traditionally recognized species of Testudo, some subspecies and even some local populations, we detected no differentiation between T marginata and T weissingeri. We conclude that T weissingeri is not a distinct evolutionary unit. We suggest that its small size is the result of suboptimal environmental conditions with limited resources and synonymize it with T marginata. T marginata and T kleinmanni form a clade that is supported both by our mtDNA and nuclear genomic data sets. According to mtDNA data, this clade is the sister taxon to the T graeca complex. A sister group relationship of T hermanni and ((T marginata + T kleinmanni) + T graeca) is moderately to weakly supported by mtDNA data; T horsfieldii is the sister taxon to a clade comprising all other Testudo species.

AB  - The Isle of Crete contains an important endemic fossil fauna that has been studied extensively in the past. An endemic fossil tortoise, Testudo marginata cretensis Bachmayer, Brinkerink & Symeonidis, 1975, had previously been named from Pleistocene cave deposits in the island, presumably being larger than the mainland species and having some important morphological differences as well. In this paper I revise these type specimens and describe for the first time numerous additional fossil specimens from the Pleistocene sites of Gerani IV, Zourida, Koumpes, Liko, Mavro Mouri IV, and Simonelli Caves (near Herakleion), Rethymnon fissure, and from the open site of Sitia in the eastern part of the Island. These specimens belong mostly to the marginated tortoise, but the presence of a terrapin is confirmed as well. These new fossils help to refute the validity of the Cretan subspecies, and change the range of the marginated tortoise during Pleistocene/Holocene times in the southern Balkans.

AB  - The late Pliocene (early Villafranchian, MN 16a) locality of Milia (Grevena, Greece) has yielded numerous remains of mammals, such as zygodons, mastodons, rhinocerotids, hipparions, bovids, cervids, suids, carnivorans and tapirs. Several specimens of chelonians have also been discovered and comprise a small testudinid, a geoemydid and a giant tortoise. The presence of a giant tortoise and the presence of a geoemydid with large dimensions are further examples of the trend towards gigantism evidenced by the diverse fauna of Milia. In terms of taxonomic abundance of extinct turtles, this is the richest locality in Greece. The small testudinid is of particular importance because it preserves a posteriorly flared carapace, as in the extant Testudo marginata, but the posterior carapace is much taller and anteroposteriorly shorter. These characters allow us to erect a new species, Testudo brevitesta sp. nov., and to discuss the presence of the marginated tortoise and closely related forms in Greece. The new taxon is analysed in a phylogenetic context within other extant and extinct testudinids, providing new information on the clade Testudona.

AB  - Intranuclear coccidiosis of tortoises (TINC) has been described in association with systemic disease in various species of tortoises. TINC has been detected in numerous tortoises from the United States, but there are only a few reports from tropical tortoises in Germany and no reports from Asia. Using a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, samples from 1,011 tortoises were screened for the presence of TINC. Samples originated from animals kept in captivity in Europe and in China. Coccidia were detected in a total of 27 chelonians (2.7%), including the first description of TINC in a marginated tortoise (Testudo marginata), Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni), African spurred tortoise (Centrochelys sulcata), and yellow-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis denticulatus). The highest percentage of positive animals was found in radiated tortoises (Astrochelys radiata). Although the percentage of positive animals was relatively low, this study demonstrates the global distribution of TINC in captive chelonians as well as expanding the known host range for these pathogens.

AB  - The courtship and mounting behaviour of tortoises is elaborate, and based on a multiple signalling system involving visual, olfactory and acoustic signals. Vocalizations related to mounting seem to be particularly significant because tortoises vocalize mainly at this time. Vocalizations and courtship behaviour may be costly for males, and if these costs increase differentially for different males, then the potential exists for vocalizations and displays to reveal male individual quality. In this correlative study, we analysed relationships between male mounting success and morphological and behavioural traits, particularly acoustic signals, exhibited by male marginated tortoises (Testudo marginata) during courtship, in a group of 94 individuals breeding in semi-natural enclosures. For each male, we estimated general body condition, courtship intensity and mounting success; calls of mounting males were recorded and four sonagraphic features were measured. Calls differed significantly among males, and two features varied according to body condition. Male mounting success significantly increased according to the male/female size-ratio, suggesting the existence of a size-based assortative mating. Mounting success was also highly correlated with courtship intensity, measured as number of bites and rams given to females before mounting, and with number of calls emitted during mounting. Finally, mounting success was negatively related to call duration. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which features of tortoise vocalizations are shown to convey reliable information about male quality in socio-sexual contexts.

AB  - Testudo marginata, the largest European land tortoise, is suffering habitat degradation and destruction. Some populations, in markedly degraded habitats, are characterized by divergent morphotypes. However, the evolutionary significance of these morphotypes is of debate. Using 11 polymorphic microsatellites, we studied: (1) marginated tortoises from Sardinia that display a divergent morphotype this population was potentially introduced from Greece; and (2) an area in the southern Peloponnese that includes a small and degraded zone in which marginated tortoises are dwarf. Genetic analyses run without any a priori assignment clearly acknowledge the specimens sampled in the territory of the dwarf form as a single group whilst Sardinian specimens are clustered with other specimens from the northern part of the area sampled in Greece. Demographic analyses suggest that Sardinian tortoises originated recently from some of the populations sampled in the northern part of the area sampled in Greece. Over locations sampled in Greece, a landscape-genetic analysis allowed us to detect potential landscape features that may reduce gene flow between the dwarf form territory and surrounding areas. Our results suggest that the territory of the dwarf form is particularly propitious for marginated tortoises and that conservation regulations in Greece should be reinforced to protect this area from increasing impact of human activities changing from traditional agriculture to mechanization and extensive use of chemicals.

AB  - Six young tortoises Testudo marginala Schoepff, 1792 were experimentally infected with Hemolivia inalfritallica (Sergent et Sergent, 1904). The prepatent period ranged from 6 to 8 weeks. Young, smaller, club-like forms (6-9 x 3-6 mu m) of gametocytes appeared in the peripheral blood first, whereas mature, elongated, cylindrical forms (9-12 x 5-7 mu m) were detected after 1-2 weeks and predominated during later patency. Three of the infected tortoises were euthanized and dissected to study the endogenous stages. Meronts occurred in the cells of the reticulo-endothelial system and in the erythrocytes; these were observed mostly in parenchymatous organs. Mature forms measured 14.2 x 9.3 mu m and contained 7-12 merozoites. Cysts with two (exceptionally one) cystozoites were also found predominantly in parenchymatous organs and measured 14.8 x 7.9 mu m. Pathological changes attributable to Heniolivia were mild and limited to liver and kidneys. The role of individual developmental stages of haemogregarines is discussed with respect to evolution of heteroxenous life cycle and long-term persistence of parasites in their intermediate hosts.

AB  - Cryptosporidiosis affects the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract of humans as well as of a wide range of companion, farm, laboratory and wild animals. In the past few years, three independent studies have provided strong evidence for the existence of a distinct Cryptosporidium species affecting tortoises and likely circulating in other reptile species as well. A new Cryptosporidium genotype was firstly detected and genetically characterized in a marginated tortoise in Italy in 2007 and named Cryptosporidium sp. ex Testudo marginata CrIT-20. The phylogenetic analysis of this isolate indicated that this Cryptosporidium was unique and belonged to the intestinal clade. These findings were later on confirmed by the detection of genetic homologies of isolates from a python and a chameleon from Spain and by recent research in the United States. The latter study presented both the occurrence of intestinal lesions in a pancake tortoise and a Russian tortoise and the genetic characterization of the isolates, together with the first pictures of the endogenous stages of Cryptosporidium CrIT-20. Phylogenetic inference based on the sequences representing small subunit of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (SSU) of these isolates confirmed the pathological findings because this Cryptosporidium was related to the intestinal group and supported previous results in T. marginata from Italy. The present scientific data on the Cryptosporidium CrIT-20 support its classification as a new species of Cryptosporidium causing intestinal diseases in tortoises. Although further morphological (i.e. exogenous stages) and biological aspects (i.e. complete host range) are yet to be elucidated, it is proposed that this Cryptosporidium is designated Cryptosporidium ducismarci.

AB  - Objecitive: Establishment of 20 blood reference values of terrestrial tortoises kept in Germany and comparison of the parameters of four different species of mediterranean tortoises. Material and methods: Blood samples were taken from the dorsal coccygeal vein of 61 clinically normal terrestrial tortoises kept in Germany, and 20 hematological and biochemical parameters were analyzed. All animals tested had been raised in or were part of one of five selected tortoise collections for at least three years. All of them were housed outdoors from spring to fall and underwent hibernation regularly. Their diet consisted of exclusively herbivore nourishment. All 61 terrestrial tortoises belonged to the following species: Testudo marginata (marginated tortoise, n = 16), Testudo graeca (spur-thighed tortoise, n 15), Testudo hermanni (Hermann's tortoise, n = 22) and Testudo horsfieldi (Russian tortoise, n = 8). Results: Median, minimum and maximum values and p-values were determined for the following parameters: packed cell volume (PCV), alanin aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), alkaline phosphatase (AP), creatine kinase (CK) uric acid, urea nitrogen (BUN), cholesterol, glucose, fructosamine, total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, cholinesterase (CHE), sodium, potassium, total calcium, ionized calcium and inorganic phosphorus. Conclusions and clinical relevance: Statistically significant differences between tortoise species were detected for 10 out of 20 parameters. The obtained results lead to the conclusion that species differentiation within the group of "mediterranean tortoises" is very important when interpreting blood parameters.

AB  - This paper reports information about the presence of three allochthonous reptiles species in Calabria: Testudo marginata, Trachemys scripta elegans and Chamaeleo chamaeleon. The first one was found in three sites located in the Catena Costiera Massif and in the Crati Valley (Northern Calabria). The slider turtle was found in seven different sites throughout all the region. It massively colonised the Angitola artificial lake: here, this turtle lives in natural conditions and its reproduction was confirmed by the presence of nests, eggs and hatchlings. C. chamaeleon is present in sandy coastal habitats near Palmi and Gioia Tauro (Southern Calabria). From a conservationistic point of view, serious damages to autochtonous species could be caused by the spreading of T scripta elegans: this species has already determined the local extinction of Angitola's Emys orbicularis populations.

AB  - Blood smears from wild-caught, long-term captive tortoises, Testudo marginata, revealed the presence of gametocytes of a Hemolivia mauritanica-like hemogregarine in the erythrocytes of 72% tortoises examined. Significant parasitemia was also found in animals living several years in captivity. Experimentally infected tortoises showed no evidence of a decrease in parasitemia level more than 15 mo after infection. Morphologically, stages found in tortoises' erythrocytes were indistinguishable from those referred to by previous workers as H. mauritanica from Testudo graeca. Moreover, successful experimental transmission to Hyalomma aegyptium confirms the conspecificity with H. mauritanica. The occurrence of H. mauritanica gametocytes in tortoise living up to 8 yr in captivity is suggested to result from continuous, long-lasting cyclic merogony in tortoises' parenchymatous organs, which is an unknown phenomenon in the life cycle of Hemolivia spp.

AB  - Free-living and captive chelonians might suffer from upper respiratory tract disease (URTD), a pathology primarily caused by Mycoplasma agassizii. Wild tortoises can also be an important reservoir of Salmonella spp., which are commensal in the host reptile but are potential zoonotic agents. Between July 2009 and June 2010, we screened free-living European tortoises (spur-thighed tortoises Testudo graeca, Hermann's tortoises Testudo hermanni, marginated tortoises Testudo marginata) temporarily housed in a wildlife center in Italy. We molecularly characterized 13 Mycoplasma isolates detected in all Testudo spp. studied, and three PCR-positive animals showed typical URTD clinical signs at the time of sampling. Three Salmonella enterica serotypes (Abony, Potsdam, Granlo), already related to reptile-associated human infections, were also identified. These results highlight the potential role played by wildlife recovery centers in the spread and transmission of pathogens among wild chelonians and to humans.

AB  - Cryptosporidiosis is a disease caused by apicomplexan parasites of the genus Cryptosporidium, which affect the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals worldwide. In the present study, Cryptosporidium isolates from captive European tortoises (Testudo graeca, Testudo hermanni and Testudo marginata) in Italy were genetically characterised using gene/s encoding Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) and/or the hypervariable segment internal to the SSU rDNA. Six isolates from T. graeca, T. hermanni and T. marginata revealed 100% sequence identity with the zoonotic Cryptosporidium pestis (Cryptosporidium parvum 'bovine genotype'), while a sequence from one T. marginata was a unique uncharacterised genotype (Cryptosporidium sp. ex T. marginata). The new genotype is phylogenetically characterised as belonging to the intestinal cryptosporidial lineage. The present study indicates that tortoises may disseminate Cryptosporidium oocysts in the captive environment. The identification of the zoonotic genotype in the faeces of captive European tortoises indicates a potential risk for humans within the household. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tortoises of the genus Testudo living in Italy are Testudo hermanni, Testudo graeca and Testudo marginata. Although a great deal of information has been acquired on the internal medicine and surgery on these animals, little is known of their parasitological fauna. A survey on the presence of gastro-intestinal parasitic nematodes in tortoises bred in Italy was carried out to acquire extensive epidemiological data. Stool samples of 62 tortoises (37 T. hermanni hermanni, 13 T. graeca, 6 T. hermanni boettgeri and 6 T. marginata) were macroscopically examined and subjected to qualitative (flotation and Baermann techniques) and quantitative (McMaster technique) microscopic examinations. Adult nematodes were identified using morphological keys. Eggs of oxyurids (species indistinguishable) and adults of Alaeuris numidica, Mehdiella microstoma, Mehdiella uncinata, Tachygonetria longicollis, Tachygonetria conica and Tachygonetria palearcticus (Oxyurida, Pharyngodonidae); larvae and adults of Atractis dactyluris (Ascaridida, Atractidae); and eggs and adults of Angusticaecum holopterum (Ascaridida, Ascarididae) were identified in all animals >1 year, whereas all tortoises <1 year of age were parasite-free. Moreover, this study reports for the first time A. numidica and M. microstoma in T. marginata. This work shows that nematodes affecting tortoises are diffused in Italy and highlights the need to investigate their epidemiology more in depth.

AB  - The plasma concentration of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol was measured in 13 adult Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni), seven adult spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) and two adult marginated tortoises (Testudo marginata) during 2004. They were healthy, of both sexes, and kept in captivity under natural unfiltered sunlight in southern England with no dietary sources of cholecalciferol. Blood samples were taken in March, June and August, and the concentration of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol did not vary significantly with the seasons. However, the concentrations in the female tortoises were always significantly lower than in the males.

We present ultimate and intermediate hosts of Apicomplexa, including man, as well as vectors transmitting these unicellular Protista. We describe symptoms of Apicomplexa-caused diseases and contemporary methods of diagnostics and therapy. It is noteworthy that the ticks and tick-transmitted pathogenes are distinctly increasing their distribution ranges. Besides, it is important that the ticks are adapted to use many different hosts, including birds, which increases the ticks' expansion abilities.

AB  - The tortoise tick Hyalomma aegyptium has a typical three-host life-cycle. Whereas its larvae and nymphs are less host-specific feeding on a variety of tetrapods, tortoises of the genus Testudo are principal hosts of adults. Ticks retained this trait also in our study under laboratory conditions, while adults were reluctant to feed on mammalian hosts. Combination of feeding larvae and nymphs on guinea pigs and feeding of adults on Testudo marginata tortoises provided the best results. Feeding period of females was on average 25 days (range 17-44), whereas males remain after female engorgement on tortoise host. Female pre-oviposition period was 14 days (3-31), followed by 24 days of oviposition (18-29). Pre-eclosion and eclosion, both together, takes 31 days (21-43). Larvae fed 5 days (3-9), then molted to nymphs after 17 days (12-23). Feeding period of nymphs lasted 7 days (5-10), engorged nymphs molted to adults after 24 days (19-26). Sex ratio of laboratory hatched H. aegyptium was nearly equal (1:1.09). The average weight of engorged female was 0.95 (0.72-1.12) g. The average number of laid eggs was 6,900 (6,524-7,532) per female, it was significantly correlated with weight of engorged female. Only 2.8% of engorged larvae and 1.8% of engorged nymphs remained un-molted and died. Despite the use of natural host species, feeding success of females reached only 45%. The whole life-cycle was completed within 147 days (98-215).

AB  - The morphology of erythrocytes, trombocytes, monocytes, basophils and lymphocytes on Moorish geckos (Tarentola mauritanica) is quite similar to that of other reptiles, even though some peculiarities were detected for heterophils and eosinophils. Moreover, we found a fourth type of granulocyte whose morphology highly differs from both heterophils and eosinophils. Sexually-based differences in the relative abundance of different types of leukocytes was detected: lymphocytes were the most frequent in females, while heterophils and eosinophils prevailed in males. Interestingly, in most individuals we found intra-erythrocytic vacuoles whose structure is similar to that previously described as Chelonoplasma in tortoises and Serpentoplasma in snakes.

AB  - Protozoa are common findings in chelonian practice, but the impact of many species on the animals' health status is still inadequately known and understood. The present work aims to provide clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic updates on the main protozoan species that can infect turtles and tortoises: it covers many genera across amoebas (Entamoebidae), flagellates (Tritrichomonadida, Diplomonadida), ciliates (Ciliophora), cryptosporidia (Cryptosporidiidae), coccidia (Eimeriidae, Sarcocystiidae, Haemogregarinidae, Hepatozoidae, Karyolysidae), haemosporidians (Haemoproteidae), piroplasms (Piroplasmida) and trypanosomes (Trypanosomatidae). Brief biological and morphological features, epidemiology, diagnostic techniques, clinical behaviour and pathological lesions are described. In order to avoid repetitions, therapy is presented and discussed as a self-standing paragraph at the end of the review.

AB  - Hemolivia mauritanica is an apicomplexan parasite infecting the tortoises Testudo graeca and Testudo marginata as the intermediate vertebrate host, and the tick Hyalomma aegyptium as the definitive invertebrate host. Here, we used molecular techniques to detect an apparent H. mauritanica in the ticks H. aegyptium, attached to Testudo graeca from North Africa. Sequences from 18S rRNA were used to place the new sequences, and others retrieved from GenBank, in a phylogenetic framework. A single Hemolivia haplotype was recovered from 16 ticks. Prevalence was estimated at 22.6% of hosts having ticks infected with H. mauritanica.

AB  - The paper describes 13 teratological cases of anomalies in the morphology of exotic ticks from three species: Amblyomma latum, Amblyomma flavomaculatum and Hyalomma aegyptium. The ticks parasitized reptiles (Python regius, Varanus exanthematicus, Testudo marginata), that were imported into Poland from Africa and suthern Europe for the purpose of breeding in terraria. General anomalies were found that were related to the asymmetry and bifurcation of the idiosoma and local anomalies, which are related to structures on the surface of the body: oligomely of the porose area, anomaly in the form and course of the anal groove, and anomalies of the legs: heteromorphism, oligomely and atrophy of the leg, as well as cases of complex anomalies. Knowledge of cases of morphological anomalies in ticks can help to greatly reduce taxonomic errors in determining the species affiliation of the teratologically altered tick.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationships between total calcium and phosphorus and ionised calcium and phosphorus values in clinically healthy tortoises.
   Methods: Jugular blood samples were obtained from 25 tortoises, as part of a health screen of the population. These comprised Hermann's tortoises, Testudo hermanni boettgeri, spur-thighed tortoises, Testudo graeca ibera, marginated tortoises, Testudo marginata, and horsfield tortoises, Testudo horsfieldi. Plasma from these samples were analysed for total calcium, ionised calcium and phosphorus levels. These samples were taken in the immediate posthibernation period, before the onset of reproductive activity.
   Results: Females exhibited statistically significantly higher levels of phosphorus. Ionised calcium and total calcium levels were elevated in females compared with males, but this was not statistically significant. Females did have statistically significantly higher calculated solubility indexes and statistically significantly lower ratios compared with males.
   Clinical Significance: This study has provided an insight into the ratios and solubility indexes in tortoises, and this information may lead to further understanding of the significance of these parameters in chelonians.

AB  - During spring 2018, we captured 101 spur-thighed tortoises,Testudo graeca,from seven localities in central Morocco. All tortoises were examined for the presence of blood parasitesHemolivia mauritanicaandHyalomma aegyptiumticks, the known vectors. We looked forH. mauritanicainfection by examination of blood smears and by genetic analysis with PCR using extractions from both tortoises and ticks. On all tortoises collected, 71.29% were infested with at least one tick, with a mean infestation intensity of 7.12 ticks/tortoise and maximum of 15.55 ticks/tortoises in Had Draa locality (Essaouira region). Although the definitive host is present and abundant in all tortoise populations, all blood samples wereHemolivia-negative. Our results support and confirm the finding of studies previously conducted in other populations of Morocco and indicate thatH. mauritanicahas a narrower distribution range than its tick vector.

AB  - Plasma total calcium, ionised calcium and albumin levels in Hermann's tortoises (Testudo, hermanni), spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca), marginated tortoises (Testudo, marginata) and Horsfield's tortoises (Testudo horsfieldi) were investigated. The animals were captive adults maintained under natural unfiltered sunlight in the UK with no dietary sources of cholecalciferol. Analysis of total calcium data showed statistically significant seasonal elevations in females in August compared with March (P=0.003), and statistically significant elevations in females compared with males at all sampling points (March P=0.036, June P=0.003 and August P<0.0001). These differences in values became more prominent as the summer progressed. Albumin values did not appear significantly affected by season. However, males had significantly higher albumin levels than females in the August samples. A correlation between total calcium and ionised calcium was confirmed but there was no correlation between total calcium and albumin values. Total calcium levels were a poor indication of ionised calcium levels, which constituted between 18 and 57 per cent of the total calcium value.

AB  - Abnormalities and the postnatal development of the carapace were investigated in 106 captive tortoises (Testudini-dae, Testudo hermanni boettgeri, Testudo graeca, Testudo marginata, Testudo horsfieldii) using computer tomography (CT) in live animals and/or dissection of preserved specimens. The carapace was reconstructed two-dimensionally through combining sectional images. The postnatal ossification was demonstrated in 3D CT images combined with dissection results. We found that abnormal numbers and arrangements of horny scutes and bony plates may occur independently at different locations and different ontogenetic stages. Abnormalities of the horny scutes are present at hatching when the bony plates are not yet fully formed. The temporal course of carapace ossification appears to be species-specific. We demonstrate that computer tomography is a non-invasive and convenient method suitable for studying abnormalities and the postnatal ossification process of the bony carapace, as well as for diagnostics in live chelonians. However, the resolution limit of the method will be reached in the case of very young or metabolically challenged subjects.

AB  - Testudo graeca, Testudo hermanni and Testudo marginata are endangered species listed in the IUCN Red List and Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Correct identification of species and distinct population units can support sound conservation projects and forensic applications. However, the collection of biological samples is not always easy or harmless. Blood sampling is usually invasive and risky. Salivary swab sampling is commonly used in other reptiles but can be unsafe for tortoises by the reason of their head retraction escape response. Cloacal swab sampling should be easier and less risky. In this study, we genotyped 37 tortoises at eight microsatellite loci and compared the reliability of individual genotypes obtained from blood, cloacal and buccal swabs. Results showed that performances of cloacal samples are comparable with those of buccal and blood samples, and proved that cloacal sampling is an alternative and reliable source of DNA for tortoise genotyping.

AB  - During the months of April to August in 1999 and 2002, oral swabs were collected from 146 tortoises (Testudo sp.) in private collections in the United Kingdom and tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of Mycoplasma agassizii and Chelonian herpesvirus (ChHV). The presence of M. agassizii was confirmed by restriction digestion of the PCR product. A 307-bp fragment of the ChHV UL5 homologue gene was sequenced and found to show most similarity to equine herpesvirus type 1. A prevalence of 15.8 and 8.2% was found for M. agassizii and ChHV, respectively. Comparison of the carriage of both M. agassizii and ChHV in different species of tortoises correlated the presence of M. agassizii with Testudo horsfieldii and ChHV with Testudo marginata and Testudo graeca iberia. An association of ChHV with stomatitis was also found. Mixed infections with both agents were detected. The findings further demonstrate this pathogen-tortoise association and the cross transmission of these infections if different tortoise species are housed together.

AB  - The generic name Hemolivia has been used for haemogregarines characterized by morphological and biological features. The few molecular studies, focused on other haemogregarine genera but involving Hemolivia samples, indicated its close relationship to the genus Hepatozoon. Here we analyze molecular data for Hemolivia from a broad geographic area and host spectrum and provide detailed morphological documentation of the included samples. Based on molecular analyses in context of other haemogregarines, we demonstrate that several sequences deposited in GenBank from isolates described as Hepatozoon belong to the Hemolivia cluster. This illustrates the overall difficulty with recognizing Hemolivia and Hepatozoon without sufficient morphological and molecular information. The close proximity of both genera is also reflected in uncertainty about their precise phylogeny when using 18S rDNA. They cluster with almost identical likelihood either as two sister taxa or as monophyletic Hemolivia within paraphyletic Hepatozoon. However, regardless of these difficulties, the results presented here provide a reliable background for the unequivocal placement of new samples into the Hemolivia/Hepatozoon complex.

AB  - Using mtDNA sequences and 12 microsatellite loci, we compare populations of Testudo graeca from Sardinia and North Africa. The observed pattern of almost no differentiation combined with reduced variation in the Sardinian population is consistent with introduction in prehistoric or historic times from what is now Tunisia and neighbouring Algeria. Furthermore, in the light of the recently published recommendation to eradicate the non-native T. graeca from Italy, we review recent studies on the archaeological and fossil record, on the phylogeography and population genetics of the three other chelonian species occurring in Sardinia (Emys orbicularis, T. hermanni, T. marginata). We conclude that the extant Sardinian populations of all four species are not native. However, they are and should be safeguarded under EC law (Council Regulation No 338/97 on the Protection of Species of Wild Fauna and Flora; Flora Fauna Habitat Directive: Appendix IV, Art. 12) because they serve as a back-up for the declining mainland populations. Moreover, these populations constitute an important part of the human-shaped natural heritage of the Mediterranean.

AB  - Cryptosporidiosis in squamates is well documented, but there is very limited information available on cryptosporidiosis in testudines. We describe three cases of cryptosporidiosis in tortoises with associated pathology. Two Russian tortoises (Agrionemys [Testudo] horsfieldii) and a pancake tortoise (Malacochersus tornieri), all from separate collections, were found dead. At necropsy, two had histological evidence of intestinal cryptosporidiosis and one had gastric cryptosporidiosis. Consensus Cryptosporidium sp. PCR and sequencing was used to identify the Cryptosporidium sp. present in these three tortoises. In the juvenile Russian tortoise with gastric cryptosporidiosis, the organism had 98% homology with a previously reported sequence from an Indian star tortoise isolate. A second chelonian Cryptosporidium sp. was identified in the pancake tortoise and the second Russian tortoise. This sequence was 100% identical to a shorter gene sequence previously reported in a marginated tortoise. This is the first report coordinating pathology with Cryptosporidium characterization in chelonians. The two Cryptosporidium sp. found in tortoises segregate according to site of infection, and there may be further differences in pathology, host range, and transmission. These Cryptosporidium sp. appear to be able to infect diverse tortoise host species. This may be an under-recognized problem in tortoises. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Massimo Delfino, Francesco Chesi, and Uwe Fritz (2009) Shell morphology of the Egyptian tortoise, Testudo kleinmanni Lortet, 1883, the osteologically least-known Testudo species. Zoological Studies 48(6): 850-860. The present paper provides the first detailed description of the shell osteology of Testudo kleinmanni, a small tortoise species that currently occurs only in a narrow, discontinuous strip along the southeastern Mediterranean coast, extending from Libya to Israel. Its bony shell differs from the partially codistributed species T graeca in characters present on the nuchal, suprapygal, pygal, epiplastron, entoplastron, hyoplastron, and xiphiplastron. The other shell elements are very similar in both species. For such elements, only the smaller adult size of T kleinmanni can be used for tentative species identification. Generally, shell osteology does not reflect the currently accepted sister-group relationship of T kleinmanni and T marginata (the only possible shared character may be the shape of the pectoro-abdominal sulcus). Until now, the species has never been identified from palaeontological assemblages and only very rarely in archaeological settings. The extreme rarity of fossil and subfossil records could be caused, at least in part, by the fact that diagnostic osteological characters were previously unknown. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/48.6/850.pdf

AB  - Collection of 1327 ticks sampled throughout Greece, Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia, from 211 tortoises belonging to three species, Testudo marginata Schoepff, T. graeca Linnaeus, and T. hermanni Gmelin, revealed the presence of four species of ixodid ticks, namely Hyalomma aegyptium (Linnaeus), Haemaphysalis sulcata Canestrini and Fanzago, H. inermis Birula and Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Latreille). Study confirmed the strong dominance of all life stages of H. aegyptium among ticks parasitizing west Palaearctic tortoises of genus Testudo Linnaeus. Furthermore, a considerable portion of ticks collected from tortoises in southwestern Bulgaria represent larvae and nymphs of H. sulcata. At the same area we collected as exception one larva and one nymph of H. inermis from a single specimen of T. hermanni. Our findings of four adults of R. sanguineus is the first record of this species from reptilian host. According to our results achieved on localities with syntopic occurrence of two tortoise species, T. marginata and T. graeca represent in the Balkans the principal hosts of H. aegyptium, whereas T. hermanni serves only as an alternative host in the areas close to range of either T. marginata or T. graeca.

AB  - The mining activities in the Middle Pleistocene lacustrine basin of Megalopolis (Peloponnesus, Greece) have exposed expanded sections of lacustrine sediments. In particular, the northernmost mine of Kyparissia has yielded numerous vertebrate fossils, recovered during field surveys and small-scale rescue excavations. The stratified specimens indicate the presence of at least two fossiliferous horizons, which are stratigraphically closely situated. The fossils are generally widely dispersed, but they are much more abundant along the western margin of the palaeolake. Four sites showing denser concentration of fossils were located and partially excavated during the 2004-2008 fieldwork. An additional site was identified and excavated in 2012. The fossils were found in organic-rich sediments (mostly lignites), indicating that they were deposited during a warm and humid (i.e., interglacial) time period, in a richly vegetated environment The recovered fauna is diverse, dominated by hippopotamuses, deer and elephants. The present study presents the chelonian, avian and suiform finds. The following taxa are recognised: Emys orbiadaris, Testudo marginata, Sus scrofa, Hippopotamus antiquus, as well as a diverse sample of aquatic birds. This faunal composition indicates a temperate, woodland/forest environment, with continuous presence of a large water body, whilst the presence of the darter (Anhinga sp.) points to relatively warm conditions. Biochronologically it points to an age within the early part of the Middle Pleistocene.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of whole-body plethysmography as a non-invasive method to determine the respiratory parameters and profiles in two tortoise species belonging to the genus Testudo. Pulmonary functions and volumetric parameters were determined in 10 adults of Testudo hermanni and in seven Testudo marginata animals, using whole-body plethysmography. A profile pattern was regularly observed: an inspiratory flow peak, an expiratory peak, an apnoea phase and a second expiratory peak, previous to the beginning of the next respiratory cycle. Positive and significant correlation was observed between the inspiratory time, weight and length of the tortoises. Larger tortoises showed a higher time of inhalation. The peak of inspiratory flow was correlated with the sex, being longer in the females. T. marginata had an inspiratory time longer than that of T. hermanii. In T. hermanii, differences related to the sex were observed in the tidal volume, peak inspiratory flow, peak expiratory flow, expiratory flow of 50 per cent and enhanced pause, which could be related to the smaller size of males. The results suggest that additional information on new technologies currently used in pet medicine or even in human medicine should be developed and adjusted as alternative ways to support the rehabilitation of turtles and tortoises.

AB  - Recognition of familiar individuals is important for modulating social interactions, but it is not clear to what extent this capacity depends on experience gained through repeated interactions with different animals. In wild tortoises, evidence of social interactions is limited to behaviours performed years after hatching, in the context of mating. To investigate the capacity to recognize familiar individuals at the onset of life in tortoises, we used hatchlings of two species (Testudo marginata, Testudo graeca) reared with a single conspecific as their unique social experience. When in a novel environment with the familiar conspecific, tortoises reached the distance expected after running random trajectories. In contrast, tortoises tested with an unfamiliar conspecific first explored the other tested individual, then actively kept a distance from it significantly larger than expected by chance. These results show evidence of spontaneous recognition of familiar individuals in a nonsocial species at the onset of life, and active avoidance of unfamiliar conspecifics. We suggest that this predisposition might be adaptive for young tortoises' dispersal and that evolutionary pressures for social behaviour might be relevant for nonsocial species even at the onset of life.

AB  - Testudo lunellensis Almera and Bofill, 1903 from the Middle Pleistocene of Cova de Gracia (Park Guell, Barcelona, Spain) is a valid species belonging to the clade of the extant Testudo hermanni - a diagnostic feature being the narrowed vertebral scutes. Thanks to still unpublished material, T. lunellensis is diagnosed for the first time and its shell morphology described in detail. This species is uniquely characterized, among others, by tall peripheral bones and by a peculiar shape of the anterior lobe of the plastron, somewhat recalling the species referred to Testudo s.s. (the clade containing the extant species Testudo graeca, Testudo kleinmanni and Testudo marginata). Given that the purported valid species from Lunel-Viel (Middle Pleistocene, France) is still unnamed and undescribed, T. lunellensis from Cova de Gracia is currently the stratigraphically youngest extinct Testudo species. The co-occurrence in T. lunellensis of characters typical of both T. hermanni and Testudo s.s. further testifies the phenotypic plasticity of tortoises and the mosaic distribution of morphological characters, which hinders a clear-cut assessment of the relationships of extant tortoises when based exclusively on morphology. Further analyses of the phylogeny of Testudo should consider fossil and extant taxa together, as well as both morphological and genetic characters.

AB  - The courtship behavior of male Greek tortoises (Testudo graeca) is based on a multiple signaling system that involves tactile, visual, olfactory, and acoustic signals. In some recent studies on marginated (Testudo marginata) and Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) we showed that male mounting success was significantly and positively correlated to the intensity of courtship displays. This was due to the number of rams and bites and the number of calls emitted during mounting, which are considered to be condition-dependent signals that reliably convey information on male quality. In this correlative study, we analyzed relationships between male morphology, hematological profile, courtship intensity, vocalizations, and mounting success in a group of 104 Greek tortoises breeding in seminatural enclosures. As expected, our study showed that mounting success of males was positively correlated to the number of rams and the frequency of interactions during courtship and negatively correlated to the call duration. Moreover the hematocrit was positively correlated with the call rate and the number of rams. Therefore, courtship signals exhibited by male Greek tortoises, including vocalizations, reliably reveal different components of male condition, and females may use these signals to choose high-quality partners, as previously observed in marginated and Hermann's tortoises.

AB  - Distribution pattern, prevalence and intensity of parasitaemia of heteroxenous apicomplexan blood parasite Hemolivia mauritanica and its vector tick Hyalomma aegyptium have been studied in 264 tortoises (212 Testudo graeca and 52 T. horsfieldii) throughout the Iranian territory. In T. graeca the highest prevalence and intensity of parasitaemia for H. mauritanica were recorded in the temperate mid and northern parts of the Iranian plateau, while the lowest values were found in the arid central part of Iran. No Hemolivia-positive samples were found in T. horsfieldii. Hyalomma aegyptium ticks were diagnosed in both tortoise species. The highest prevalence and intensity of infestation with H. aegyptium were recorded in western part of Iran, where climatic conditions are not so arid compared to central and eastern parts. No significant differences were found in intensity of parasitaemia of H. mauritanica between males and females. Similarly, no differences in intensity of parasitaemia were detected between different age groups (adults; more than 10 years, young; 5-10 years and juveniles; less that 5 years). Prevalence of H. mauritanica and H. aegyptium in adults was higher than in young and in juveniles. While intensity of infestation with H. aegyptium was significantly higher in adult tortoises compare to juveniles, no significant difference were found between intensity of H. aegyptium infestation in male and female tortoises.

AB  - To test phylogenetic relationships within the genus Testudo (Testudines: Testudinidae), we have sequenced a fragment of the mitochondrial (mt) 12S rRNA gene of 98 tortoise specimens belonging to the genera Testudo, Indotestudo, and Geochelone. Maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining methods identify two main clades of Mediterranean tortoises, one composed of the species Testudo graeca, Testudo marginata, and Testudo kleinmanni and a second of Testudo hermanni, Testudo horsfieldii, and Indotestudo elongata. The first clade, but not the second, was also supported by maximum parsimony analysis. Together with the genus Geochelone, a star-like radiation of these clades was suggested, as a sister-group relationship between the two Testudo clades could not be confirmed. The intraspecies genetic variation was examined by sequencing the mt 12S rRNA fragment from 28 specimens of T. graeca and 49 specimens of T. hermanni from various geographic locations. Haplotype diversity was found to be significantly larger in T. graeca compared with T. hermanni, suggestive of reduced genetic diversity in the latter species, perhaps due to Pleistocene glaciations affecting northern and middle Europe or other sources of lineage reduction. No ancient mt 12S rRNA gene haplotypes were identified in T. graeca and/or T. hermanni originating from islands in the Mediterranean Sea, suggesting that these islands harbor tortoise populations introduced from the European and African mainland.

AB  - Body mass and length data from large samples of wild Testudo graeca, T. hermanni and T. marginata in Greece were used to assess body mass condition. Mass-length relationships differed significantly between the sexes (females being heavier) and among the species (T. marginata being least heavy). Mass-length relationships for each species and sex were used to calculate the condition index (CI) log (MMt), where M is observed mass and M' is mass predicted from length, which is equal to residuals from the regression of log M on log length. It was possible to use the empirical mass-length relationships from one population of T. hermanni to calculate CI in other populations of substantially different adult size. The seasonal pattern of the CI varied with latitude, with a sharper and later peak further north, and habitat, declining more in summer at a xeric coastal site. The seasonal patterns of CI in T. graeca and T. marginata were similar, with sharper and later peaks compared to T. hermanni. These seasonal patterns of CI were related to differences in activity and food availability among species and sites. The variability of the CI was similar in all three species, with most values between -0.1 and +0.1; seasonal variation was of relatively low amplitude, with a range of about 0.05 between the highest and lowest monthly means.

AB  - Research was undertaken to clarify the true taxonomic position of the terrestrial tortoise apicomplexan, Haemogregarina fitzsimonsi (Dias, 1953). Thin blood films were screened from 275 wild and captive South African tortoises of 6 genera and 10 species between 2009-2011. Apicomplexan parasites within films were identified, with a focus on H. fitzsimonsi. Ticks from wild tortoises, especially Amblyomma sylvaticum and Amblyomma marmoreum were also screened, and sporogonic stages were identified on dissection of adult ticks of both species taken from H. fitzsimonsi infected and apparently non-infected tortoises. Parasite DNA was extracted from fixed, Giemsa-stained tortoise blood films and from both fresh and fixed ticks, and PCR was undertaken with two primer sets, HEMO1/HEMO2, and HepF300/HepR900, to amplify parasite 18S rDNA. Results indicated that apicomplexan DNA extracted from tortoise blood films and both species of tick had been amplified by one or both primer sets. Haemogregarina fitzsimonsi 18S rDNA sequences fromtortoise blood aligned with those of species of Hepatozoon, rather than those of species of Haemogregarina or Hemolivia. It is recommended therefore that this haemogregarine be re-assigned to the genus Hepatozoon, making Hepatozoon fitzsimonsi (Dias, 1953) the only Hepatozoon known currently from any terrestrial chelonian. Ticks are its likely vectors.

AB  - The 18S rRNA gene is a widely used molecular marker for haemogregarines. In recent decades, many primers more or less specific to various haemogregarine genera have been designed. This study applied five commonly used primers targeting the 18S rRNA gene of haemogregarines to blood sam-ples from 168 individuals of nine turtle species captured in Northern Vietnam. Three haemogregarine genera, Haemogregarina, Hemolivia, and Hepatozoon, were detected. Selective specificity of primers EF/ER, HemoFN/HemoRN, and Hemo1/Hemo2 to haemogregarine genera was observed and elucidated by primer-template mismatches. In total, 13 out of 168 turtles (prevalence 7.7%) were both microscopically and PCR positive for haemogregarines. Additionally, a single Heosemys grandis tur-tle was PCR positive but microscopically negative. Numerous turtles carried mixed infections by var-ious haemogregarines; a single turtle was even coinfected by haemogregarines of all three studied genera: Haemogregarina, Hemolivia, and Hepatozoon. Among the detected haemogregarines, some provided sufficient molecular and morphological data for completing their species diagnosis. Two were described as new species: Haemogregarina cyclemydis sp. nov. from Cyclemys pulchristriata and Hemolivia cruciata sp. nov. from Cuora galbinifrons, so far the first Hemolivia from Southeast Asia. Haemogregarina cuorae Chai and Chen, 1990, required a redescription with reassignment to the genus Hepatozoon Miller, 1908.(c) 2022 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Three species of tortoise (Testudinidae) occur in Greece (Testudo hermanni, T. graeca and the endemic T. marginata), all of which have been listed as rare or vulnerable. This paper describes the current situation of 75 populations that were last observed in the 1970s and 1980s and described in 1989. Twenty-nine populations had declined in density and/or status (significantly more than had improved), 10 of which were functionally extinct. A particularly notable loss was a dense population of T. marginata at Gytheion in the Peloponnese due to a widespread fire. Declining populations were significantly associated with identified high threat in 1989 and with close proximity to human settlement. There were no significant effects of tortoise species, area of site, characteristics of surrounding areas or original density on these changes. Declines were less associated with agriculture than predicted in 1989, reflecting changing economic conditions in Greece in the 1990s. Continuing threats to tortoise habitats make their long-term future appear bleak outside of protected areas. The risk of extinction from stochastic variation in small populations was also assessed, using the VORTEX program. This risk was much lower than that from habitat loss; 60-96% of populations of 100 tortoises would survive for 1000 years, depending on adult body size, compared to only 0-0.02% of habitats. The high survival potential of small populations would facilitate conservation of the high intraspecific diversity of tortoises in Greece.

AB  - Apicomplexan haemoparasites of the genera Schellackia Reichenow, 1919, and Karyolysus Labbe, 1894, seem to be common in lizards and widespread across the world. For decades, their identification has been based on morphological descriptions and life cycle patterns, with molecular characterizations, applied only recently. We used molecular characterization to confirm the identification of haemoparasites detected by microscopy in blood smears of Lacerta schreiberi Bedriaga, 1878, a lizard of the Iberian Peninsula. Since blood samples other than blood smears were not available from the studied lizards, 264 engorged ticks Ixodes ricinus (Linneaus, 1758) collected from them were used as an alternative non-invasive source of haemoparasite DNA for molecular genetic analyses. Of the 48 blood smears microscopically examined, 31 were positive for blood parasites (64.6% prevalence). We identified trophozoites and gamonts similar to Karyolysus lacazei (Labbe, 1894) (24/48; 50%) and Schellackia-like sporozoites (20/48; 41.7%). Mixed infections with both species occurred in 13 blood smears (27.1%). Sequence data were obtained for both parasites from engorged ticks. Phylogenetic analyses placed our unique haemogregarine sequence within the Karyolysus clade, nevertheless, within substantial polytomy. Thus, according to its morphology and effect on the host cell, we refer to this haemogregarine as Karyolysus cf. lacazei. Besides the Schellackia sequences being identical to a previously identified haplotype, we also obtained sequences of three new closely related haplotypes.

T2  - HERPETOLOGICAL JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - The activity patterns and body temperatures of T. hermanni and T. marginta were studied in the Peloponnese (southern Greece) during May, June, August and October 1984.
   T. hermanni
   In May the daily activity patterns of T. hermanni were unimodal, in June and August they were bimodal.  In August during the afternoon the activity increased significantly, in October the activity was very low.
   In August basking decreased significantly and mating increased significantly.
   During these four months no significant differences in body temperatures were found.  In May a maximum body temperature of 35-degrees-C was found; in feeding tortoises a maximum temperature of 34-degrees-C.  After May no temperatures over 32-degrees-C were found.
   T. marginata
   In May and June the activity patterns of T. marginata were bimodal with the highest activity during the afternoon.  In August an unimodal low activity pattern was found during the afternoon.  In October the activity of T. marginata was unimodal and shifted towards the middle of the day.  Sexual activity was seen in October only.
   Body temperatures in all T. marginata samples were significantly higher than those in T. hermanni.  During May a maximum body temperature of 36-degrees-C was found in basking tortoises, a maximum of 37-degrees-C in feeding tortoises.
   The trend towards lower body temperatures in summer was greater in T. marginata than in T. hermanni.  Body temperatures found in feeding tortoises in October equalled those found in May.
   Ecological Consequences
   In southern Greece the habitat separation between T. hermanni and T. marginata can be explained by morphological differences and a higher body temperature tolerance in T. marginata.  Differences in the annual cycle of activities might also be of importance as regards the habitat separation between both species.

AB  - Blood films were examined from 154 wild and captive tortoises from four provinces of South Africa, including Gauteng, Kwazulu-Natal, North West and Western Cape. The five species of chelonians studied were Chersina angulata (Schweigger), Kinixys belliana belliana (Gray), K. lobatsiana Power, K. natalensis Hewitt, and Stigmochelys pardalis (Bell). Two species of haemogregarines, previously reported from Mozambique, were identified in blood films, namely Haemogregarina fitzsimonsi Dias, 1953 and Haemogregarina parvula Dias, 1953. Additional stages of development (trophozoites and probable meronts, merozoites and immature gamonts) in blood preparations from South Africa warranted the redescription of H. fitzsimonsi. A variety of hosts and broad host distribution range were observed for this haemogregarine, with all five species of tortoises parasitized, wild and captive, from all four provinces, in all seasons. In contrast, only two individuals of K. b. belliana and one S. pardalis, all three captive in Kwazulu-Natal, contained H. parvula with encapsulated stages resembling those of Hemolivia mauritanica (Sergent et Sergent, 1904). For H. fitzsimonsi, parasite prevalences, but not parasitaemias, were significantly higher in captive than wild S. pardalis; captive female S. pardalis also showed a significantly greater prevalence of infection than males, but younger, lighter hosts were not significantly more heavily parasitized than older, heavier individuals. The ticks, Amblyomma marmoreum Koch, 1844 and A. sylvaticum (De Geer, 1778), found attached to some tortoises, may prove to be definitive hosts for the two species of haemogregarines observed.

AB  - Hyalomma aegyptium ticks were collected from tortoises, Testudo graeca, at localities in northern Africa, the Balkans, and the Near and Middle East. The intensity of infestation ranged from 1-37 ticks per tortoise. The sex ratio of feeding ticks was male-biased in all tested populations. Larger tortoises carried more ticks than did the smaller tortoises. The juveniles were either not infested, or carried only a poor tick load. Hyalomma aegyptium was absent in the western Souss Valley and Ourika Valley in Morocco, the Cyrenaica Peninsula in Libya, Jordan, and the Antilebanon Mountains in Syria. Hemolivia mauritanica, a heteroxenous apicomplexan cycling between T. graeca and H. aegyptium, was confirmed in Algeria, Romania, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Iran. Its prevalence ranged from 84% in Romania (n = 45), 82% in eastern Turkey (n = 28), and 82% in the area of northwestern Syria with adjacent Turkish borderland (n = 90), to 38% in Lebanon (n = 8) and in only I of 16 sampled tortoises in Algeria. The intensity of parasitemia in the studied areas ranged from 0.01% up to 28.17%. The percentage of Hemolivia-infected erythrocytes was significantly higher in adults. All tortoises from Hyalomma-free areas were Hemolivia-negative. Remarkably, all 29 T. graeca from Jabal Duruz (southwestern Syria) and 36 T. graeca from the area north of Middle Atlas (Morocco) were Hemolivia-negative, despite the fact that ticks parasitized all adult tortoises in these localities. Identical host preferences of H. aegyptium and H. mauritanica suggest the occurrence of co-evolution within the Testudo-Hyalomma-Hemolivia host-parasite complex,

AB  - The aim of the investigations was to draw up reference blood values of European tortoises, which are more and more frequent patients in veterinary practice. Blood samples were taken from the Vena jugularis from 229 clinically healthy adult European tortoises, belonging to the species Testudo hermanni, T. graeca, T. marginata and Agrionemys horsfieldii. Blood samples were taken during the period of a year. The following 31 parameters were examined (results = mean value +/- standard deviation): haemoglobin (7.84 +/- 1.86 g/dl), PCV (28.0 +/- 6.1%), red cell count (0.63 +/- 0.19 x 10(6)/mul) and white cell count (8.73 +/- 6.86 x 10(3)/mul) including differentiation of lymphocytes, heterophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, calcium (8.7 +/- 6.7 mg/dl), magnesium (5.1 +/- 2.5 mg/dl), phosphorus (5.1 +/- 3.1 mg/dl), alkaline phosphatase (445 +/- 293 IU/l), alanine aminotransferase (22 +/- 18 IU/l), aspartate aminotransferase (108 +/- 79 IU/l), gamma-glutamyltansferase (0 IU/l), lactate dehydrogenase (1433 +/- 1029 IU/l), creatine kinase (1156 +/- 1379 IU/l), amylase (190 +/- 96 IU/l), lipase (57 +/- 42 IU/l), glucose (67.9 +/- 38.1 mg/dl), total protein (4.6 +/- 1.6 mg/dl), albumin (1.6 +/- 0.8 mg/dl), globulin (2.9 mg/dl), urea (18.1 +/- 55.9 mg/dl), uric acid (3.2 +/- 1.9 mg/dl), ammonia (519 +/- 314 mu mol/l), creatinine (0.14 +/- 0.15 mg/dl), cholesterol (141 +/- 70 mg/dl), triglycerides (285 +/- 264 mg/dl) and total bilirubin (0 mg/dl). Nine parameters showed statistically significant differences between sexes. 14 parameters showed more or less clearly distinct statistically significant seasonal variations. Species specific variations occurred in 11 parameters. 20 parameters were influenced by the conditions of husbandry. Blood samples may yield valuable information especially on infections, renal and liver disease in tortoises.
