AB  - The Testudo graeca (i.e., Greek Tortoise or Spur-thighed Tortoise) origin in Western Europe is a subject of debate within the scientific community. The species is a part of the current Spanish biodiversity, with three isolated populations, located in the south-eastern (Almeria and Murcia) and south-western (Donana National Park, Andalusia) areas of the Iberian Peninsula, and in the Mallorca Island (Balearic Islands). Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, putative references to the presence of Testudo graeca in the Iberian paleontological and archaeozoological records were relatively common. However, many of them were refuted in subsequent papers and, those that were not, are currently considered as doubtful. The aim of this work is to present and describe the oldest indisputable remains of Testudo graeca in the Iberian Peninsula. They correspond to several individuals, hitherto unpublished, recovered as grave goods in two tombs at the Plaza Marques de Busianos 5 site (Valencia, eastern Spain), dated between the first and second centuries AD.

AB  - A 15-month-old Spur-thighed Tortoise (Testudo graeca iberica) with a bodyweight of 66 g, was presented after the referring veterinarian had detected a urolith. Regarding the results of the physical and radiographic examinations, surgical removal of the urolith via the left prefemoral fossa was elected. The urolith could be removed completely. A microbiological swab of the urinary bladder revealed a moderate growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pantoea sp. The biochemical blood analysis showed an elevation of the uric acid level (6.72 mg/dL). An analysis of the urolith was done using infrared spectroscopy and showed a composition of 100% potassium urate. The Spur-thighed Tortoise was given analgesic and antibiotic treatment as well as a xanthine oxidase blocker.

AB  - Collection for the pet trade has been considered one of the major threats to the Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca, since it modulates the size and structure of the species' populations and, therefore, their demography. Maamora forest is one of the most suitable habitats for this species. The proximity of the forest to Rabat indicated the possibility of these tortoise populations being particularly sensitive to over-collecting. Population demography was studied in four populations, in protected and unprotected areas in Maamora forest. The results showed significant differences as regards population size and structure between protected and unprotected areas. They specifically highlighted: i) higher density (23-17 indiv.ha(-1)) balanced populations in the protected areas, in which young adults were predominant, ii) a higher body condition in the protected areas, especially the females, and iii) a low density (5.5 ind.ha(-1)) more unbalance population in the unprotected areas, in which older females and younger males were predominant. In addition, a survey carried out by interviewing local adults (n = 200) showed that most people owned tortoises (61%, n = 200), mainly juveniles (65%, n = 123). The respondents stated that their tortoises had been captured in the forest (68%, n = 123). Maamora forest is home to one of the highest density populations of Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoises documented to date, and its conservation is essential if this species is to be maintained. Our social survey suggested that one of the challenges is to change the social perception of the Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise as a pet and highlight its intrinsic ecological value.

AB  - The spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca L., 1758) is classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN. In this context, it is important to explore the factors affecting its populations to set up an effective conservation plan. The present study was carried out in seven localities of Morocco with the objective to determine the ticks parasitizing this tortoise and their prevalence in relation to host characteristics and environmental factors. We examined 392 free-living tortoises for the presence of ticks during the spring 2018. A total number of 2238 adult ticks (no immature tick detected) were collected and all identified as Hyalomma aegyptium. Infection with at least one tick was detected in 77.6% +/- 6.5 of the total tortoises. The infestation prevalence varied according to localities. Infestation intensity varied from 1.5 to 12, while tick abundance ranged from 0.65 to 12 ticks/tortoise. Male tortoises were more infested than females (P < 0.01) and the infestation was age-dependant. Our statistical result provides that the best model drivers tick parasitism was which included locality and age. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of the high intensity of H. aegyptium infestation on the tortoise's health status and to assess the potential transmission of zoonotic pathogens.

TI  - First records of Hyalomma aegyptium (Acari : Ixodida : Ixodidae) from the Russian spur-thighed tortoise, Testudo graeca nikolskii, with an analysis of tick population dynamics
T2  - JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - During the fall of 1995 and the spring of 1996, 77 statistically comparable tick collections, comprising 792 specimens, were made from adults of the Russian spur-thighed tortoise, Testudo graeca nikolskii, at 4 sites along Russia's Black Sea coast. These are the first tick collections reported from T. g. nikolskii since its recognition as a taxonomic entity. All ticks were determined to be Hyalomma (Hyalomma) aegyptium, a common tortoise parasite in southern Russia that in 1930 was erroneously designated the type of subgenus Hyalommasta. Male ticks were recovered from more tortoises (67) than were females (57) or immatures (14), and nymphs were seen only in the fall. Significantly more ticks parasitized male tortoises than females, perhaps because males of T. g. nikolskii have larger home ranges. However, no functional relationship was found between tortoise ventral surface area and degree of tick infestation. Like other tortoise ticks, H. aegyptium is expected to decline in concert with its increasingly threatened hosts.

AB  - This report describes stifle luxation resultant from multiple ligamentous injuries in a spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca). Despite an absence of obvious trauma in the case history, the tortoise presented with acute, unilateral hind limb lameness. Diagnosis of stifle luxation was based on cranial drawer motion, increased rotational joint instability, and radiographic findings. Joint stabilization was accomplished by a combination of cranial cruciate reconstruction using an autograft of lateral vastus muscle in an over-the-top procedure and lateral imbrication of the joint capsule. Postoperative management included restriction of limb movement for 6 wk and parenteral chondroprotective regime. Treatment was effective in restoring clinically normal function to the limb.

AB  - Demography and population biology aspects of the Moorish tortoise, Testudo graeca graeca were studied in the Pare National d'El Kala, north-eastern Algeria. Density, which was assessed by capture-mark-recapture procedures in a study plot of 30 ha surface, was 3.73 individuals x ha(-1). Adult sex-ratio was nearly equal (1.06:1). Sexual maturity was reached at 7-8 years of age in the males and at 9-11 years in the females. The mean age of tortoises was 13.8 +/- 6.4 years (n = 88). Maximum longevity was over 20 years in both sexes. The females reached larger body size than the males. The growth was rapid during the early years of age in both sexes, and tended to stop completely by the 9-12 years of life in the males and by the 8-10 years in the females. The instantaneous growth of adults which were recaptured in multiple years indicated an average growth rate of 11.34 mm/year in the males, and of 26.30 mm/year in the females. Mortality was estimated at 3.94%. The main mortality cause for the tortoises of this population was the occurrence of fires spreading throughout the study area. These data are of interest because demographic patterns of Testudo graeca seem to vary not only because of their relative genetical variability, but also because of their relative environmental stress.

AB  - Human-mediated secondary contact of recently diverged taxa offers valuable opportunities for studying the evolutionary mechanisms involved in the establishment and maintenance of genetic boundaries between taxa. We used mitochondrial and microsatellite markers to examine a recently introduced population of the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) of mixed origin in the Donana National Park (SW Spain). The earliest records of tortoises in Donana trace back to the 18th century, but several population reinforcements in the 20th century with animals from Morocco are welldocumented. Consequently, different genetic lineages, which represent distinct subspecies, are thought to co-exist there. Our results confirmed the presence of distinct lineages by revealing that tortoises of the subspecies T. g. marokkensis were introduced into a local allochthonous T. g. graeca population. Unexpectedly, T. g. marokkensis haplotypes exclusively appeared in males, and admixture levels were statistically sex-biased toward males. The sex ratio of the population deviated from parity, with males being 2.36-fold more abundant than females. Our results indicated that population reinforcements had a strong effect on the genetic composition of this population and aggravated its sex ratio deviation. We predict that this sex-biased pattern of introgression is ephemeral and advocated to the near loss of T. g. marokkensis haplotypes.

AB  - We studied plastron-shaped asymmetry of the Eurasian Spur-Thighed Tortoise, Testudo graeca ibera, as related to life stage, gender, and distribution. Our analyses of 523 individuals showed that fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in plastron shape varied with gender (males exhibited higher levels of FA than did females) and across populations, whereas life stage had no significant effect. Although we could not identify the potential sources of variation responsible for the observed patterns of developmental instability, our study shows the value of FA as a method for studies of developmental instability in turtles.

AB  - A 13-year-old male spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) was presented with anorexia, apathy, and prolapse of penile tissue. Ultrasonography revealed a large heterogeneous mass in the coelomic cavity, and fine-needle aspiration demonstrated sperm. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a sharply defined mass originating from the left testis. Appearance and signal intensities were similar to those reported in testicular neoplasms in humans, in particular sharing similarities with seminomas. Necropsy results and histopathological findings were consistent with a seminoma. To the authors' knowledge this is the first report of the diagnosis of testicular neoplasia in a reptile using imaging techniques. (C) 2014 American College of Veterinary Radiology.

AB  - A 22-day-old dicephalic spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca ibera) died following a history of lethargy, anorexia and absence of defecation. The two heads were anatomically similar with independent reaction to external stimuli. The carapace showed doubled first and extra second vertebral scutes. Radiography and transplastronal ultrasonography, performed when the animal was alive, revealed two symmetrical stomachs and two asynchronous hearts. These findings were confirmed by necropsy examination. Oesophagus, liver, gallbladder and trachea were also duplicated. Other malformations included pyloric valve atresia of the left stomach, focal stenosis of the transverse colon and liver hypoplasia. Dicephalism rarely occurs in Testudinidae and its pathogenesis, still unclear, is discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is shown that the location data for the terra typica restricta of Testudo graeca and for the terra typica designate for Testudo graeca are based on an incorrectly assigned location. In fact, the original place corresponds to Santa Cruz, known today as Agadir (Morocco) and not the old Spanish fortress of Santa Cruz near Oran in Algeria. Accordingly, populations of Testudo graeca from the Agadir environment have to be named Testudo graeca graeca instead of Testudo graeca soussensis. For the populations of Testudo graeca from the vicinity of Algiers, "mauritanica" is the next available name for this subspecies of gmeca. Therefore, Testudo graeca Inauritanica has to be used instead of Testudo graeca graeca. For Testudo gram: maurilaitica, a lectotypus is designated.

Two recent studies applied different approaches to infer range dynamics in eastern subspecies of the spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca Linnaeus, 1758. We discuss differences in the conclusions of the two papers and use multivariate environmental similarity surface (MESS) analyses to show that the results of the study by Turkozan et al.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the main drivers threatening biodiversity. Together with the direct effects of exurban sprawl (e.g., habitat loss), the behavior of new residents may have important implications for species conservation. This manuscript addresses the effects of exurban sprawl on the collection and captivity of the endangered spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) in southeastern Spain. In June 2004, we undertook 362 structured interviews with exurban residents. Our results showed that most of the 12% of new residents who keeps tortoises in captivity have collected them from the wild (51%). Reintroductions and captive breeding were also frequent practices (24% and 26%, respectively). These practices, which are expected to increase in forthcoming years, might have important implications for the conservation of the species (local extinction, disease spread, or genetic mixing). Paradoxically, new residents collect tortoises to "protect'' wild individuals from natural and anthropic threats. Therefore, even though many new residents are concerned about the spur-thighed tortoise, they do not practice sound conservation measures. This study highlights the importance of incorporating human dimensions for wildlife into planning for urban sprawl. (C) 2012 The Wildlife Society.

Material and methods: The case of a Spur-thighed Tortoise (Testudo graeca)that was presented with shell secretion after hibernation is presented and discussed Results: By the means of X-Ray and CT the diagnosis osteolytic shell necrosis was obtained. After aggressive surgical debridement under anaesthesia shell healing could be achieved by thorough wound management. In microbiological cultures, a fungus of the species Scopulariopsis-cause of onychomycosis in people-was isolated next to various bacterial agents. Conclusion: Even deep shell abscesses may heal satisfyingly under intensive wound management. This is the first described case of shell necrosis in a tortoise with possible involvement of a keratinolytic fungus of the species Scopulariopsis.

AB  - An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for the detection of antibodies to a herpesvirus associated with an upper respiratory tract disease in Mediterranean tortoises [spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) and Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni)]. This serodiagnostic test was validated through a hyperimmunization study. The mean of the A(405) readings of the plasma samples collected at time zero of the hyperimmunization study plus three times the standard deviation was used as the cutoff for seropositivity in tortoises. ELISA results were compared to serum neutralization (SN) values for the same samples by using the McNemar test. The results obtained by SN and ELISA were not significantly different (P>0.05). This new ELISA could be used as an important diagnostic tool for screening wild populations and private and zoo collections of Mediterranean tortoises.

AB  - Morphological variation among a population of Testudo graeca from two neighbouring sites of the Nemrut Volcano has been analysed, and six morphometric characters have been assessed in 305 specimens, mainly adults. This population shows remarkable morphometric differences. Macrohabitat differences among sites have been involved to explain this variability in the light of the huge morphological plasticity of this wide-ranging taxon.

AB  - As a result of human activities, natural Mediterranean landscapes (including agro-ecosystems) are characterised by a mosaic-like structure with habitat-patches at different successional stages. These systems have high biodiversity levels and are home to a large number of species protected by European laws whose habitats should be adequately managed. In the present work, we study habitat use from an applied point of view in the spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca, an endangered reptile present in semi-arid Mediterranean agro-ecosystems. Results show that, at a landscape scale, the species selects simplified vegetation structures and includes in its home range re-colonisation shrubland and small non-irrigated fields. Within the home range, habitat selection patterns vary and areas with higher vegetation cover and complexity are selected. Detected patterns are discussed in terms of the ecological requirements of the species and with a hierarchical view of resources and conditions. The implications of our findings for habitat management aimed at the conservation of the species are also discussed.

AB  - Free-ranging spur-thighed tortoises Testudo graeca, captured in different habitat types of Northern Tunisia from March to April 2017, were examined for tick infestation: 134/147 (91%) were infested. The overall infestation intensity and abundance was 8.5 and 7.8, respectively. From these tortoises, 1174 ticks were collected, of which 10% (n = 120) taken from 18 randomly-selected tortoises were identified at the species level; the remaining ticks were examined for the presence of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFv) by real time RT-PCR. Only adult Hyalomma aegyptium were found, suggesting a high degree of host specificity to tortoises. No CCHFv was detected in ticks. Considering the absence of CCHFv in Hyalomma aegyptium infesting its main host, the spur-thighed tortoise, this tick species is unlikely to play a major role in the epidemiology of CCHF. Therefore, more studies are needed to investigate the circulation of this arbovirus between livestock and other tick species from North Africa.

AB  - The spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca has a wide distribution encompassing southern Europe and the Middle East through to northern Africa. The populations at the northern limit of T. graeca's range in the province of Dobrogea (Romania) are sparsely distributed across the entire area, with higher densities found in the hilly forested areas. Although strictly protected, the spur-thighed tortoise was and continues to be impacted by human activities. This study investigated the presence and characteristics of scars from past injuries on their shells. We studied three populations from protected areas, situated along a north-south gradient of approximately 150 km: Macin Mountains National Park (northernmost limit of T. graeca's range), Cetatea Histria, located within the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve, in the central part of the region, and the Dumbraveni Forest Natural Reserve in the south. All three populations had individuals with scars from past injuries on their shells. The highest numbers of injured tortoises were in Dumbraveni Forest (35.78%) and Macin Mountains (35%) while the population from Cetatea Histria (11.26%) was less affected. Carapace injury frequency was higher in the Macin Mountains whilst the Dumbraveni Forest population had a higher frequency of plastron injuries. Human-caused injuries were observed mainly in the anterior and dorsal zones of the carapace and the anterior zone of the plastron. Natural injuries were located on the posterior zone of the carapace, mainly on marginal scutes. Our study showed that the scars of turtle shells proved to be an excellent depository of past and recent human impacts and may offer insights for better conservation and management strategies.

AB  - Ultrasonography was used to diagnose pericardial effusion, atrial dilatation and liver masses in a spur-thighed tortoise which was more than 80 years old and suffering from posthibernation anorexia. lethargy. oedema and pneumonia. The tortoise was treated twice with frusemide and ceftazidime for the pneumonia, resulting each time in a temporary remission for about a month. After a further recurrence, the animal was euthanased and the lesions predicted by ultrasound were confirmed postmortem. It is suggested that ultrasound may be useful for the differentiation of cardiac problems from other causes of posthibernation lethargy in the tortoise.

AB  - In semi-arid areas of the Saharan Atlas region in Algeria, 33 tortoises (Testudo graeca) were examined for ticks in 2017-2018. All ticks found were adults and they were identified as Hyalomma aegyptium. For the total sample studied, the infestation prevalence was 63.6 %. The mean infestation intensity was 4.04 and the parasite abundance was 2.57. The infestation prevalence, the mean infestation intensity and the parasite abundance in female tortoises were higher than in males, but this variation was statistically insignificant. The number of ticks was positively and significantly correlated with tortoises' body measurements: body weight, straight carapace length, carapace height, mid-body carapace width and plastron length. The parasitism by female and male ticks separately was not statistically significant. A total of 40 % of ticks were found attached to the hind limbs, 37.7 % to the forelimbs, 10.6 % to the neck, 11.7% to the tail, and no individuals were detected on the carapace. Statistically, the forelimbs and the neck were the preferred attachment areas for H. aegyptium.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry has been proposed as a useful noninvasive tool for detecting the influence of the environment on body development. In the present study, we used digital images to estimate the fluctuating asymmetry of the plastron in an isolated Testudo graeca population in Dobrogea, Romania. We extracted data from the photos regarding the area, height, and width of 3 plastron scutes. A total of 155 adult tortoises analysed showed reduced variation in plastron asymmetry and no significant relationship was detected between fluctuating asymmetry and sex or body size. We suggest that fluctuating asymmetry may be an individual trait, with no predictive value at the population level.

AB  - Ticks are regularly encountered ectoparasites of tortoises and play an important role in the transfer of viruses, bacteria and protozoa. There exist only few in situ investigations on tick infestations of Testudo graeca LINNAEUS, 1758. This is why the authors documented tick infestations observed during a field excursion to Morocco in April and May 2010.
   Eight out of twelve tortoises detected were infested (by 21 ticks). All ticks were identified as imagines of Hyalomma aegyptium (LINNAEUS, 1758). Additionally, an overview is given of the literature sources upon ticks as parasites of Testudo graeca and their significance as vectors for diseases.

AB  - Identifying key evolutionary strategies that support population persistence remains a challenging task for biodiversity conservation. Here we assess if animal adaptations to cope with low densities (i.e. that facilitate mate-findings or promote spatial aggregation of individuals) can allow species to persist in human-altered habitats. A spatially explicit and individual-based model was developed to assess if, and under what circumstances, such adaptations maintain population viability. The model was parameterised with data from the movement and demography of the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) and simulated scenarios with differences in adult survivorships, initial population Sizes and habitat alterations. Habitat alterations reduced population viability, and extinction rates were dependent on population characteristics and mate-finding distance. In contrast, philopatry around the birthplace did not prevent extinctions. Our results highlight the importance of considering specific spatial traits of species when assessing their vulnerability to human habitat alterations.

AB  - Fire is a key ecological process in several biomes worldwide. Over recent decades, human activities (e.g. rural abandonment, monoculture plantations) and global warming are magnifying the risk of fire, with changes in fire intensity and frequency. Here, we offer the first study that examines the impact of fire on the spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca living in a native cork oak forest and pine plantation in north-western Africa. A total of 44 transects (22 burnt and 22 unburnt) were sampled at 8 sites affected by fires of natural cork oak forest and pine plantation with 8 surveys per site in 2015-2017 (264 hours of sampling effort). Tortoise densities were estimated with line-transect distance sampling. The detection probability of tortoises was higher in burnt (0.915) than unburnt (0.474) transects. The density of tortoises was negatively associated with elevation and declined with fire by c. 50% in both forest types. The negative response of T. graeca to fire should be considered in conservation planning of this species in north-western Africa in a future scenario of changes in fire regime.

AB  - An adult female Greek tortoise (Testudo graeca) presented with dyspnea. lethargy, and anorexia. Severe unilateral pulmonary candidiasis was diagnosed and confirmed by histologic and microbiologic evaluations. Initial treatment with ketoconazole resulted in plasma elevations of aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase. and bile acids consistent with imidazole-induced hepatotoxicity. Plasma chemistry abnormalities resolved upon withdrawal of the drug. Temporary osteotomy permitted access to the diseased lung and facilitated intrapulmonary catheterization. Intrapulmonary amphotericin B therapy at 0.1 mg/kg s.i.d. for 34 days proved to be both safe and effective in this case.

AB  - Tortoises of the genus Testudo are commonly kept pets on the Maltese Islands. This is a first record of the presence of Hyalomma aegyptium (Linnaeus 1758), also known as the "tortoise tick," on Malta. Two male H. aegyptium were collected from an adult Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca Linnaeus 1758) and a further two male H. aegyptium were collected from an adult female Egyptian tortoise (Testudo kleinmanni Lortet 1883). These tortoises were believed to be illegally imported, wild-caught specimens from North Africa. The presence of H. aegyptium on Malta is of both biological and medical relevance since these ticks are known potential vectors for numerous zoonotic diseases. This is also believed to be the first record of T. kleinmanni as a host for H. aegyptium.

AB  - We studied growth of 284 live Moorish tortoises (Testudo graeca graeca) from the central Jbilet Mountains, the Admine Forest, and near Essaouira in westcentral Morocco in 2001. Size structures, but not age structures, differed significantly among populations. No very old tortoises were found at any site. Most populations of tortoises suffered over-collecting for the tourist trade in the past, and some collecting still continues, which probably explains the lack of older tortoises. Of tortoises remaining in the populations we studied, both males and females grew relatively quickly for 10-12 yr in all three populations, after which their growth rates deceased markedly. Females in all three populations had greater asymptotic sizes than males, and CL and log mass differed significantly between sexes by age 9 yr for the three populations, except for log mass of tortoises from Essaouira, which differed by age 6. Mean CLs and log masses were significantly greater in Admine and Essaouira tortoises than in tortoises from Jbilet. Estimated mean age at maturity varied from 5.8 to 7.6 yr for males and 7.7-10.5 yr for females. Although past over-collecting of tortoises has probably depressed population abundances and eliminated the larger, older tortoises at all three sites, the current differences in population structure and growth pattern may be the result of geographic variation in environmental conditions, suggesting different selective mechanisms for the three populations.

AB  - Background: To help conservation programs of the endangered spur-thighed tortoise and to gain better insight into its systematics, genetic variation and evolution in the tortoise species Testudo graeca (Testudines: Testudinidae) was investigated by sequence analysis of a 394-nucleotide fragment of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene for 158 tortoise specimens belonging to the subspecies Testudo graeca graeca, Testudo graeca ibera, Testudo graeca terrestris, and a newly recognized subspecies Testudo graeca whitei. A 411-nucleotide fragment of the mitochondrial D-loop was additionally sequenced for a subset of 22 T. graeca, chosen because of their 12S gene haplotype and/or geographical origin.
   Results: Haplotype networks generated by maximum-likelihood and neighbor-joining analyses of both the separate and the combined sequence data sets suggested the existence of two main clades of Testudo graeca, comprising Testudo graeca from northern Africa and Testudo graeca from the Turkey and the Middle East, respectively.
   Conclusion: Mitochondrial DNA haplotyping suggests that the tortoise subspecies of T. g. graeca and T. g. ibera are genetically distinct, with a calculated divergence time in the early or middle Pleistocene. Other proposed subspecies could not clearly be recognized based upon their mt haplotypes and phylogenetic position, and were either part of the T. g. graeca or of the T. g. ibera clade, suggesting that genetic evidence for the existence of most of the 15 proposed subspecies of T. graeca is weak.

AB  - From March to April 2017, a total of 147 free-ranging spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) was captured in different habitat types of northern Tunisia and examined for tick infestation. A total of 134 was infested, yielding an infestation prevalence of 91.2%. From these tortoises, 1,174 ticks were collected, a subsample (10%, n=120) of which was randomly selected and identified; the remaining ticks were stored at -80 C and examined for zoonotic pathogens. Only adult Hyalomma aegyptium were found among the subsample of ticks collected for spur-thighed tortoise. The prevalence of tick infestation did not vary significantly within the study area but differences in intensity were observed in relation to the size of tortoises and the vegetation coverage. Our results provide strong evidence that adult H. aegyptium is the predominant tick species found on wild spur-thighed tortoises in northern Tunisia, where the species is commonly traded illegally across the Mediterranean Basin. Considering the potential transmission of several zoonotic pathogens by H. aegyptium to humans, we highlight the need to develop a surveillance system to prevent the introduction and the spread of tick-borne pathogens in the Mediterranean Basin.

AB  - In this study we propose a model-building approach based on the hierarchical integration of the main environmental factors (climate, topography/lithology, and land uses) determining the distribution of the spur-thighed tortoise in south-east Spain. Data on the presence/absence of the species were primarily based on information derived from interviews to shepherds. The hierarchical modelling exercise consisted of three steps. First, we constructed a model for the entire region using climate variables, thus obtaining a potential climatical model. Second, we introduced variables referring to topography and lithology that fall within the climatic distribution range (potential model). Third, by using this second model as a starting point, we included land use variables to obtain the actual distribution model.
   We analysed the changes in the values of probability of the presence of this species for a given cell between the potential and the actual model, assessing areas where habitat quality has decreased, been maintained or increased. The spatial representation of these changes was highly coherent. A discriminant analysis linked areas where habitat quality has dropped with agriculture landscapes, whereas those areas where habitat quality has been maintained or increased were located mainly in shrublands. Twenty-five per cent (479 km(2)) of the potential distribution of the species became suboptimal when land use was included, which emphasizes the importance of land use changes in both the range dynamics and the conservation of the spur-thighed tortoise in south-east Spain.

AB  - The Spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, with small and fragmented populations located around the Mediterranean basin. In Turkey, this species has remained poorly studied which hampers solid assessment of threats and conservation measures. We studied the spatial distribution, habitat use, and demography of the species in the Gediz Delta (Aegean coast of Turkey) between 2015 and 2017 with a specific capture-mark-recapture survey made in the Sazligol marshes. A total of 114 individuals (20 juveniles, 62 males and 32 females) were captured and released in that period. Carapace length of adult females was on average higher (205.2 +/- 3.2 mm) than in adult males (190.9 +/- 2.3 mm). Sex ratio was biased with 1.94 males per female. Based on the capture-recapture histories of 65 individuals (3 juveniles, 37 males and 25 females) marked in 2015, we estimated the population size of the Sazligol marsh population to be 137 +/- 23 individuals, which corresponds to a density of 5.7 individuals per ha. The main threats detected were agricultural activities, urbanisation and captures for the pet trade.

AB  - Some species are very difficult to observe in the wild, and some of these present an apparently incongruent distribution, as is the case of the spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca in the southern Iberian Peninsula. This species has a discontinuous distribution with two main reproductive areas: one in the contiguous provinces of Almeria and Murcia, and the other in Huelva province. Both populations are thought to maintain reproductive isolation. However, we present new records obtained from two areas (the provinces of Malaga and Cadiz) which are outside their previously known range. Malaga province and Cadiz province are located between the two traditional reproductive areas. The new records were based on 16 interviews with shepherds as well as information provided by three naturalists. The aim of this work was to analyze the spatial distribution of areas favourable to the spur-thighed tortoise in the southern Iberian Peninsula, using different models with the same group of variables but with a different number of records: known records, new records and a combination of them. We obtained a distribution model for the species in Andalusia consistent with all observations, which was related to climatic stability, climatic disturbances, and spatial situation. This model presented three main favourable areas: two are coincident with the two known nuclei, and the other is situated in the southern part of the region, in the contiguous provinces of Cadiz and Malaga. We conclude that it is important to consider all the observations in the distribution models because records outside the traditional reproductive areas can include other environmental characteristics appropriate for the species.

AB  - Macroparasites in general, and ectoparasites in particular, have the potential to regulate host population dynamics. In this context, this study addresses the tick parasitism traits of the Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) in the core area of its distribution range (northwestern Morocco, Maamora). It was discovered that 92.5% of the tortoises were parasitized by ticks in spring, with an infestation intensity and an abundance of 6.7 and 6.2 tick/tortoise, respectively. The observed parasitization rates were among the highest reported worldwide for T. graeca, which could relate to density-depended effects driving host-parasite interactions. The main tick species that parasitized the tortoises were Hyalomma aegyptium (95.6% of the ticks and in the 100% of the parasitized tortoises), Hy. marginatum, Hy. excavatum and Hy. scupense. Individual predictors for the tortoises, such as age, sex and the interaction between body condition and sex, were significantly related to tick abundance. Age-related behavioural differences might favour a higher host-tick effective contact in adults than in juveniles. The fact that males are more active in spring - the breeding season - might explain the observed male-bias in tick abundance and may also be responsible for the negative effect of male body condition on tick infestation rate in contrast to females. Given the potential role played by parasites as regards modulating population dynamics, our results suggest that ticks should be taken into account in the conservation and management programmes of this tortoise species.

AB  - The diet of an Algerian population of spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) was studied with the aims of exploring: (i) the variation in diet among males, females and juveniles, (ii) the relationships between consumption and relative availability of the plant species, and (iii) which plant tissues, vegetative or reproductive, are eaten by tortoises. We recorded more than forty plant species at the study area, with monocot species (n = 7) having a greater percent cover than that of dicot species (n = 31 species) or Gymnospermae (n = 2). Tortoise diet was studied by categorising 4422 plant and animal fragments in faecal pellets of 20 males, 16 females and eight juveniles. Tortoises ate a wide variety of plant species, including 13 dicots and three monocots, and occasionally invertebrates. The number of fragments for a plant species was correlated with plant species cover, and plant vegetative tissues exceeded plant reproductive tissues in the faeces. Dicots (Fabaceae, Composeae, Primulaceae, and Caryophyllaceae) accounted for over 70% of the diet (faecal fragments). The high dietary (niche) overlap, and null model analysis (RA3 algorithm with 30,000 Monte Carlo simulations), indicate that males, females and juveniles did not partition fund resources; all three groups ate the same plant species.

AB  - The generic diagnosis of Thaparia Ortlepp, 1933, is emended based on the study and redescription of Thaparia thapari thapari (Dubinina, 1949) from the cecum of Testudo graeca Linnaeus, 1758, collected in Settat, Morocco. In addition, 2 new species, Thaparia carlosfeliui sp. n. and Thaparia bourgati sp. n. from the cecum of Testudo hermanni Gmelin, 1789, collected in Catalonia, Spain, are described. Scanning electron microscopy studies revealed substantial differences in the structure of the mouth and the caudal end, which enabled us to differentiate the 2 new species from the others and from each other.

AB  - A reduction in adult survival in long-living species may compromise population growth rates. The spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) is a long-lived reptile that is threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation. Golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), whose breeding habitats overlap that of tortoises, may predate them by dropping them onto rocks and breaking their carapaces. In SE Spain, the number of golden eagles has increased in the last decades and the abundance of their main prey (i.e., rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus) has decreased. Our aims were to 1) describe the role of tortoises in golden eagles' diet, and 2) estimate the predation impact of golden eagles on tortoises in eagles' territories and in the regional tortoise population. We collected regurgitated pellets and prey remains under eagle nests and roosts, and obtained information on tortoise abundance and population structure and rabbit abundance. We found that tortoises were an alternative prey to rabbits, so that eagles shifted to the former where the latter were scarce. The average predation rate on tortoises was very low at the two studied scales. However, eagles showed a marked selection for adult female tortoises, which led the tortoise sex ratio to be biased towards males in those eagle territories with higher tortoise predation. Whether this may compromise the spur-thighed tortoise long-term population viability locally deserves further attention.

AB  - Population fluctuations are driven by a combination of multiple factors, which can be classified into endogenous and exogenous. Endogenous factors are directly related to density-dependent forces, whereas exogenous factors are environmental drivers (e.g. climate). Several studies have reported the effects of endogenous and exogenous factors using exponential population models in mammals, birds or insects, but few works have explored the effects on reptiles, specifically in tortoises. In this study, we developed logistic population growth models to decipher the role of these factors on the population dynamics of the spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca. The role of environmental drivers in the distribution, movement, survival, reproduction or individual growth has been described for this species in previous works, but no studies have examined the effects of both endogenous and exogenous factors in population growth rates. Using long-term data of T. graeca in southeastern Iberian Peninsula (1999-2013), we fitted non-linear logistic models with endogenous and exogenous effects. The results showed that endogenous processes are important drivers of the population dynamics of this species, and that exogenous factors, such as freezing hours in winter, also directly affect the population growth rate. Intolerance of extreme winter temperatures may especially affect hatchlings and juvenile tortoises. Our models also showed that perturbations (i.e. a fire occurred during the monitoring period) have a lasting impact by reducing the carrying capacity of the population. This study shows that simple quantitative approaches based on population dynamic theory are useful for deciphering the ecological mechanisms underlying dynamics of tortoise populations.

AB  - We examined 210 spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) for the presence of ticks in Tunisia during May 2014. A total number of 602 adult ticks were collected and identified leading to the estimation of parasitological indicators. All the ticks belonged to a single species: Hyalomma aegyptium. The mean infestation prevalence was 66.2%, mean overall infestation intensity and abundance were 4.33 and 2.86 ticks/tortoise respectively. Our survey showed that tortoises were significantly more infested by male ticks than females (p < 0.001). The ticks were mainly present in the posterior limbs compared to other body regions (p < 0.05). There was no significance variation of length and weight of tortoises according to sex (p < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between the tortoises' size (length and weight) and tick infestation. This study showed high tick burdens of spur-thighed tortoises in Tunisia; further investigations are needed to determine exactly the role of this tick species in the transmission of different zoonotic pathogens.

AB  - Despite being one of the most charismatic elements of the Mediterranean Basin fauna and its threatened status, the western Mediterranean range of Testudo graeca is at present very poorly known. The present work provides the most detailed geographical and ecological description for the North African clade of T. graeca so far. We gathered 283 occurrence data of T. graeca in North Africa and modelled the distribution by means of presence-only distribution modelling tools. The obtained model was then projected to southern Europe in order to explore whether the environmental characteristics of European populations fall into the predicted niche of the species in North Africa.
   T. graeca showed a wide environmental range in North Africa. Presence localities ranged from the sea level to 2090 m of altitude and from 116 to 1093 mm of annual precipitation. The presence-only model indicates that distribution in North Africa is mainly related to rainfall, specifically rainfall values in the wettest and coldest quarter of the year. The distribution model showed a range of ca. 1 000 000 km(2). The projection of the model to southern Europe showed that the southern Iberian and Balkan Peninsulas, as well as most Mediterranean islands, present climatic conditions within those found in the range of the species in North Africa.

AB  - Recovery time from anesthesia can be extended in reptiles, consequently patients undergoing general anesthesia, require prolonged monitoring period which increases the probability of postoperative complications. Therefore, prolonged recovery time following inhalant anesthesia is a common complication in chelonians. Ability to intracardiac shunting and bypassing blood from pulmonary circulation, may contribute to their unpredictable inhalant anesthetic recovery times. The acupuncture point Governing vessel (GV-26) has been demonstrated to reduce anesthetic recovery times from inhalant anesthesia in many species. In this study eight spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo gracea) were anesthetized by isoflurane administration for 60 min. The trial was performed in two parts with four weeks washout period. In the first time, once isoflurane administration was discontinued, the tortoises received no therapy in the recovery period and in the second part of the study, tortoises received GV-26 electroacupuncture stimulation. Physiologic variables, anesthetic parameters, time to first movement and time to extubation were recorded. Data were compared with the use of independent sample t tests. Tortoises receiving GV-26 electroacupuncture had a significantly reduced time to return of voluntary movement (P<0.001), and a significantly reduced time to extubation (P<0.001). Furthermore, time from first movement to extubation was significantly shorter (P<0.05). Hence, the use of GV-26 electroacupuncture results in significant reduction of anesthetic recovery time in spur-thighed tortoises which have received inhalant anesthetic.

AB  - Wild populations of many species are declining as a result of habitat destruction and climate change but also through the over-collection for wild meat and the pet trade. With a long history of trade around the Mediterranean, populations of the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca graeca) have become highly disturbed. In this study we utilise a molecular approach to investigate the diversity, population admixture and structure of T. g. graeca populations in northern Africa and southern Spain, as well as to obtain an insight into the origin of newly established populations in the south of Europe. We infer this from the sequencing of two partial regions of the mitochondria (12s rRNA + cyt b) and genotyping at 16 microsatellite markers in 448 tortoises. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that Spanish populations were founded from North Africa, the consequence of multiple introductions or exchanges in genetic material as a result of trans-oceanic dispersal. Despite the trade of individuals between both sides of the Gibraltar Strait, our analysis of population structure showed clear differences between both the African and European populations, suggesting an incipient evolutionary lineage in southeast of Spain. As such, these populations possess unique genetic identities and should be treated as different management units. Surprisingly, the genetic data identified a great deal of diversity contained within pet (captive) stock and also allowed us to infer hybrids among individuals with another species of terrestrial tortoise from northern Spain (T. hermanni hermanni). Additionally, our results provide insight into the local movement and trade of individuals that has occurred around the Mediterranean basin (between northern Africa and southern Spain) and as such provides guidance for the effective management of T. g. graeca captive stock and the illegal trafficking.

AB  - A 2-year-old female, spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) was presented with poor body condition (1/5) and weakness. Fecal analysis revealed large numbers of oxyurid-like eggs, and radiographs were compatible with gastrointestinal obstruction. Despite supportive medical treatment, the animal died. At gross examination, an intestinal obstruction was confirmed. Histopathology revealed severe hyperplastic esophagitis and stomatitis with marked epithelial cytomegaly and enormous basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies. Electron microscopy examination revealed a large number of 60-80 nm, nonenveloped, icosahedral virions arranged in crystalline arrays within nuclear inclusions of esophageal epithelial cells, morphologically compatible with adenovirus-like particles. PCR for virus identification was performed with DNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. A nested, consensus pan-adenovirus PCR and sequencing analysis showed a novel adenovirus. According to phylogenetic calculations, it clustered to genus Atadenovirus in contrast with all other chelonian adenoviruses described to date. The present report details the pathologic findings associated with an adenovirus infection restricted to the upper digestive tract.

AB  - Terrestrial chelonians of arid regions are frequently faced with highly variable food quality and/or quantity and these problems could be aggravated in overgrazing areas. Then, it is crucial for species conservation to possess precise data on feeding ecology. In this paper, we provide the first quantitative data on Testudo graeca graeca feeding ecology, in the central Jbilets (Morocco). Diet composition was obtained by faecal analysis and compared to plant assemblages in the field. Interestingly, T. g. graeca seems rather a specialist herbivorous tortoise. The five main plant species found in faecal samples (Leontodon saxatilis (Asteraceae); Malva parviflora (Malvaceae); Astragalus cruciatus, Medicago hispida and Lotus arenarius (Fabaceae)) represent 70% of the identified material and are highly preferred whereas several other plant species, common in the field (e.g. Eryngium ilicifolium (Ombellifereae); Emex spinosus (Polygonaceae); Spergula flaccida Caryophyllaceae) are actively avoided. Fabaceae made up 27% of the diet and may be important forbs in the diet of terrestrial tortoise owing to their high nutritional value. The diet composition of T. g. graeca suggests that diet overlap may occur between domestic ungulates and tortoises in overgrazed landscape and could generate a competition context. However, T. g. graeca seems to focus its foraging effort under the spiny shrubs where the impact of overgrazing is strongly attenuated. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Armoured, rigid bodied animals, such as Testudines, must self-right should they find themselves in an inverted position. The ability to self-right is an essential biomechanical and physiological process that influences survival and ultimately fitness. Traits that enhance righting ability may consequently offer an evolutionary advantage. However, the energetic requirements of self-righting are unknown. Using respirometry and kinematic video analysis, we examined the metabolic cost of self-righting in the terrestrial Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise and compared this to the metabolic cost of locomotion at a moderate, easily sustainable speed. We found that self-righting is, relatively, metabolically expensive and costs around two times the mass-specific power required to walk. Rapid movements of the limbs and head facilitate successful righting however, combined with the constraints of breathing whilst upside down, contribute a significant metabolic cost. Consequently, in the wild, these animals should favour environments or behaviours where the risk of becoming inverted is reduced.

AB  - Much of our current knowledge about the genetic dynamics in range expansions originates from models, simulations and microcosm experiments that need to be corroborated by field data. Here, we report a neutral genetic pattern that matches the predictions of the genetic surfing theory. Genetic surfing occurs when repeated founding events and genetic drift act on the wave of advance of an expanding population, promoting strong spatial structure. In the range expansion of the tortoise Testudo graeca from North Africa to southeastern Spain, we found several genetic signatures consistent with surfing: a decrease of genetic diversity with distance from the initial founder area, clinal patterns in allele frequencies, rare African alleles which have become common at distal sites in the Spanish range, and stronger spatial differentiation in the expanded range than in the original one. Our results provide support for the theory that genetic drift can be an important force in shaping the genetic structure of expanding populations.

AB  - Aim Recent biogeographical studies have postulated a North African, Late Pleistocene, origin for some species of the Iberian Peninsula. However, a robust assessment of such range expansions requires high-resolution molecular tools to resolve overlapping biogeographical and cultural processes. Here we aim to determine whether the spur-thighed tortoise, Testudo graeca, arrived in south-eastern Spain during historical or prehistoric times, and whether its dispersal to the Iberian Peninsula was human-mediated. Location The western Mediterranean Basin (south-eastern Spain, northern Algeria and north-western Morocco). Methods Using 428 samples from 19 sites in North Africa and 18 in south-eastern Spain, we obtained mitochondrial sequences from the cytochrome b gene and genotypes derived from seven microsatellite loci. These data were employed to obtain population genetics descriptors, haplotype networks, Bayesian cluster analyses and isolation-by-distance patterns. Moreover, we used a Bayesian demographic approach to delimit the dates involved in the range expansion. Results We found lower levels of genetic variability and weak mitochondrial differentiation in the south-eastern Spanish tortoises compared with the North African ones. However, exclusive haplotypes occurred in the Iberian samples and microsatellite cluster analyses revealed moderate levels of admixture across both sides of the Mediterranean. A coastal area in the west of Algeria and the central-southern region in south-eastern Spain are suggested as the most probable founder and arrival places, respectively. Finally, we identified signatures of an ancient bottleneck event approximately 20,00030,000 years ago. Main conclusions The spur-thighed tortoise probably arrived in south-eastern Spain during Late Pleistocene sea-level low stands. The role that humans may have played as dispersers across the Mediterranean remains unclear. Our results are in accordance with other recent findings of trans-Mediterranean expansions during this period and highlight the importance of employing precise methodological approaches before a species can be considered as historically introduced.

AB  - Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) is actually included in the IUCN as vulnerable species. Its main European population is located in southeastern Spain. Although a great deal of information has been acquired on the internal medicine and survey and even parasitological fauna on these animals, there are no references about contaminants levels in this species. The objectives of this study were to compare the levels of two metals (cadmium and lead) in the blood of spur-thighed tortoises from two different populations, one from Southeastern of Spain (n = 22) and the other from North of Africa (n = 39), kept in captivity at the Santa Faz Recuperation Centre (Alicante, Spain) and to investigate the relationship between their blood levels of lead and their blood delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (delta-ALAD) activity. Blood lead and cadmium concentrations were higher in tortoises from African than in those from Spain. Moreover, a negative and significant correlation (P < 0.05) was found between delta-ALAD activity and blood lead levels, indicating the suitability of this enzyme as biomarker for lead in this species.

In tortoises, many studies have estimated individuals' age by counting growth rings on their scutes, assuming one ring per year (1:1 ratio). However, the accuracy of this method is controversial. The ring deposition pattern can vary depending on species, or even populations, and should be studied comprehensively. We studied the ring deposition pattern of Testudo graeca in southeastern Iberian Peninsula, using recaptures of 156 individuals between 2004 and 2010. We used a novel approach to explore the ring deposition pattern and to test possible differences between localities and individuals. Our results revealed that most analysed individuals (57.4%) showed a 1:1 ratio, in which rings were deposited during months of activity (spring to autumn). However, we found a trend to count less rings than years, which underestimated 1 year every 3 or 4 years. No differences in the deposition patterns were found among sites, sizes or sexes because the halt in growth during hibernation equally affects all tortoises in all sites. Our results support that the assumed 1:1 ratio in the assignment of individuals' age is too simplistic. Since ring deposition patterns are complex, the use of statistical approaches capable of handling deviations from the assumed deposition ratios can help to better depict population age structures.

AB  - In this study we report the sequence and phylogenetic characterization of an orthoreovirus strain, CH1197/96, isolated from a spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) on chicken embryo fibroblast cells. The 23,957 bp long genome sequence was obtained by combined use of semiconductor and capillary sequencing. Although the genomic characterization showed that the virus was most similar to the bush viper reovirus strain, 47/02, and in phylogenies performed with all segments the two strains formed a monophyletic group, the nucleotide (48.4-70.3%) and amino acid (39.2-80.7%) sequence identity values were moderate between the two reptile origin reoviruses. Based on our results and existing classification criteria for the genus Orthoreovirus, the tortoise reovirus strain CH1197/96 might be the first representative of a novel reptilian origin Orthoreovirus species.

AB  - Fires strongly influence the ecology of reptiles and have both direct and indirect effects on population dynamics as they affect life history traits. Here, we examine the effects of fire on individual growth patterns and on the survival rates of a tortoise Testudo graeca population in south-eastern Spain. We compare the biometric data from recaptures 4 years before and after a fire which burned 31 % of our study area. The von Bertalanffy and Gompertz growth models best describe the individual growth patterns for males and females. In males, but not females, fire significantly decreased the time required to reach their asymptotic size (k parameter). However, adult survival analyses reveal that the local survival rates lowered for both sexes after fire. Our work evidences that the effects of fire can be complex and maintained over time, affecting different life history traits.

AB  - A paternity test was used to investigate a robbery case involving captive individuals of Greek tortoise (Testudo graeca). Six tortoises were allegedly stolen from a private breeder and offered for sale on the web by the supposed thief. The stolen tortoises were confiscated by the rangers of the State Forestry Corps (CFS). A panel of 14 autosomal microsatellite loci was used to genotype the seized tortoises and ten individuals assumed to be legally owned by the breeder. Kinship analyses reliably reconstructed the tortoise pedigree, demonstrating parent-offspring relationships among the owned and the stolen tortoises. As correctly declared by the breeder, four of the six stolen individuals belonged to the same family group of the ten legally owned tortoises. Results indicate that genetic identification procedures can provide valuable evidence and give useful support against illegal wildlife traffic. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Studying phylogeographic histories in wide-ranging species provides key insights into those processes shaping current species' distributions and genetic structuring. In this work, we extend previous sampling and analyse data from three mitochondrial genes to explore in-depth the phylogeography of the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca), the most widely distributed of Western Palearctic tortoise species. The combination of loci with different evolutionary rates and new fossil data in molecular clock analyses allow us to infer a dual diversification burst of the species, which took place since the Mio-Pliocene for the eastern subspecies and during the Pleistocene for the subspecies distributed in North Africa. The latter seems to correspond to a more or less contemporary diversification burst, which resulted in the current west-east allopatric/parapatric distribution of the North African lineages. In addition to the previously known genetic lineages, a new one was discovered in Libya. Within a more recent framework, we use estimates of genetic diversity and demographic inferences from molecular data to address the origin of three extant Western European populations. The comparison of their current genetic signatures supports the recent introduction of T. graeca into Majorca and Sardinia and an ancient origin of the populations in south-eastern Spain. The fossil history of T. graeca supports our findings from the most comprehensive and unifying phylogeographic study conducted to date for T. graeca. Our work highlights T. graeca as a paradigmatic system for studying phylogeographic processes that act in very different temporal and geographical contexts.

AB  - Human behavior is an important factor in understanding the impact of exurban sprawl (i.e. low-density rural home development) on native species. We studied the long-term effect of pet collection on populations of the threatened spur-thighed tortoise by residents of exurban areas in southeastern Spain. We built a system dynamic model using authors' own data and bibliographic data about tortoise population dynamics, the housing development dynamics, and the behavior of local residents toward this species. The model includes two submodels (spur-thighed population dynamics and households dynamics) interconnected through a tortoise collection submodel. Simulations showed that exurban intensity (i.e. size of a housing development) is essential in determining the intensity and speed of tortoise population decrease. Populations may become extinct due to collection in areas around medium to large housing developments (above 650 houses). Low housing development causes a considerable reduction of original population levels (more than 14%). Environmental education program by itself, with the aim of reducing the willingness of new residents to keep tortoises in captivity, does not seem very effective. The quality and the speed with which the educational program is initialized are key factors in determining the effectiveness of the educational program. The scenarios simulation results suggest that the integration of policies of strong development constraints and educational programs are the most effective way in reducing the impact of exurban development on tortoise populations.

AB  - Simple Summary The trading and collection of wildlife for pets is one of the main threats for the conservation of some species worldwide. Assessing the human dimension of it is essential to improve our understanding of its drivers, which may help inform the design of effective species conservation strategies. We address this issue using the Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) as a case study. This species has sharply declined in its native range, tortoise trade and non-commercial collection for pets being some of the main threats. In fact, both uses have been documented in southern Europe and northern Africa, although this species has been protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) since 1975. Our study, which was based on a questionnaire survey, (i) demonstrated that many people in Rabat city (Morocco) and surroundings keep tortoises as pets (55%; n = 480), most of which had been collected directly from wild populations, and (ii) highlighted the limited ecological and biological knowledge of tortoise owners (mainly of those living in the city of Rabat) on the species. Our findings evidence how both the sociological context and the role of consumers/harvesters play a major part in this problem with international projection. We discussed deeply how tortoise non-commercial collection might affect its conservation and welfare, and recommended appropriate actions that focus on strengthening collection bans. The trading and collection of wild animals as pets may be cause for concern regarding animal welfare and species conservation. These concerns can be exemplified by Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca), a long-living species whose use as pets is long established. The human dimension plays a major role in the wildlife for the pet collection, and is particularly important in countries like Morocco, where this might pose a threat to the conservation of the species involved. This study, which is based on a questionnaire survey (n = 480 participants), documents the fact that many people in Morocco keep tortoises as pets: 55% of the participants in the survey and over two tortoises/person. Importantly, most captive tortoises, particularly juveniles, had been collected directly from wild populations by their owners (42%, n = 264). In general, the tortoise owners had limited knowledge of their tortoises' habits and requirements, although rural people were more likely to acknowledge that the tortoise is a wild and threatened species. Our study reveals that non-commercial collection is a common activity in Morocco that may threaten wild tortoise populations and hence species conservation, and it could have consequences regarding the welfare of the animals. We were also able to identify the profile of people towards whom education campaigns should be directed in order to reduce the number of tortoises collected from wild populations. Additional field research should also be conducted to quantify the impact of pet collection on wild tortoise populations.

AB  - The spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) is an endangered Mediterranean tortoise that lives in North Africa, Southern Europe and Southwest Asia. In the wake of recent legislation making their keeping as domestic animals illegal, many of these animals have been returned to wildlife recovery centers in Spain. In the present study, a population of such tortoises showing signs of ocular disease and nasal discharge was examined for the presence of Chlamydia spp. Cloacal, conjunctival and/or choanal swabs were collected from 58 animals. Using a real-time PCR specific for the family Chlamydiaceae, 57/58 animals tested positive in at least one sample. While only a few samples proved positive for C. pecorum, sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed a sequence identical to previously published sequences from specimens of German and Polish tortoises. Whole-genome sequences obtained from two conjunctival swab samples, as well as ANIb, TETRA values and a scheme based on 9 taxonomic marker genes revealed that the strain present in the Spanish tortoises represented a new yet non-classified species, with C. pecorum being its closest relative. We propose to designate the new species Candidatus Chlamydia testudinis. (C) 2020 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the present work we analyzed the genetic structure of the populations of the terrestrial tortoise Testudo graeca graeca in southeastern Spain, identified as a recent range expansion from North Africa. The study and interpretation of the species' genetic spatial pattern could provide clues to the processes related to the species' arrival and, because of its endangered status, is especially useful in implementing appropriate management measures. We used microsatellite markers to analyze 17 populations located in the coastal region of the species' range in southeastern Spain, and an external group of Algerian tortoises. Three genetic units with a high level of spatial coherence and moderate levels of admixture resulted from a cluster analysis, and an isolation-by-distance pattern covering the entire study area was detected. These results suggest that southeastern Spanish populations show a complex spatial genetic pattern resulting from their isolation from North African populations and their natural dispersal in this region. Finally, our work shows that conservation actions such as captive breeding, introductions or translocations, may have played a relevant role in the modification of the genetic structure of some populations in southeastern Spain. Therefore, these types of conservation measures should be carried out with more caution.

AB  - Tortoise ticks, Hyalomma aegyptium , are considered so strongly associated with their hosts that they are even used as indirect indicators for them. In such a case, a robust pattern of congruence between host and parasite could be expected, with phylogeographic breaks within the host being reflected in their parasites. We sequenced two mitochondrial partial gene regions (12S rRNA and Cytochrome Oxidase 1) from ticks across northern Africa and Anatolia, and compared patterns of variation with those identified in its main host, Testudo graeca. Two distinct haplogroups were identified, both of which were found distributed across much of northern Africa. This pattern does not reflect the known variation within the host, which has multiple, geographically disjunct subspecies in this region, but rather the major climatic zones. This relationship can be explained by adaptive processes to environmental conditions influenced by the climate, as well as by the spatial structure of the communities of tick potential hosts in larval and nymphal stages. Extensive anthropogenic movement of tortoises may also obscure congruence patterns between H. aegyptium ticks and their hosts.

AB  - The predation of young tortoise is considered a major cause of mortality for many tortoise species. The predation by common ravens has been identified as being responsible for significant decreases in tortoise populations. Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise hatchlings and juveniles in Maamora forest (Morocco) were studied in order to describe the size/age class predation of common ravens on young tortoises and infer the drivers of predation risk and population abundance. The results showed a high level of predation on young tortoises (<75mm carapace length) attributed to ravens in areas with low vegetation cover, representing 100% of the cases of mortality (n=147), but it was moderate in covered areas (n=19), representing 12-27%. The population structure of living juveniles differed significantly between covered and uncovered areas, thus suggesting that raven predation might modify juvenile population structure. Finally, N-mixture models showed a positive relationship between (i) bare cover and tortoise detectability that is only evidenced when the plot is far from a perch and (ii) population abundance and shrub species-richness, being higher in uncovered areas. Our results improve the knowledge on predation and survival on this critical stage in life, which is crucial for the conservation of the Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise.

AB  - The range dynamics of species distributed in temperate zones was significantly influenced by climatic fluctuations during the Pleistocene. However, little is known on how glacial and interglacial cycles affected the distribution of species occupying lower latitudes. The aim of this study was to assess Quaternary range dynamics of the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) in Iran and Transcaucasia and to infer how range fluctuations influenced the species' genetic diversity. We analysed mitochondrial DNA variation of samples from Iran and Transcaucasia and reconstructed the species' palaeogeography by projecting species distribution models (SDMs) onto palaeoclimatic conditions of the mid-Holocene (6000 BP) and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21 000 BP). We found three mitochondrial lineages in Iran, corresponding to the subspecies T. g. armeniaca, T. g. buxtoni and T. g. zarudnyi, whose current distribution is limited predominately by precipitation. A combination of SDMs and demographic analyses revealed that the ranges of these subspecies experienced only a slight shift during the Quaternary and did not expand significantly after the LGM. These results for T. graeca indicate that range dynamics of ectothermic taxa occupying lower latitudes in the western Palaearctic might be more complex and may not follow a simplistic scenario of glacial retraction and postglacial expansion.

AB  - The spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) is a terrestrial species in which multiple mating is frequently observed. We assessed the probability of multiple paternity in clutches (n = 15) laid by eight females, including successive clutches. Paternity was determined by microsatellite analyses at three loci. A large number of alleles per locus (n = 15-22) provided high probabilities of detecting multiple paternity, particularly at all loci combined (P = 0.989). Multiple paternity was found in 20% of the clutches in which offspring displayed more than two paternal alletes. However, this frequency may have been underestimated, given the small clutch sizes and the few loci used. Also, T graeca is able to store sperm from single or multiple matings and can use it to fertilize subsequent clutches of eggs, as indicated by the fact that the second clutch of a captive female was sired by a different male and that clutches of another female were multiply sired by the same males. These results confirm that multiple paternity exists in T graeca and that sperm storage in this species may be an important reproductive strategy to fertilize multiple clutches per year.

AB  - In the transition between Mediterranean forest and the arid subtropical shrublands of the southeastern Iberian Peninsula, humans have transformed habitat since ancient times. Understanding the role of the original mosaic landscapes in wildlife species and the effects of the current changes as pine forest plantations, performed even outside the forest ecological boundaries, are important conservation issues. We studied variation in the density of the endangered spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) in three areas that include the four most common land types within the species' range (pine forests, natural shrubs, dryland crop fields, and abandoned crop fields). Tortoise densities were estimated using a two-stage modeling approach with line transect distance sampling. Densities in dryland crop fields, abandoned crop fields and natural shrubs were higher (> 6 individuals/ha) than in pine forests (1.25 individuals/ha). We also found large variation in density in the pine forests. Recent pine plantations showed higher densities than mature pine forests where shrub and herbaceous cover was taller and thicker. We hypothesize that mature pine forest might constrain tortoise activity by acting as partial barriers to movements. This issue is relevant for management purposes given that large areas in the tortoise's range have recently been converted to pine plantations.

AB  - Wildlife translocations, the deliberate movement of animals from one part of their distribution to another, are increasingly used as a conservation method for the reestablishment of rare and endangered species. The objective of this study was to examine the movement patterns and macro- and microhabitat use of translocated and resident spur-thighed tortoises. This translocation was considered a soft-release as the tortoises were forced to be relatively inactive due to their being released at the beginning of the aestivation season. Our results suggest that forced aestivation soft-releases may succeed in reducing dispersal by forcing spur-thighed tortoises to spend time at the release site as the majority of translocated tortoises had similar activity range sizes and movement path tortuosity as resident tortoises. Spur-thighed tortoise conservation will require protecting habitat at multiple scales, with the remaining native forests in the country of Jordan being important to the spur-thighed tortoise during the activity and aestivation/hibernation seasons, as this macrohabitat was used significantly more than the human-modified habitats. Microhabitat structures such as leaf litter and availability of large stones may also be especially important in human-modified landscapes, as these microhabitats may help reduce the effects of habitat degradation.

AB  - An epidemic of chronic rhinitis in a population of 50 captive spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca graeca) from Palafrugell (Girona, Spain) is described, in which eight animals died and 12 were euthanatized to perform necropsies and post-mortem studies. The main clinical sign was a bilateral, seromucous rhinitis often accompanied by stomatitis and glossitis. Hematology and serum biochemistry were performed in 33 of the 50 ill animals and in 29 healthy tortoises from three disease-free populations. Lymphocyte count, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity, and alpha-globulin levels were significantly higher in the animals from the sick population. The heterophil count was significantly lower in the sick animals. Some of the diseased tortoises also showed a normocytic-normochromic anemia. Lesions were restricted to the respiratory system and oral cavity. Marked epithelial hyperplasia and presence of a severe mixed inflammatory infiltrate in the epithelium of the oral, nasal, and tracheal mucosae were observed. Electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of intracytoplasmic and intranuclear viral particles of the size, shape, and distribution pattern typical of a herpesvirus.

AB  - Clutch, egg and hatchling characteristics in the Souss Valley tortoises Testudo graeca soussensis (Testudinidae) from an arid steppe area of west-central Morocco were investigated in semi captivity in spring-early summer 2011. Mating activity occurs twice in the year, mainly in early spring and for a short period in mid-autumn. The egg laying period lasts from late May to early July. The mean clutch size, based on the first clutches, is 3.44 +/- 1.33 eggs per clutch (range: 1-5 eggs); the eggs are elongated in shape. The mean relative egg mass and relative clutch mass are 1.70 +/- 0.28% and 4.06 +/- 1.32%, respectively. No egg variable was significantly correlated with the female body size (carapace length and body weight). The mean incubation duration of artificially incubated eggs (at 31 degrees C) is 70 +/- 5.7 days. The body mass at hatching is 12.8 +/- 0.6 g. The carapace is sub-circular and more domed than that of adults. The obtained data are compared to those reported for other populations and subspecies of T. graeca across its distribution range. The present study would, hopefully, help to assess the potential for tortoise captive breeding in the eco-climatic conditions of Marrakech, west-central Morocco, for the reinforcement of local declining populations.

AB  - The study of the movement of individuals directly informs about home-range sizes, migratory routes or habitat selection. But also, integrating movement into ecological models allows for larger-scale studies. Here we summarize the results of our line of research based in the individual-based model STEPLAND. The model was parameterized with movement, demographic and genetic data of spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) in SE Spain. We developed different simulation experiments to answer questions about the effects of global change on the conservation of this species. At the species level, we identified those evolutionary traits of tortoises, such as female sperm storage, that prevent extinctions in human-altered habitats. At landscape scale, we assessed the impact of agricultural abandonment and agricultural intensification on the population dynamics of this long-lived species. Only agricultural intensification negatively affected reproductive rates, population density, and probability of extinction of T. graeca, with time-lag responses of 20, 30 and 130 years respectively. Finally, in a regional context, we aim to simulate the early stages of a range expansion. Preliminary results reveal patterns compatible to "genetic surfing", a process affecting the expansion of low dispersal species impacted by strong ge-netic drift. We believe that our line of research exemplifies well that the scientific value of movement data goes well beyond the individual level.

AB  - The spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca ibera Pallas, 1814 is a good example of a vulnerable long-lived CITES species, which is widely bred as a pet and can be easily reproduced in captivity. However, the high number of bred tortoises makes it difficult to monitor the international pet trade. Despite microchipping being widely recommended as an identification method, it is unsuitable for hatchlings and young tortoises because implanting the chip in chelonians can sometimes cause health problems. We believe that these disadvantages can be resolved by plastron photo documentation but this method is still not considered a valid alternative. The objective of this study was to find a method for identifying a specimen from a photograph database using morphometrics, an approach potentially more reliable than other fingerprinting methods currently used for tortoises. We propose a combined dissimilarity measure calculated from the relative differences in seam distances between two plastron photographs. The reliability of identification is studied on a dataset of 90 spur-thighed tortoises, 20 of which were photographed at ages two, eight, 14 and 20 months. We achieved a reliability of 99.3-99.9% in identifying time-lagged photographs of the same individual against photographs of unrelated individuals, and 97.5-99.8% in identifying time-lagged photographs against photographs of siblings. We conclude that a properly taken plastron photograph of Testudo graeca enables precise identification during the first years of ontogenetic development.

AB  - Using mtDNA sequences and 12 microsatellite loci, we compare populations of Testudo graeca from Sardinia and North Africa. The observed pattern of almost no differentiation combined with reduced variation in the Sardinian population is consistent with introduction in prehistoric or historic times from what is now Tunisia and neighbouring Algeria. Furthermore, in the light of the recently published recommendation to eradicate the non-native T. graeca from Italy, we review recent studies on the archaeological and fossil record, on the phylogeography and population genetics of the three other chelonian species occurring in Sardinia (Emys orbicularis, T. hermanni, T. marginata). We conclude that the extant Sardinian populations of all four species are not native. However, they are and should be safeguarded under EC law (Council Regulation No 338/97 on the Protection of Species of Wild Fauna and Flora; Flora Fauna Habitat Directive: Appendix IV, Art. 12) because they serve as a back-up for the declining mainland populations. Moreover, these populations constitute an important part of the human-shaped natural heritage of the Mediterranean.

AB  - Arid Mediterranean regions that shelter unique biodiversity are threatened by increasing anthropogenic pressures, such as urbanization, overgrazing and climate change. In Morocco, one of the main bush species in arid areas, the jujube (Ziziphus lotus), suffers from officially promoted programmes of removal. The Moorish tortoise (Testudo graeca soussensis) is threatened by such habitat loss. Like most animals, the Moorish tortoise must navigate between microhabitats to find essential feeding resources and thermal refuges. This study combined radio-tracking of free-ranging individuals, microhabitat temperature monitoring and transects in a range of habitats. Tortoises were found to depend on the occurrence of large and relatively abundant bushes to escape lethal overheating. Thus, (1) current official encouragements for the destruction of the jujube bushes should be reappraised; (2) habitat restoration relying on replanting jujube bush should be encouraged; and (3) large-scale monitoring of critical bush densities should be used to better organize conservation plans (protection and/or restoration of areas) for the Moorish tortoise.

AB  - Considerable attention has been given lately to the effects of habitat fragmentation and destruction on wildlife. Here, we summarize their effects on animal abundance and plant cover during a three-year study period (1987-90) of the sand dunes of the coastal plain of Israel. Populations of the gray monitor Varanus griseus, the spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca, and the mountain gazelle Gazella gazella in the study area declined markedly and plant cover increased significantly. Habitat destruction and fragmentation, introduced animals (especially dogs and carrion crows), a continuing change in the native herbivore fauna, and blockage of wind-borne sand are all believed to be responsible for the observed changes. We recommend that small areas, unsuitable for full protection, be declared ''city reserves,'' to be used for educational and recreational purposes. Nature reserves need to be managed in order to maintain the existing fauna and flora.

AB  - Hatching success, egg incubation, emergence and hatchling characteristics were assessed for 44 naturally incubating nests of Testudo graeca in south-western Spain. Nest predation rate was 4.5% and overall hatching success was 82.4%. Incubation periods ranged from 78 to 114 days, and hatchlings delayed emergence from the nest from one to 23 days. Emergences occurred from mid August to late September, and were not correlated with nesting dates, but earlier laid nests had longer incubation times, which was probably owing to lower temperatures experienced by clutches laid at the beginning of the nesting season. Variance of hatchling body size and mass was high and was mainly influenced by the gravid female. Mean straight carapace length was 34.14 mm, and mean body mass 10.8 g. Hatchlings from clutches laid last in the nesting season had significantly better physical condition. Hatchling mass was positively correlated with egg mass, and both Variables were positively correlated with emergence date. Both better physical condition and relatively late emergence may confer advantages to hatchlings in the face of unfavourable environmental conditions in autumn.

AB  - The dissemination of vector arthropods harbouring zoonotic pathogens through the uncontrolled transboundary trade of exotic and pet animals poses an important threat to Public Health. In the present report, we describe the introduction of pathogenic Rickettsia africae and R. aeschlimanni in ticks removed from imported tortoises in Qatar. A total of 21 ticks were collected from pet spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) from Doha, May 2018, and studied for species identification and characterization of Rickettsia spp. Morphological and molecular analysis of ticks allowed their identification as Hyalomma aegyptium. Molecular analysis of partial ompA and gltA genes showed that Rickettsia sequences found on these ticks clustered with sequences classified as R. aeschilimanii and R. africae. Since pre-adult stages of H. aegyptium also feed on humans, this tick species may play a role in the transmission of R. aeschilimanii and R. africae. We alert for the introduction of non-native pets as vehicles for tick importation, known vectors for animal and human pathogenic agents. Importation of exotic species into non-autochthonous countries deserves strict control to enforce robust surveillance and mitigate potential exotic diseases epidemics.

Particularly at south-eastern Spain, the species is mainly threatened by habitat destruction and over-collection, given that this chelonian has been traditionally considered an appreciate pet. As south-eastern Spanish wildlife recovery centers shelter hundreds of captive animals mainly coming from illegal trade or captive-bred, there is a strong debate about what to do with these animals: maintaining them in captivity all along their lives or reintroducing them to wildlife. It is well known that the reintroduction of captive animals supposes a risk for the wild population due to the uncertainty of their genetic origin and to the possible spread of infectious diseases. However, despite the increasing evidence that infectious agents are a potential health hazard for wildlife, little is known about the risk that introduced parasites could suppose for the wild populations of spur-thighed tortoise.
   The present study investigates for the first time the presence of helminth eggs and worms in faeces from 107 wild and captive individuals collected from mid-March to mid-June 2010, and relates the findings to different environmental and host variables. Sixteen oxyurid species and the ascarid Angusticaecum holopterum were identified. This last nematode and the oxyurid species Tachygonetria palearticus and T. seurati had not been reported in Spanish wild T. graeca previously. The prevalence of oxyurid eggs and worms were 94% and 70%, respectively; while, ascarid eggs and worms were found in 26% and 5% of tortoises, respectively. Ascarid infections affected mostly captive animals and were associated to caparace deformities and symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease (p < 0.05). Oxyurid infections were not associated to negative health traits and prevalence increased with age. In free-living tortoises, the distribution of pharingodonid genera also varied according to habitat; moreover, T. longicollis, T. pusilla, conica, T. robusta and Mehdiella stylosa where significantly more frequent in wild compared to captive tortoises (p < 0.05). Study results highlight important differences in the nematode fauna of captive and free-living tortoises and questions one more time if the reintroductions of captive animals suppose a risk for the wild population since the former ones can harbor and distribute among free populations pathogens like ascarid nematodes.

AB  - Animal movement and behavior may respond to habitat modification or fragmentation in non trivial ways, thereby strongly conditioning the fate of populations. This study aims to understand movement patterns of non-dispersal animals in both natural and altered landscapes, using the endangered terrestrial tortoise Testudo graeca as example. We used individual-based simulation models representing competing hypotheses on tortoise movement. Model parameterization and selection was based on radiotracking data and an inverse approach that is able to deal with observation uncertainty, individual variability, and process stochasticity. We find that land use intensification had a strong impact on the movement and behavior of non-dispersing individuals of T. graeca. In natural landscapes, males and females showed a similar movement and behavior profile with a strong home behavior component, and little individual variability. However, in altered landscapes, movement and behavior greatly varied among individuals, particularly in females, and males and females showed different movement patterns. Females showed a wide range of movement patterns, from strong home behavior to an unbounded movement. Our study shows that population or movement models that assume single behavioral states for animals inhabiting different landscape structures can be strongly misleading and, furthermore, that the impact of landscape modification on movement and behavioral patterns can be strongly sex-biased. Flexible, individual-based movement models coupled with inverse parameterization and model selection approaches proved useful in understanding the mechanisms controlling animal movement patterns.

AB  - Infestation by ticks affects several vertebrate groups, including tortoises. Testudo species are among chelonian fauna that are infested in their natural habitat by several tick species, with Hyalomma aegyptium as the dominant one. We report a heavy tick infestation found in female T. graeca in May 2018 in Had Draa (Essaouira region, Morocco). The female, with carapace length of 175 mm and body weight of 779.3 g was found to be infested by 288 H. aegyptium in different stages. It was more infested by female ticks than males, and the hind limbs (59.6%) and forelimbs (30.25%) were the most frequent predilection sites of ticks. Our data provide the first record of massive parasitism by H. aegyptium in this vulnerable and threatened tortoise.

AB  - We assessed the dynamics of a population of spur-thighed tortoises, Testudo graeca, placed under long-term protection from human interference, We estimated demographic parameters and constructed vertical life tables based on age structures for two different study periods separated by a 12-yr interval. Average age at maturity was 6.9 yr for males and 8.5 yr for females. Clutch size varied with female size, but tended to be constant among years. Average annual female fecundity over 9 yr was 8.4 eggs and decreased significantly in years of high rainfall. Females seemed to reproduce yearly, but with a constantly low output, probably maximising both their long-term reproductive potential and the probability of producing offspring during favourable years for hatchling survival. Adult survival was high and constant between periods. Juvenile survivorship from egg to 6 yr and recruitment into the 5-8-yr-old cohorts were significantly higher in the second period. Life tables indicated a predominantly negative demographic trend for the first period, with an average population increase rate of 0.977, and an overall positive tendency for the second period, with an average increase rate of 1.091. These figures suggest that the population experienced a variation that was closer to the maximum estimates for the first period. mediated mainly by an increase in juvenile recruitment. The data indicate that, besides high adult survival rates, occasional high juvenile recruitment bouts may have an important regulatory effect on the population dynamics of Testudo graeca.

AB  - Ticks carry a diverse community of microorganisms including non-pathogenic symbionts, commensals, and pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, protozoans, and fungi. The assessment of tick-borne microorganisms (TBM) in tortoises and their ticks is essential to understand their eco-epidemiology, and to map and monitor potential pathogens to humans and other animals. The aim of this study was to characterize the diversity of microorganisms found in ticks collected from the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) in North Africa and Anatolia. Ticks feeding on wild T. graeca were collected, and pathogens were screened by polymerase chain reaction using group-specific primers. In total, 131 adult Hyalomma aegyptium ticks were collected from 92 T. graeca in Morocco (n = 48), Tunisia (n = 2), Algeria (n = 70), and Turkey (n = 11). Bacteria and protozoa detected included Hemolivia mauritanica (22.9%), Midichloria mitochondrii (11.4%), relapsing-fever borreliae (8.4%), Ehrlichia spp. (7.6%), Rickettsia spp. (3.4%), Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. (0.9%), Francisella spp. (0.9%), and Wolbachia spp. (0.8%). The characterization of Rickettsia included R. sibirica mongolitimonae (Algeria), R. aeschlimannii (Turkey), and R.africae (Morocco). Hemolivia mauritanica and Ehrlichia spp. prevalence varied significantly with the sampling region/country. We did not detect significant associations in microorganism presence within ticks, nor between microorganism presence and tick mitochondrial DNA haplogroups. This is the first report of Francisella persica-like, relapsing fever borreliae, M. mitochondrii, and Wolbachia spp. in H. aegyptium ticks collected from wild hosts from the South and Eastern Mediterranean region, and of R. sibirica mongolitimonae and R. africae in H. aegyptium from Algeria and Morocco, respectively. Given that T. graeca is a common species in commercial and non-commercial pet trade, the evaluation of the role of this species and its ticks as hosts for TBM is particularly relevant for public health.

AB  - Hyalomma aegyptium (Linnaeus, 1758) is a hard-tick species of the Ixodidae family with the main adult hosts being Palearctic tortoises of the genus Testudo. In Morocco, it is commonly found infecting Testudo graeca that has a wide geographic distribution and is subject to protection through international illegal trade legislation. This tortoise tick has been reported as an important vector of various human and animal pathogens. Unfortunately, to date, there are no strategies to control this hematophagous ectoparasite. The present study was conducted in laboratory to evaluate the acaricidal activity of essential oils (EOs) extracted from six plants of Moroccan origin as an alternative against H. aegyptium. All EOs tested displayed toxic effects on different life stages of H. aegyptium. Mentha suaveolens subsp. timija (LC50=0.910 mu L/mL and LC90=1.465 mu L/mL) and Satureja calamintha EOs (LC50=0.927 mu L/mL and LC90=1.347 mu L/mL) exhibited higher activity against hatching eggs, whereas Chenopodium ambrosioides EO was comparatively more toxic to larvae (LC50=0.444 mu L/mL and LC90=0.918 mu L/mL). Juniperus thurifera var. africana (LC50=0.0045mL/cm(2) and LC90=0.0118mL/cm(2)) and Lavandula pedunculata subsp. atlantica EOs (LC50=0.0036mL/cm(2) and LC90=0.0110mL/cm(2)) caused high mortality in nymphs. The effect of different EOs is discussed according to their chemical composition and bioactive components.

AB  - Background. Tortoises of the genus Testudo are widely distributed throughout the Mediterranean region and southwestern Asia. However, the evolutionary mechanisms of diversification in this genus are still poorly understood. Methods. In this study, we assessed the evolutionary patterns in the climate niches of five species and 11 subspecies of the genus Testudo using ecological niche models and evaluated the niche overlap based on species phylogenetic distances. Results. The ecological models indicated that most species differ in their climate niches, but show overlap, with gradual transitions at range boundaries. As expected, the ecological divergence among subspecies was lower than that among species. Evaluation of the phylogenetic signal indicated that climate niches have been weakly conserved, but sister species also show high evolutionary divergence.

AB  - The use of local ecological knowledge (LEK) has been advocated for biodiversity monitoring and management. To date, however, it has been underused in studying wild populations of animals and, particularly, in obtaining quantitative abundance estimates. We evaluated LEK as a tool for collecting extensive data on local animal abundance and population trends. We interviewed shepherds in southeastern Spain, asking them to estimate the local abundance of the terrestrial tortoise Testudo graeca. We quantified reliability of abundance estimates derived from interviews by comparing them with those obtained from standard field-sampling protocols (distance sampling). We also explored the complementarity of these 2 approaches. LEK provided high-quality and low-cost information about both distribution and abundance of T. graeca. Interviews with shepherds yielded abundance estimates in a much wider range than linear transects, which only detected the species in the upper two-thirds of its abundance range. Abundance estimates from both methodologies showed a close relationship. Analysis of confidence intervals indicated local knowledge could be used to estimate mean local abundances and to detect mean population trends. A cost analysis determined that the information derived from LEK was 100 times cheaper than that obtained through linear-transect surveys. Our results should further the use of LEK as a standard tool for sampling the quantitative abundance of a great variety of taxa, particularly when population densities are low and traditional sampling methods are expensive or difficult to implement.

AB  - Chelonid herpesvirus (ChHV) and mycoplasmal infections cause similar clinical signs in terrestrial tortoises and may be the most important causative agents of rhinitis-stomatitis complex, a common disease in captive tortoises worldwide. Currently, diagnosis of ChHV and Mycoplasma spp. infections is most often based on serologic testing. However, serologic results only detect past exposure, and the specificity of these tests can be reduced due to antigenic cross-reactions with other pathogens. Molecular-based techniques could help to define the causative agent and to better manage infected tortoises. Using polymerase chain reaction, we analyzed 63 tortoises (59 spur-thighed tortoise, Testudo graeca; three Creek tortoise, Testudo ibera; and one Russian tortoise, Agryonemys horsfieldii) with clinical signs of rhinitis-stomatitis complex to identify the causative agent. Molecular evidence of ChHV type T (24%), type II (3%), and Mycoplasma agassizii (6%) infections, as well as coinfection of Mycoplasma-ChHV and both types of ChHV, were detected. Both ChHV and M. agassizii are considered pathogenic in captive tortoises and both are a threat to wild populations. However, neither agent was detected from most of the symptomatic tortoises we evaluated, indicating that other agents could be involved in the rhinitis-stomatitis complex.

AB  - Survival is a key parameter in species' management and conservation. Most methods for estimating survival require time series data, large sample sizes and, overall, costly monitoring efforts. Inverse modeling approaches can be less data hungry, however they are underused in conservation sciences. Here we present an inverse modeling approach for estimating relative survival rates of long-lived species that is mathematically straightforward and evaluate its performance under constraints common in conservation studies related to small sample sizes. Specifically, we (i) estimated the relative survival rates in a Testudo graeca population based on one-year monitoring, (ii) assessed the impact of sample size on the accuracy, and (iii) tested alternative hypotheses on the impact of fire on the survival rates. We then compared the results of our approach with capture-recapture (CRC) estimates based on long-term monitoring. Our approach (153 individuals within a single year) yielded estimates of survival rates overlapping those of CRC estimates (11 years of data and 1009 individuals) for adults and subadults, but not for juveniles. Simulation experiments showed that our method provides robust estimates if sample size is above 100 individuals. The best models describing the impact of fire on survival identified by our approach predicts a decrease in survival especially in hatchlings and juvenile individuals, similar to CRC estimates. Our work proves that inverse modeling can decrease the cost for estimating demographic rates, especially for long-lived species and as such, its use should be encouraged in conservation and management sciences.

AB  - During spring 2018, we captured 101 spur-thighed tortoises,Testudo graeca,from seven localities in central Morocco. All tortoises were examined for the presence of blood parasitesHemolivia mauritanicaandHyalomma aegyptiumticks, the known vectors. We looked forH. mauritanicainfection by examination of blood smears and by genetic analysis with PCR using extractions from both tortoises and ticks. On all tortoises collected, 71.29% were infested with at least one tick, with a mean infestation intensity of 7.12 ticks/tortoise and maximum of 15.55 ticks/tortoises in Had Draa locality (Essaouira region). Although the definitive host is present and abundant in all tortoise populations, all blood samples wereHemolivia-negative. Our results support and confirm the finding of studies previously conducted in other populations of Morocco and indicate thatH. mauritanicahas a narrower distribution range than its tick vector.

AB  - Mate searching is a key component of sexual reproduction that can have important implications for population viability, especially for the mate-finding Allee effect. Interannual sperm storage by females may be an adaptation that potentially attenuates mate limitation, but the demographic consequences of this functional trait have not been studied. Our goal is to assess the effect of female sperm storage durability on the strength of the mate-finding Allee effect and the viability of populations subject to low population density and habitat alteration. We used an individual-based simulation model that incorporates realistic representations of the demographic and spatial processes of our model species, the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca). This allowed for a detailed assessment of reproductive rates, population growth rates, and extinction probabilities. We also studied the relationship between the number of reproductive males and the reproductive rates for scenarios combining different levels of sperm storage durability, initial population density, and landscape alteration. Our results showed that simulated populations parameterized with the field-observed demographic rates collapsed for short sperm storage durability, but were viable for a durability of one year or longer. In contrast, the simulated populations with a low initial density were only viable in human-altered landscapes for sperm storage durability of 4 years. We find that sperm storage is an effective mechanism that can reduce the strength of the mate-finding Allee effect and contribute to the persistence of low-density populations. Our study highlights the key role of sperm storage in the dynamics of species with limited movement ability to facilitate reproduction in patchy landscapes or during population expansion. This study represents the first quantification of the effect of sperm storage durability on population dynamics in different landscapes and population scenarios.

AB  - Context. Understanding how people view, think and talk about wildlife and the link between wildlife and human behaviour are important for wildlife management to be effective. In this paper, we used the notion of social representations to understand people's behaviour towards wildlife. We qualitatively studied social representations relating to the keeping in captivity of the endangered tortoise Testudo graeca in south-east Spain.
   Aims. The aims were to elucidate social representations towards the spur-thighed tortoise, and to understand the link between social representation and the motivations for collecting and keeping tortoises in captivity. We discuss the conservation implications of social representation towards this tortoise species and provide some management recommendations.
   Methods. We carried out 13 in-depth interviews with rural-agrarian, urban and neorural dwellers who kept tortoises in captivity to elucidate social representations towards the spur-thighed tortoise and to understand the link between social representation and the motivations for collecting and keeping tortoises.
   Key results. The discourse analysis shows that the social representations of this tortoise as a tameable animal, pet and safeguarded animal co-exist in south-east Spain.
   Conclusions. The fact that the social reality in south-east Spain has changed from a social-agrarian society to an urban and neorural society seems to explain these social representations. The conservationist discourse espoused by some respondents partly explains why the habit of keeping tortoises in captivity has prevailed despite social changes in recent decades and this activity being prohibited since the 1970s.
   Implications. Our findings reveal the utility of the social representation notion in understanding the social dimensions of wildlife conservation and its applicability to wildlife management.

AB  - Simple Summary
   A central goal of life history studies is documenting traits related to reproduction. In long-lived species, older individuals might have traits that enhance reproductive success. However, survivorship at young life stages is usually unknown, which blurs the basic understanding of how female traits influence recruitment and the relevance of climate variation. Our study, which was based on the spur-thighed tortoise, demonstrated that (i) maternal age and climatic conditions influence the recruitment, (ii) older females have greater offspring numbers, greater survival and smaller size and mass than younger females and (iii) severe climatic conditions-low rainfall and temperature-reduce the number of surviving offspring despite their increased size. We discuss deeply how the maternal age and climatic conditions might affect population dynamics of long-lived species and recommended long-term studies of reproductive parameters and appropriate conservation actions.
   Long-lived species are particularly interesting for investigation of trade-offs that shape reproductive allocation and the effective contribution to the next generations. Life history theory predicts that these species will buffer environmental stochasticity via changes in the reproductive investment, while maintaining high adult survival rates. The spur-thighed tortoise was selected as a case study in order to investigate the relationship between the linked maternal characteristics (size and age) and related traits in their hatchlings. We tracked naturally emerging hatchlings from young and old females under semi-natural conditions to test variations in hatchling numbers, body mass, size and survival over two years. We used linear mixed-effect models to analyze variations in hatchling body mass and size, and a mark-release-recapture framework to model their survival. Our study illustrates that old females of long-lived species have greater offspring numbers, greater survival and smaller size when compared with those of young females. The interannual variability evidenced the reduced offspring number and survival in the lower autumn rainfall and spring mean temperature year. Our results highlight the role of maternal age and climatic conditions in the population dynamics and the need for long-term studies of reproduction traits for designating adequate conservation strategies.

AB  - Using 10 polymorphic microsatellite loci and sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, we examine gene flow in more than 100 spur-thighed tortoises from Transcaucasia and compare our findings with previously published AFLP and mtDNA data. While mtDNA sequences correspond to three deeply divergent clades and AFLP data suggest two distinct groups, microsatellite data indicate weak differentiation and extensive gene flow. We conclude that each marker system reflects a distinct episode in the evolutionary history of the Testudo graeca complex, corresponding to phases of vicariance and extensive gene flow. We hypothesize that the reciprocally monophyletic and deeply divergent mtDNA lineages reflect old vicariance events, while the conflicting nuclear markers are the legacy of younger episodes of extensive gene flow. The differentiation pattern found in the AFLP markers, with AFLP groups matching allopatrically or parapatrically distributed mitochondrial lineages, is likely to be older than the microsatellite differentiation, which could correspond to Holocene range expansions into Caucasian valleys and lower altitudes. Owing to the largely mutually exclusive distribution ranges of the deeply divergent mtDNA lineages, their identification with distinct subspecies is a reasonable and straightforward classification that facilitates communication and acknowledges the conspecifity of the involved evolutionary units. Consequently, Transcaucasia constitutes an intergradation zone of T. g. armeniaca, T. g. buxtoni and T. g. ibera.

AB  - Hyalomma aegyptium (Linnaeus, 1758) (Ixodida: Ixodidae) has recently been confirmed as a carrier of numerous pathogenic, including zoonotic, agents. Four environmentally distinct regions of Algeria, located between the humid coastal zone and the arid Saharan Atlas range, were selected in order to compare differences in tick abundance among localities, and the correlations between tick abundance and host population characteristics and other environmental conditions. Sampling was carried out during May and early June in 2010-2012. A total of 1832 H. aegyptium were removed from 201 tortoises. Adult ticks accounted for 52% of the collection. In the pre-adult stages, larvae were dominant. Data on prevalence, intensity (mean +/- standard deviation, range) and abundance of tick infestation were calculated for each locality. Locally, prevalences reached 100%. The sex ratio was biased in favour of males (4.2). Intensities of infestation differed significantly among the localities studied for all developmental stages of the tick. The intensity of infestation by adult ticks was positively correlated to the size of the tortoise and with tortoise population density in the habitat. However, findings for immature tick stages were independent of both variables. No significant correlations between infestation intensities and the climatic parameters tested were found. Immature ticks were observed to prefer the front parts of their tortoise hosts, whereas the majority of adults were attached to the rear parts.

AB  - Body size is an ecologically important variable in animals. The geographical size variation of most snakes and some lizards counters Bergmann's rule in that, among related taxa, the larger ones live at warmer latitudes. However, exceptions notwithstanding, and despite being ectothermic, turtles as a group tend to obey Bergmann's rule. We examined this idea in Testudo graeca, ranging from Morocco to Romania and to Iran with disputed systematics, both at the global scale (using literature) and within the focal area of Israel (using museum specimens). Both globally and locally, carapace length correlated with latitude, in accordance with Bergmann's rule. The scant data on reproduction fully support the hypothesis that Bergmann's rule enables larger clutches where the climate would limit repeated clutches. The sexual size dimorphism (SSD) was approached using two methodologies: (1) conventional', using globally literature data and locally museum samples and (2) innovated', using photographs of copulating tortoises from Israel and Turkey. By each methodology, SSD emerged as being male biased in the larger-bodied populations and female biased in the smaller-bodied populations, obeying Rensch's rule. Some observations support the hypothesis that the evolution of large males serves intermale combating. Finally, Rensch's rule was found to apply separately within Anatolia and within the Levant, possibly indicating that these populations are separate.

AB  - Animal populations have developed multiple strategies to deal with environmental change. Among them, the demographic buffering strategy consists in constraining the temporal variation of the vital rate(s) that most affect(s) the overall performance of the population. Tortoises are known to buffer their temporal variation in adult survival, which typically has the highest contribution to the population growth rate lambda, at the expense of a high variability on reproductive rates, which contribute far less to lambda. To identify the effects of projected increases in droughts in its natural habitat, we use field data collected across 15 locations of Testudo graeca in southeast Spain over a decade. We analyse the effects of environmental variables on reproduction rates. In addition, we couple the demographic and environmental data to parameterise an integral projection model to simulate the effects of different scenarios of drought recurrence on lambda under different degrees of intensity in the survival-reproduction tradeoff. We find that droughts negatively affect the probability of laying eggs; however, the overall effects on lambda under the current drought recurrence (one/decade) are negligible when survival is constant (independent of the reduction of reproduction by drought events) and when survival increased as a tradeoff with the reduction of reproduction rates, with a threshold to population viability at three or more droughts/decade. Additionally, we show that, although some species may buffer current environmental regimes by carefully orchestrating how their vital rates vary through time, a demographic buffering strategy is insufficient to ensure population viability in extreme regimes. Our findings support the hypothesis that the demographic buffering strategy has a limit of effectiveness when adverse conditions occur frequently. Our methodological approach provides a framework for ecologists to determine how effective the management of environmental drivers can be for demographically buffering populations, and which scenarios may not provide long-term population persistence.

AB  - The pre-copulatory behavior of the Mediterranean Spur-thighed Tortoise (Testudo graeca), especially the means by which males and females find each other in the breeding season, has been poorly addressed. We conducted behavioral experiments to investigate the pre-copulatory behavior of sexually matureT. graecamales and females under semi-natural and restrictive captive conditions. We found that when females were kept under constraining captive conditions, they were no longer approached by males during the breeding season. However, when the females were under semi-natural conditions during the breeding season, males displayed significantly more sniffing, patrolling, and climbing events toward the opposite sex. Moreover, males, that were located inside an enclosure where they could move freely toward surrounding conspecifics, which they could not see, showed a clear preference for the female side of the enclosure. During the non-breeding season, none of these behaviors were displayed. It seems that the mating season begins with males sensing, most likely through a chemo-orientation, the location of females but not vice versa. We suggest that restrictive captivity in females could lead to suppressed reproductive behavior in both sexes, including the pre-copulatory searching behavior that males normally exhibit in the wild. This study presents novel information on the pre-copulatory behaviors of this vulnerable tortoise and emphasizes the importance of housingT. graceaindividuals under semi-natural rather than restrictive captive conditions during the breeding season.

AB  - The Testudo graeca complex is a CITES-listed group of taxa (species or subspecies) that is under threat from over-harvesting for the Western pet and Asian food trade. Taxonomically, T graeca populations are in a state of flux. Middle Eastern T graeca in particular are very poorly known because of a lack of adequate sampling, especially in Iran. Two recent studies generated mitochondrial sequence data from Iran using non-overlapping mitochondrial (mt) markers from samples from localities with largely non-overlapping geographical distributions. By generating new sequence data from key Iranian specimens, this study allows for a more comprehensive appraisal of mt phylogeography. Using historic DNA methods, we provide mtDNA sequence data from a 19th century holotype (T. zarudnyi Nikolsky, 1896) along with new data from two recently collected topotypes of other putatively valid taxa (T. buxtoni Boulenger, 1921; Testudo perses Perala, 2002). The new data are used to assess the taxonomic assignments of previously published mtDNA sequences, reinforce the signal of considerable admixture among mt lineages in northwest Iran, establish a reference database for forensic studies of trade specimens and identify areas for future sampling.

AB  - A 4.5-year-old, male African spur-thighed tortoise (Geochelone sulcata) was presented to the University of Florida Veterinary Teaching Hospital with a 2-week history of lethargy, anorexia, constipation, dyspnea, and coughing up fluid or vomiting. Laboratory results included an inflammatory leukogram and a marked increase in plasma uric acid concentration. Synovial fluid from multiple joints was thick, chalky white, and opaque, with a grainy consistency. Microscopically, the fluid contained numerous brown, needle-like crystals consistent with urates (gout). Gross necropsy findings and histopathology confirmed a diagnosis of systemic gout, with urate deposition, gout tophi, and underlying necrosis in multiple organs, including kidneys, lung, and liver. Dehydration with concurrent renal insufficiency may have impaired urate excretion and led to a build-up of urates in the blood and tissues of this tortoise. A high protein diet also may have contributed to the development of gout. Cytologic evaluation of synovial fluid can be used as a quick and definitive tool to diagnose gout in tortoises.

AB  - We tested samples from 1,015 chelonians in Europe for Mycoplasma spp., herpesviruses, ranaviruses, picornaviruses, and ferlaviruses by PCR. Mycoplasma spp. were detected in 42.1% and herpesviruses were detected in 8.0% of tested chelonians. Differentiation of the herpesviruses revealed that 46.9% of the detected chelonian viruses were testudinid herpesvirus 1 (TeHV-1) and 54.3% were TeHV-3, including co-detections of TeHV-1 and -3 in 3 tortoises. TeHV-4 was detected in a leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis), and a herpesvirus that could not be further characterized was found in a pond slider (Trachemys scripta). Picornaviruses (topiviruses) were detected in 2.2% of the tested animals; ferlaviruses were found in 0.6%; no ranaviruses were detected in any of the animals tested. Mycoplasma spp. were detected significantly more often in Horsfield's tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii), leopard tortoises, and Indian star tortoises (Geochelone elegans) than in other species. Horsfield's tortoises were also significantly more often positive for TeHV-1. Mycoplasma and TeHV-1 were co-detected in 3.0%, and mycoplasma and TeHV-3 in 2.3%. The TeHV-4-positive tortoise was also positive for mycoplasma. Mycoplasma and picornaviruses were co-detected in 1.2% of the tortoises. A spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) was positive for mycoplasma and a ferlavirus. In some cases, >2 pathogens were detected. A significant correlation between mycoplasma and herpesvirus detection was found. Of all tested animals, 47.6% were positive for at least one pathogen, demonstrating the importance of pathogen detection in captive chelonians.

AB  - Tortoises of the genus Testudo are the main hosts of Hyalomma aegyptium ticks. This species serves as a vector of several zoonotic pathogens. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the presence of four pathogens associated with H. aegyptium ticks obtained from tortoises from Tunisia. Conventional, multiplex and nested PCRs were used for Aanaplasma phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia canis, Coxiella burnetii and Babesia spp. screening. The molecular analyses revealed the presence of A. phagocytophilum and Babesia spp. None of the ticks, were infected by E. canis or C. burnetii species. Co-infection was detected in four ticks. As a conclusion, this is the first detection of A. phagocytophilum and Babesia spp. in H. aegyptium ticks collected from tortoises, in Tunisia. Thus, considering these results, the spur-thighed tortoise constitute a potential host of H. aegyptium which plays an important role in the transmission of pathogenic agents affecting both human and animals. In term of public health, a strict control and surveillance should be carried to reduce the circulation of such pathogens between different hosts.

AB  - Fire and fire management are recognized as important factors in biodiversity conservation. Measuring species-level demographic, behavioural and population responses to different fire regimes is essential for designing adequate management policies. Here we assessed the impact of fire on survival rates, reproduction and movement patterns in Testudo graeca, an endangered terrestrial tortoise inhabiting the Mediterranean region, a system in which fire plays a relevant role in the functioning of their ecosystems. Then we predicted the probabilities of quasi-extinction of T. graeca under several fire regimes and population sizes by means of stochastic population models. Our results showed that fire caused direct and delayed reductions in local survival, young individuals being the most affected. There were not differences in fecundity and movement patterns of tortoises between burned and unburned areas. Population models showed a strong variation in the probability of quasi-extinction of populations depending on the fire regime and the population size. Under fire frequencies similar to those occurring in the wild (<1 fire every 20-30 years) most tortoise populations seemed to buffer the effects of fires. However, when this threshold value of fire frequency was surpassed, the probability of quasi-extinction of populations exploded for all populations, except for those with the largest sizes. T. graeca populations may be able to cope with natural current fire frequencies, but the effects of more recurrent fires may severely threaten the species. Our results have straightforward applications for fire management purposes in those areas of the Mediterranean region where this endangered species is present. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article presents the results of a comprehensive survey of Guinea with the aim of assessing the burden of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) in rural areas of the country. Human serum samples (n = 2207) were studied using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the presence of specific IgG against CCHFV. In addition, 4273 samples of partially-or fully-engorged ticks from several sources (cattle, domestic and roving dogs, and small mammals) were collected and studied using ELISA and RT-qPCR to detect CCHFV antigen and specific RNA. The data obtained show that 3.0 % of the population in rural Guinea was seropositive, without significant geographical or sexual differences. Seropositive individuals, however, were mainly in the 'active age' group (16-45 years old). Among ticks studied, the estimated prevalence of CCHFV was 1.3 +/- 0.4 %. Five out of eight tick species studied were identified as CCHFV carriers in Guinea. Therefore, it can be assumed that the territory of Guinea is a single, continuous, natural focus of CCHFV. This identified medium intensity focus merits further study.

AB  - The courtship behavior of male Greek tortoises (Testudo graeca) is based on a multiple signaling system that involves tactile, visual, olfactory, and acoustic signals. In some recent studies on marginated (Testudo marginata) and Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) we showed that male mounting success was significantly and positively correlated to the intensity of courtship displays. This was due to the number of rams and bites and the number of calls emitted during mounting, which are considered to be condition-dependent signals that reliably convey information on male quality. In this correlative study, we analyzed relationships between male morphology, hematological profile, courtship intensity, vocalizations, and mounting success in a group of 104 Greek tortoises breeding in seminatural enclosures. As expected, our study showed that mounting success of males was positively correlated to the number of rams and the frequency of interactions during courtship and negatively correlated to the call duration. Moreover the hematocrit was positively correlated with the call rate and the number of rams. Therefore, courtship signals exhibited by male Greek tortoises, including vocalizations, reliably reveal different components of male condition, and females may use these signals to choose high-quality partners, as previously observed in marginated and Hermann's tortoises.

AB  - One of the initial measures to planning the conservation strategies is knowing the ecological needs of a species and its favorite habitat. Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) is an applicable tool to achieve this goal. Zarudny's spur-thighed tortoise or Iranian tortoise (Testudo graeca zarudnyi) is one of three subspecies of spur-thighed tortoises found in Iran. To assess the conflicts threatening the habitat of this subspecies, the Maximum Entropy Algorithm (MaxEnt) was used. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the integrity of the T. g. zarudnyi habitat and discuss the conflicts threatening the suitable habitat of this taxon in Iran. First, 25 ecological variables were considered to evaluate the habitat suitability, including topographic, land use land cover, and climatic layers (19 Bios). Among climatic variables, only five of them were selected using Pearson correlation analysis at the level of 75%. Finally, 11 variables contributed to running the model. The cell size were set based on Bios cell sizes to prevent biases, only one presence point kept at each cell; therefore, 108 presence points were remained out of 137 occurrence data. The obtained model had a high degree of predictability (AUC= 0.911). Results showed that Zarudny's tortoise favorites good to moderate vegetation structure. Hence, areas with higher vegetation cover and an annual average temperature of 20 degrees C are optimal, which emphasizes the importance of landuse changes in both the range dynamics and the conservation of this subspecies in Iran. Considering the overlap of the protected areas with the suitable habitat of Zarudny's tortoise revealed that insufficient amounts of suitable habitat are protected. Hence, considering the vulnerable conservation status of Iranian tortoise, the importance of establishing more protected areas through the suitable habitat of his taxon is emphasized.

AB  - Simple Summary Assessing the body size and body shape variations between sexes and geographical populations can help us understand the adaptive responses of organisms in the face of the pressures to which they are subjected. To evaluate the influence of habitat-type conditions, we selected six Algerian populations of Testudo graeca living in different environments. The results of the traditional morphometric analyses showed that body size and shell shape were smaller and flattened, respectively, in males, especially under unfavorable conditions for tortoises; these changes were jointly caused by anthropogenic and natural pressures. We found clear evidence in several tortoise species that differences in growth durations up to the onset of maturity resulted primarily in different sizes at maturity and ultimately in different adult sizes. Using data for the body size and shell shape of Algerian Testudo graeca, we assessed how proximate causes shaped the observed variation in the morphology of adults. All of the studied populations displayed significant sexual size and shape dimorphisms. Relative to body length, females displayed larger, more voluminous and domed shells than males. We found clear evidence that variation in body size at maturity influenced sexual size dimorphism. Body size at maturity depends on the duration of growth from hatching up to the point of reaching sexual maturity. In the studied populations, sexual maturity, estimated by counting growth lines, was always reached earlier in males than in females (a time difference of 1.4-3.0 years). Similar to sexual size dimorphism, geographic variation in adult body sizes was also influenced by variations in the corresponding sizes at maturity. Remarkably, the population with the largest tortoises had the latest mean maturation time: 9.1 for males and 10.5 for females. Thus, the later completion of maturation was a determinant for a larger size in adulthood. The largest tortoises among the studied populations were measured at the Djelfa locality, where the recorded sizes of males and females reached 186 and 230 mm, respectively.

AB  - In most animal species, it is expected that females should exhibit a greater abdominal volume than males to hold the progeny, when compared with females, males should exhibit more developed attributes that enhance mobility. We tested this hypothesis in the Greek tortoise. In chelonians, a reduction of the openings in the shell improves protection against predation but also constrains the abdominal volume and limits the space available to move the limbs. As expected, our data show that the shell provides a larger abdominal volume relative to tortoise size in females than in males. In males, deep notches in the shell and a reduction of several plastron plates offer more freedom to the limbs and to the tail; these characteristics presumably enhance mating success. Further studies are necessary to assess the applicability of these results in other chelonians, notably freshwater and marine turtles.

AB  - Understanding how species have responded to past climate changes might inform how current climate change may affect species. However, current perspectives on species' response to Quaternary cycles mainly stem from studies on mid and high latitudes and limited information is available at lower latitudes. In these systems a greater variation in individual species' responses to glacial cycles has been suggested, but we lack of clear case studies of such variations. Here, by means of ecological niche modelling, we characterized the niche differentiation of the five subspecies of the tortoise Testudo graeca in north Africa and described the range dynamics suffered by each of the subspecies since the Last Glacial Maxima. Molecular data was employed to infer past population dynamics. The five subspecies present a clear niche differentiation, particularly in relation to rainfall, covering a range from semiarid to humid species. The ecological differentiation among subspecies promotes very different, even opposite, post-glacial range dynamics. Since the Last Glacial Maxima, the ranges have either expanded (T. g. graeca), contracted (T. g. marokkensis), shifted northwards (T. g. soussensis) or remained stable (T. g. cyrenaica and T. g. nabeulensis). Molecular data supported the majority of these range dynamics. Our work exemplifies how, in a climate change scenario, phylogenetically very close taxa (i.e. at the subspecies level) might experience strikingly different biogeographical dynamics due to former niche differentiation. Our work supports an individualistic response to glacial cycles, which can be particularly strong in lower latitudes. In these areas precipitation changes during glacial periods may have strongly affected distribution ranges in idiosyncratic ways. We hypothesize that in those species limited by precipitation the response to glacial cycles (and climate changes) is more unpredictable than in those limited by temperature.

AB  - This work represents the first attempt to model the habitat-species relationships of a species of terrestrial tortoise on a large scale. We applied hierarchical variance partition methodology to Generalised Lineal Models (GLMs), with the presence of the tortoise in 1 km(2) cells as the response variable. We posited the existence of a hierarchical scheme of factors (including climate, relief and lithology, and land-use) that determine the distribution of Testugo graeca in southeastern Spain. We also identified the environmental variables within each factor with the greatest explanatory power and decoupled local vs landscape effects. Climate, followed by relief and lithology, and then land-use, turned out to be the most important factor shaping the distribution of T. graeca in south-east Spain as well as determining the presence of the species within its range. Univariate models showed that the main climate constraints were related to rainfall and extreme minimum temperatures, two factors which could be related to constraints imposed by the length of the annual activity period and productivity. Finally, multi-scale decomposition suggested that neighbouring habitat and local dynamics may also be important in the distribution of the species at the landscape scale.

AB  - Bayesian networks are one of the most powerful tools in the design of expert systems located in an uncertainty framework. However, normally their application is determined by the discretization of the continuous variables. In this paper the naive Bayes (NB) and tree augmented naive Bayes (TAN) models are developed. They are based on Mixtures of Truncated Exponentials (MTE) designed to deal with discrete and continuous variables in the same network simultaneously without any restriction. The aim is to characterize the habitat of the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca graeca), using several continuous environmental variables, and one discrete (binary) variable representing the presence or absence of the tortoise. These models are compared with the full discrete models and the results show a better classification rate for the continuous one. Therefore, the application of continuous models instead of discrete ones avoids loss of statistical information due to the discretization. Moreover, the results of the TAN continuous model show a more spatially accurate distribution of the tortoise. The species is located in the Donana Natural Park, and in semiarid habitats. The proposed continuous models based on MTEs are valid for the study of species predictive distribution modelling. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Mediterranean tortoise (Testudo graeca) is listed as "Vulnerable" on the IUCN Red List. Reproductive characteristics and means to increase offspring production were studied in T graeca terrestris in a semi-natural environment. Courtship and mating occurred during early spring for about 4 weeks, followed by a laying season of approximately 2 months, with a second, shorter mating period in the fall. During the first mating, calcified eggs were already present in the uterus; we inferred that sperm from both mating seasons were stored in the oviduct for fertilization of eggs of the second laying cycle and of the following year. Average egg production was 3.8 +/- 0.3 eggs/year. Most females laid all of their eggs in a single clutch, but 18% laid in a second clutch, 11-21 days later. Xray radiography revealed calcified eggs in the uterus about 4 weeks before oviposition. All eggs in the uterus were calcified simultaneously and were laid in a single clutch; if a second clutch developed, those eggs were also calcified simultaneously. Based on endoscopic examinations, ovaries were active throughout the entire year. Plasma progesterone concentrations in females were very low and were detected only soon after oviposition (440 +/- 141 pg/ml). Plasma estradiol concentrations in females varied from 4.1 +/- 1.5 pg/ml to 70.2 +/- 29.4 pg/ml, with no clear seasonal pattern. Maintaining tortoises at a low environmental temperature (9 +/- 1 degreesC versus 28 +/- 1 degreesC) reduced plasma estradiol concentrations. Giving 2 mg/kg tamoxifen (TAM) increased plasma estradiol to 220 +/- 33 pg/ml when treatment was given in September but not in late October, winter or spring. Treatment with TAM increased the number of eggs laid during the following laying season to 7.3 +/- 1.0 eggs/year, laid in one to three clutches. In males, plasma testosterone concentrations had a seasonal pattern with the onset of a rise in July from 2 to >4 ng/ml, a continued increase to a peak of 12.8 +/- 15.3 ng/ml during November and a decline thereafter. Artificial incubation in sand at 29 +/- 1 degreesC shortened the natural incubation time of 103 +/- 3.1 days to 83.5 +/- 1.3 days, increased hatching rate from 28 to 53%, and increased survival rate from 51 to 71% at 40 weeks of age. In summary, this study provides options for increasing reproductive performance, hatchability and offspring survival in captive Mediterranean tortoises, and may offer new tools for conservation of animals that are on the verge of extinction.

AB  - The narrow Strait of Gibraltar has separated the African and European continents since the Miocene (5.3 Mya), with a different degree of permeability for Mediterranean taxa. Southern and northern regions of the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco, respectively, are key areas to evaluate the colonization dynamics and biogeographic history of taxa occurring at both sides of this strait. The Ibero-Maghrebian subspecies of the European pond turtle, Emys orbicularis occidentalis, is patchily distributed and threatened throughout most of the Iberian Peninsula and northern Morocco and its origin is thought to be in North Africa. Here we expand the geographic sampling across the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco, with special emphasis in the southern tip of the peninsula and northern Morocco, and analyze mtDNA sequences of 183 E.o. occidentalis to better understand the complex biogeographic history of this subspecies. We provide for the first time evidence for shared haplotypes of Iberian and North African pond turtles, with an additional haplotype in the southern Iberian Peninsula derived from Moroccan haplotypes. This supports the hypothesis that the Strait of Gibraltar constitutes no significant biogeographic barrier for E. orbicularis. However, the newly discovered shared, or extremely similar, haplotypes of European pond turtles from the southern Iberian Peninsula and Morocco suggest either that at least two independent natural colonization waves from Morocco have reached the Iberian Peninsula or that Moroccan turtles were accidentally or deliberately introduced there.

AB  - The stimulatory effect of testosterone on male sexual activity is one of the clearest examples linking hormones and behaviors. However, this relationship is complex in Chelonians. We experimentally studied the influence of testosterone levels on the activity budget and space use in male Greek tortoises (Testudo graeca graeca) during the spring mating season. We first described the annual pattern of changes in plasma testosterone levels in free-ranging animals in Morocco. Two peaks, one in winter and one in summer, corresponded to periods of inactivity; whereas mating periods in spring and to a lesser extent in autumn were associated with low plasma testosterone levels. Second, we experimentally manipulated plasma testosterone levels in free-ranging males, and analyzed the behavioral consequences. The strong contrasts in plasma hormone levels induced by the experimental treatments did not result in changes in activity budget or space use, both in the short-term or more than one month after the beginning of the hormonal treatment. Our results suggest that testosterone levels did not influence directly behavioral activity in this species, either immediately or after a time delay of one month. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study aims to identify the ticks living on reptiles of Small Nemrut Mountain as ectoparasites. Field work was carried out between May and November 2016. The mountain which attracts a lot of visitors is an extinct volcano. There are settlements close to the mountain. Furthermore, the area is the upland for the local fauna. 12 reptile species live on the mountain. In the scans on reptiles living in the area, the Hyalomma aegyptium type tick is identified on Testudo graeca (Common Tortoise) and Darevskia valentini (Valentin's Lizard) species. The infestation rate was found to be 66.66% on tortoises and 28.57% on lizards. In the resources, it was reported that Borellia turcica, Theileria spp, Borellia burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, which are microorganisms with high pathogenicity in humans and animals, are isolated from H. aegyptium collected from tortoises. In addition, it was reported in various studies that Hyalomma aegyptium is a reservoir host for Hemoliva mauritanica which is a blood parasite that has been identified to intensively cause diseases in tortoises.

AB  - Objecitive: Establishment of 20 blood reference values of terrestrial tortoises kept in Germany and comparison of the parameters of four different species of mediterranean tortoises. Material and methods: Blood samples were taken from the dorsal coccygeal vein of 61 clinically normal terrestrial tortoises kept in Germany, and 20 hematological and biochemical parameters were analyzed. All animals tested had been raised in or were part of one of five selected tortoise collections for at least three years. All of them were housed outdoors from spring to fall and underwent hibernation regularly. Their diet consisted of exclusively herbivore nourishment. All 61 terrestrial tortoises belonged to the following species: Testudo marginata (marginated tortoise, n = 16), Testudo graeca (spur-thighed tortoise, n 15), Testudo hermanni (Hermann's tortoise, n = 22) and Testudo horsfieldi (Russian tortoise, n = 8). Results: Median, minimum and maximum values and p-values were determined for the following parameters: packed cell volume (PCV), alanin aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), alkaline phosphatase (AP), creatine kinase (CK) uric acid, urea nitrogen (BUN), cholesterol, glucose, fructosamine, total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, cholinesterase (CHE), sodium, potassium, total calcium, ionized calcium and inorganic phosphorus. Conclusions and clinical relevance: Statistically significant differences between tortoise species were detected for 10 out of 20 parameters. The obtained results lead to the conclusion that species differentiation within the group of "mediterranean tortoises" is very important when interpreting blood parameters.

AB  - 1086 tortoise patients belonging to the species Herman's tortoise (Testudo hermanni), Spur-thighed tortoise (T. graeca), Marginated tortoise (T. marginata) and Afghan tortoise (T. horsfieldii) were examined by blood samples referring to kidney diseases. 26.3 % of the animals showed nephropathies. In 15.3 % kidney disease was the main finding and in 11 % it was a secondary finding. Incidence of nephropathies varied referring to age, species and sex of the tortoises.

AB  - Reptiles are traded globally for medicinal purposes. Historic qualitative accounts of reptiles used as medicine in Morocco are numerous, but contemporary quantitative data are rare. In 20132014, we surveyed 49 wildlife markets in 20 towns throughout Morocco, plus the Spanish exclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. We recorded 1,586 specimens of at least nine species for sale in 14 of the Moroccan markets with a combined value of about US $ 100,000. The most prominent markets were those in Marrakesh, Meknes, Casablanca, and Fez, with the former two cites trading equal quantities of dried and live specimens and the latter two trading mainly dried specimens. Common species were the Mediterranean chameleon (Chamaeleo chamaeleon) with 720 specimens (506 dried, 214 alive) and the Bell's Dabb lizard (Uromastyx acanthinura) with 428 specimens (247 dried, 181 alive), both traded in 10 markets, and spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca; 57 carapaces), for sale in eight cities. Over 200 African rock python (Python sebae) skins were identified and may have been illicitly imported from other parts of Africa. The turnover of Mediterranean chameleon and Bell's Dabb lizard specimens after four weeks as measured by repeat surveys was 66% for both species, resulting in an estimated annual turnover of 1,520 chameleons (range 921-2,303) and 775 lizards (range 364-1,174). Despite legal protection and regulations locally within Morocco and internationally through CITES, reptiles are commonly and openly traded for medicinal purposes throughout Morocco. However, traders are not forthcoming in conveying the legal status of these species and restrictions on trade to potential buyers. Increased enforcement of existing wildlife protection legislation is needed to prevent this exploitation from the illegal wildlife trade that could negatively impacts imperiled species.

AB  - Two new species of pinworm parasites of Testudo graeca Linnaeus, 1758 from Morocco are described: Tachygonetria marocana n. sp. and T khallaayounei n. sp. Light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies revealed morphological differences in the structure of the male caudal end and cephalic end, which enabled us to differentiate these new species from the others, and from each other. The following taxa are redescribed: T numidica c Seurat, 1918, T longicollis longicollis (Schneider, 1866), T. l. setosa Petter, 1966, T. l. pusilla Petter, 1966 (parasite of Testudo graeca from Morocco), T. macrolaimus palearcticus Petter, 1966 (parasite of Testudo graeca from Morocco and of Testudo hermanni Gmelin, 1789 from Spain). On the basis of morphology, the subspecies were raised to species level.

AB  - Accurate information on density, structure and vulnerability of wild populations occupies a central place in conservation biology. A mark-recapture study was carried out during the 2003 activity season in a population of Testudo graeca in the Central Jbilets (Morocco). Juveniles were poorly represented in our data set, suggesting that juvenile numbers are actually low in our population and/or that tortoises are easier to capture after the behavioural shift of the acquisition of sexual maturity. Although the studied population was localised in a severely overgrazed area, the estimated adult and sub-adult population density, six individuals/ha, was relatively high comparatively to available estimates in other places. However, within three months of fieldwork, it was possible to capture most of the adults (60%), suggesting that Testudo graeca graeca populations are very sensitive to illegal and repeated harvesting. Long-term monitoring of the population is required to better appreciate the demographic trend of this population.

AB  - Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever is endemic in Bulgaria where the primary vector and reservoir are ticks Hyalomma marginatum. The present study examined the role of ticks Hyalomma aegyptium parasit-izing on tortoises Testudo graeca in circulation of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus. A total of 81 ticks H. aegyptium were collected from 23 specimens of T. graeca in Kardzhali District, SE Bulgaria. Real-time RT-PCR was performed for the detection of CCHFV RNA. CCHFV genome was detected in 10 specimens of H. aegyptium collected from two T. graeca hosts (infection rate 12.3 %). Further studies on H. aegyptium and their hosts are needed to assess their role as CCHFV vectors and reservoirs in SE Bulgaria.

AB  - Captive reptiles often show higher growth rates than in the wild, possibly due to higher feeding intensity. Although health problems are usually linked to inappropriate diets, fast growth itself, such as triggered by appropriate diets fed in high amounts, has traditionally also been considered unfavorable for tortoises. We document growth rates (based on age and mass) from private Testudo hermanni and T. graeca breeders, which are generally higher than those reported for free-ranging specimens, but show enormous variation. Tortoise patients presented to an exotics clinic also covered the whole growth rate spectrum. To test whether fast growth was associated with diseases, the agebody mass relationship of these patients was tested, in a retrospective evaluation, for additional influence factors, such as dietary history and occurrence of certain diet and growth-related diseases. No indication was found that animals particularly heavy for their age were more prone to diet/growth-related disorders. In general, tortoises fed diets with meat/grain were heavier for their age than tortoises fed more appropriate diets; dietary history was not related to a particular disease. The results suggest the agebody mass relationship may not be suitable for testing effects of fast growth; an agebody length relationship would be more appropriate. Animals presented for a diet/growth-related disorder were younger than animals presented for other reasons; there was a significant negative correlation between the severity of pyramiding and age, suggesting that growth-related disorders may well limit the life expectancy of tortoises. Controlled clinical studies are required to fully test this hypothesis. Zoo Biol. 31:705-717, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are recognized as affecting the nature of biotic interactions, although we still know little about such changes for reptilian herbivores and their hindgut nematodes, in which endosymbiont interactions could range from mutualistic to commensal and parasitic. We investigated the potential cost and benefit of endosymbiont interactions between the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca L.) and adult oxyurid nematodes (Pharyngodonidae order Oxyurida) in scrublands of southern Spain. For this, we assessed the association between richness and abundance of oxyurid species with tortoises' growth rates and body traits (weight and carapace length) across levels of habitat loss (low, intermediate and high). Furthermore, by using an intrapopulation ecological network approach, we evaluated the structure and diversity of tortoise-oxyurid interactions by focusing on oxyurid species infesting individual tortoises with different body traits and growth rates across habitats. Overall, tortoise body traits were not related to oxyurid infestation across habitats. Oxyurid richness and abundance however, showed contrasting relationships with growth rates across levels of habitat loss. At low habitat loss, oxyurid infestation was positively associated with growth rates (suggesting a mutualistic oxyurid-tortoise relationship), but the association became negative at high habitat loss (suggesting a parasitic relationship). Furthermore, no relationship was observed when habitat loss was intermediate (suggesting a commensal relationship). The network analysis showed that the oxyurid community was not randomly assembled but significantly nested, revealing a structured pattern for all levels of habitat loss. The diversity of interactions was lowest at low habitat loss. The intermediate level, however, showed the greatest specialization, which indicates that individuals were infested by fewer oxyurids in this landscape, whereas at high habitat loss individuals were the most generalized hosts. Related to the latter, connectance was greatest at high habitat loss, reflecting a more uniform spread of interactions among oxyurid species. At an individual level, heavier and larger tortoises tended to show a greater number of oxyurid species interactions. We conclude that there is an association between habitat loss and the tortoise-oxyurid interaction. Although we cannot infer causality in their association, we hypothesize that such oxyurids could have negative, neutral and positive consequences for tortoise growth rates. Ecological network analysis can help in the understanding of the nature of such changes in tortoise-oxyurid interactions by showing how generalized or specialized such interactions are under different environmental conditions and how vulnerable endosymbiont interactions might be to further habitat loss.

AB  - Hemolivia mauritanica is an apicomplexan parasite infecting the tortoises Testudo graeca and Testudo marginata as the intermediate vertebrate host, and the tick Hyalomma aegyptium as the definitive invertebrate host. Here, we used molecular techniques to detect an apparent H. mauritanica in the ticks H. aegyptium, attached to Testudo graeca from North Africa. Sequences from 18S rRNA were used to place the new sequences, and others retrieved from GenBank, in a phylogenetic framework. A single Hemolivia haplotype was recovered from 16 ticks. Prevalence was estimated at 22.6% of hosts having ticks infected with H. mauritanica.

AB  - Habitat preference is determined by complex interactions between biotic and abiotic habitat features and species-specific requirements. In many terrestrial organisms, studies of habitat preference emphasize the role of vegetation. Yet, in land-dwelling ectotherms, an often-overlooked characteristic that may have a strong effect on habitat preference is soil type. We followed 18 Spur-thighed Tortoises (Testudo graeca) mounted with radio transmitters to quantify their seasonal activity patterns, home-range sizes, and preferred habitats, including soil type. We used Maximum Entropy to quantify the spatial distribution of Testudo graeca in the study area based on species occurrence records and nine environmental variables derived from LiDAR. We describe for the first time a strong preference for soil type in Testudo graeca, as well as preference for flat terrain (avoidance of steep slopes). Individuals avoided areas with dense woody vegetation and chose habitats containing heterogeneous vegetation, including isolated trees, shrubs, and open patches. We further found that individuals in the study area do not hibernate but decrease activity in summer-autumn. Finally, home-range size was comparable between the sexes. The overlapping home ranges within and between the sexes throughout the year, including the mating season, suggest that this species is not territorial.

AB  - We documented differential blood cell counts and plasma pollypeptide profiles in Testudo graeca and 7: horsfieldii raised in captivity in Lebanon, and investigated bioactivity of T graeca plasma against a human colon cancer cell line (HCT-116). The percentage of red blood cells, thrombocytes, heterophills, basophills, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils did not differ significantly between the species during winter or spring. The total number of plasma polypeptides differed between the species, with 2 additional polypeptide bands in 7: horsfieldii. Plasma from T graeca significantly affected the percentage proliferation and percentage viability of human cancer cell line HCT-116.

AB  - Biting midges of the genus Leptoconops, subgenus Leptoconops (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) were repeatedly found parasitizing on spur-thighed tortoises Testudo graeca in western Syria and Lebanon. Collected females were assigned to the species L. bezzii according to their morphological characteristics. Tortoises parasitized by midges were observed throughout the daytime, under mild temperatures, and slight winds, in Mediterranean or stony steppe habitats. Intensity of the infestations ranged from a few specimens up to thousands of midges per tortoise. Midges infested predominantly the tortoises' carapax, finding their approach to the capillaries in the seams between the keratinized scutes. The vector potential of ceratopogonids is discussed.

The new species is described based on the morphology of its blood stages and a segment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, which can be used for molecular identification and diagnosis. Chelonian haemoproteids recorded in the past were defined solely on the basis of their morphological characteristics. The chelonian haemoproteid we describe as a new species has a close genetic relationship to lizard haemoproteids, i.e., Haemoproteus ptyodactylii and Haemoproteus kopki. The new species description provides significant new information for little-known chelonian haemoproteids.

AB  - We studied the activity patterns of Testudo graeca over 2 yr using the method of thread trailing on 131 individuals. The tortoises were active for about half of the year and exhibited a bimodal annual activity pattern, with well defined aestivation and hibernation periods. Daily distances moved averaged about 50 m/day throughout the year, the maximum distances being 1019 m/day for males and 316 m/day for females. There were temporal differences between male and female activity patterns, consisting of an earlier emergence of males from hibernation and a delay in entering aestivation of females. Tortoises were active mainly on non-rainy days with maximum temperature ranging from 20-30 C, minimum temperature from 6.5-15 C, relative humidity from 35-75%, and accumulated radiation from 24-42 kw/cm(2). However, tortoises were also active under much more extreme values. Female activity was more dependent on exogenous factors while males showed a stronger response to endogenous factors. In both sexes, the largest distances moved were related with the reproductive cycle, constraining tortoises to phases of activity under suboptimal environmental conditions: males at the beginning of courtship in late winter and females in the post-nesting recovery phase in early summer.

AB  - It is the first time that Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), causing potentially lethal disease of humans, has been reported from the Middle East region and from the tortoise tick Hyalomma aegyptium from a tortoise host, whose epidemiological significance may have remained almost completely overlooked so far. We used RT-PCR to screen for 245 ticks collected from 38 Testudo graeca tortoise individuals. Results of our genetic screening provide unambiguous evidence of occurrence of CCHFV in this region and host, suggesting a potentially important role of H. aegyptium in CCHF epidemiology.

AB  - We described the high diversity of morphotypes of spur-thighed tortoises (the Testudo graeca complex) that inhabit the Araks River Valley. The habitat conditions of tortoises was highly correlated with their external morphology, where the variety of environmental conditions along the Araks River Valley affects the morphological plasticity of tortoises. We speculate that the diversity of external morphology of tortoises might have been promoted by admixed gene expression combined with a high environmental flexibility of the shell in different habitat conditions, as well as by geographical isolation of T. graeca in fragmented areas of distribution in the Ararat Valley.

AB  - The article discusses the features of eggs, the confinement of oviposition to certain stages of embryonic development, and its adaptive significance in some oviparous reptile species in Azerbaijan. Information is reported on the size and numbers of eggs in clutches, stages of development of embryos at the time of oviposition, as well as the timing of natural incubation of eggs in the Mediterranean tortoise (Testudo graeca ibera) and the Levantine viper (Macrovipera lebetina obtusa), including providing information on the size and number of eggs in clutches, as well as the relationship between the number of eggs in clutches and their size and weight. It has been experimentally proven that it is by the day of oviposition that embryos acquire the greatest resistance to temperature factors of the external environment. The embryos are most protected in eggs of a turtle with a hard shell (Testudo graeca), eggs are laid in the early stages of embryonic development (beginning and middle of gastrulation). However, in the Levantine viper (Macrovipera lebetina obtusa), the eggs are covered only with a fibrous membrane and the laying of eggs occurs at later stages of embryonic development (the stage of laying the tongue). It was also identified that in both species the ranges of morphological variability of embryos at the time of oviposition, in populations living at different heights, are the same. The tactical variability in the reproduction of oviparous reptiles is thought to be a result of their evolutionary adaptation to land reproduction. The incubation of eggs in the external environment lasted 80-85 days in the tortoise and 50-55 days in the viper. This is because in turtles, eggs are laid earlier, and in the Levantine viper at later stages of embryo development. In the Levantine viper, a significant part of the development of the embryos (30-35 days) occurs while the eggs are in the oviducts of the female.

AB  - Numerous sites showing human occupation during the Pleistocene were discovered at the Hula Valley - in the northern segment of the Jordan Valley, Israel. At the Middle Paleolithic site of Nahal Mahanayeem Outlet (NMO; OSL dated to ca. 65,000 B.P.), two testudine species were recovered, a freshwater turtle - the Western Caspian Turtle (Mauremys cf. rivulata), and a tortoise - the Mediterranean Spur-thighed Tortoise (Testudo graeca). The faunal and lithic assemblages were deposited during repeated short-term occupation events. The site was fast covered by mud deposited by rising water in the nearby paleo-Hula Lake, resulting in excellent preservation that provides a rare opportunity to reconstruct the process of procurement, use and eventual disposal of the testudines step-by-step. Evidence of consumption of the Mediterranean Spur-thighed and its carapace exists from the late Lower Paleolithic onward, however, no systematic exploitation of the Western Caspian Turtle has been reported to date from any Pleistocene archaeological sites in the Levant. This is the first and earliest evidence of butchering of the freshwater turtle, M. cf. rivulata, at a Levantine Paleolithic site. Based on detailed taxonomic identification and taphonomic analysis, we suggest that both species were exploited in a similar way at NMO. Their limbs were torn apart, and then the bridge connecting the carapace and plastron was broken. Stone tools were used to separate visceral tissues from the peripheral bones in order to detach the meat. However, due to the different shell thickness, the survival rate of the bridge area varies slightly between the two species. Finally we would like to draw attention to the presence of pits mimicking man-made percussion notches on the shells of extant specimen of both species, advocating caution when identifying percussion signs in the fossil record.

AB  - Testudo graeca has a wide distribution under different geographic, climatic and ecological conditions, and shows high morphological differences especially in the Asian (Middle Eastern and Caucasian) parts of the range. This study investigates morphometric and genetic differentiation in the T graeca complex in Turkey using the densest sampling to date. We sequenced two mt-DNA loci (ND4 and cyt b) of 199 samples and combined them with previously published data. Bayesian analysis yielded six well-supported clades, four of which occur in Turkey (ibera, terrestris, armeniaca and buxtoni). The armeniaca mtDNA Glade locally represents a morphometrically distinct burrowing ecomorph. However, previous studies have shown that individuals outside Turkey possessing armeniaca mtDNA lack the distinctive armeniaca morphotype we observed, precluding taxonomic conclusions.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies revealed substantial differences in the structure of the mouth and the caudal end, and made possible to differentiate the new species from the others. SEM studies showed the real and sound characteristics of the genus Mehdiella, namely number of anal papillae 2 instead of 3, post-anal papillae pedunculate or sessile instead sessile.

AB  - Collecting tortoises for the pet trade is one of the factors threatening species of Testudo in the Mediterranean area. The collection of Testudo graeca graeca for pets is described in southeast Spain, where the main European population of this subspecies coincides with an area where keeping tortoises in captivity is a long-established custom. This present paper, based on inquiries made to children, reveals that this practice continues to be a common activity, and estimates a captive population in the order of tens of thousand of tortoises. Tortoises are collected as a result of chance encounters with wild animals by local inhabitants, and without any commercial objectives. The captive breeding and the release of tortoises without any institutional control is also common. These activities could be an important threat for the species. Implications for conservation are discussed and a critical review of the conservation strategies developed in relation to this threat (trade control and re-introduction programmes) are presented. We suggest that environmental education programmes are necessary to reduce casual collection and to change the social perception of tortoises as pets. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) is a globally endangered raptor species, whose populations are declining across its range. Although Turkey has one of the largest population in Western Palearctic Region, studies on the species are quite limited, and data on its diet in the country are almost non-existent. To fulfil some of these gaps, we undertook a study on the breeding success and the diet of the Egyptian vulture population in Middle and Upper Sakarya Region in 2013 and 2014, during which 53 territorial pairs were located. The breeding success rate of the population was 1.09 in 2013 and 1.21 in 2014, while the fledgling rates were 1.35 and 1.27, respectively. Egyptian vultures in Middle and Upper Sakarya Region have a wide diet spectrum: remains of Greek Tortoise (Testudo graeca) with 12.4 % were the most frequent items in the examined samples. Remains of sheep (Ovis aries) and fox (Vulpes vulpes) with 10 % are second most frequent item. The studied population with its high breeding parameters is of importance for the species conservation in a regional context.

AB  - Reproduction in female spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) in a population from southwestern Spain was studied by X-radiography of thread-trailed and radio-tagged individuals. Most females reproduce every year, laying one to four clutches from April to June with internesting intervals ranging from 21 to 29 days. Clutch size varied from 1 to 7 eggs and averaged 3.5 eggs. Carapace length and mass of females were positively correlated with the starting date and duration of the nesting season, while age was not correlated with any reproductive variable. Eggs averaged 33.87 x 27.97 mm in dimensions and 14.4 g in mass. Female mobility increased shortly before or after nesting, which resulted in wide dispersal of the various nests laid by an individual female.

AB  - In this study, some biochemical parameters (glucose, urea, calcium, triglyceride, cholesterol, creatinine, uric acid, total protein, iron, albumin, phosphorus, H.D.L., magnesium) hemoglobin and hematocrit depending on the pre-reproductive and reproductive periods and sex were determined in a total of 20 Testudo graeca specimens in the canakkale (Turkey). For the biochemical parameters, 0,5 ml of blood was collected from the scale in the lateral ligament of the neck with a 5-ml aspirating syringe. The blood was transferred into the biochemical tubes and centrifuged; the plasma part was separated and was measured by spectrophotometer. In conclusion, plasma biochemistry parameters were determined on sex-related pre-reproduction and reproduction periods in T. graeca. When comparing the pre-reproductive and the reproductive period in terms of glucose, uric acid and iron values, statistical differences were found in the females. It was determined that cholesterol values of males were significantly different between periods. In the females, glucose value was found high in the pre-reproductive period and uric acid and iron values were high in the reproductive period. Cholesterol values of males were found high in the pre-reproductive period. Iron levels in the pre-reproductive period were significantly different between males and females.

The following taxa were redescribed: Tachygonetria conica (Drasche, 1883) and T. robust a (Drasche, 1883) (both from the large intestine of Testudo graeca collected in Settat, Morocco); the subspecies Tachygonetria conica nicollei (Seurat, 1918) is suppressed. A new species, T. combesi n. sp. is described from the large intestine of Testudo hermanni, which confirms the revision of the genus. Scanning electron microscopical studies revealed substantial interspecific differences in the structure of the caudal end.

AB  - We assessed mortality causes and survival rates for 59 free ranging Testudo graeca hatchlings. Individuals were followed for varying lengths of time from emergence from the nest in August-September to April using thread-trailing. Hatchlings died from unknown causes, mainly soon after emergence and belonged mainly to clutches which contained also unhatched eggs. Other causes of mortality were predation, car traffic, and trampling by large ungulates during the activity season (autumn and spring). Predation was low, and available data on potential predator diets also indicate low predation upon hatchlings. We found seasonal differences in survival; highest survival was in winter and lowest in spring. The overall survival rate for the 8 mo period was 0.39. Mortality causes registered during continuous monitoring were similar to anecdotal observations recorded over an 11 yr period.

AB  - Ticks were collected from 30 Greek tortoise (Testudo graeca), and 10 Arabian camels (dromedary) (Camelus dromedarius) in Israel. All those collected from Greek tortoises belonged to Hyalomma aegyptium, while all specimens collected from the camels belonged to Hyalomma dromedarii. Out of 84 specimens of H. aegyptium, 31 pools were examined by PCR, while from 75 H. dromedarii specimens nine pools were studied. Out of 31 pools of H. aegyptium 26 were positive for pathogens or endosymbiont; 14 for one, 11 for two and one for three pathogens. Out of nine pools prepared from H. dromedarii, seven were positive for pathogens (two for C. burnetii and five for Leishmania infantum). In H. aegyptium, Rickettsia africae, Rickettsia aeschlimannii, Rickettsia endosymbiont, Coxiella burnetii, Hemolivia mauritanica, Babesia microti, Theileria sp., and Leishmania infantum was detected, while in H. dromedarii C. burnetii and L. infantum were found. None of the ticks were positive for Anaplasma/Ehrlichia, Listeria monocytogenes, Bartonella spp., Hepatozoon spp. and Toxoplasma gondii. H Rickettsia endosymbionts, C. burnetii, B. microti, Theileria sp. and L. infantum are reported for the first time in H. aegyptium, and C. burnetii and L. infantum for the first time in H. dromedarii.

AB  - Adult males of Testudo graeca were used to preliminarily study the light microscopic morphology and the ultrastructure of the testes. Spermiogenesis has shown the presence of some interspecific variations among Chelonia, while the general features of the testes and spermatocytes are morphologically similar to other reptilians. The male reproductive state observed in the months analysed has shown spermatogenesis recrudescence in spring, a complete germinal series in autumn and testicular regression in winter. The observation of ultrastructural features, characteristic of steroidogenic activity, suggests a synchrony in tubular and interstitial compartments in T. graeca, with little steroidogenic activity in winter and active synthesis in spring and autumn. In conclusion, the results of this histological study suggest a probable asynchrony between the male and female reproductive cycle in this species and show synchrony in the steroidogenic activity of Sertoli and Leydig cells.

AB  - Deslorelin acetate is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist formulated in a controlled-release subcutaneous implant and designed for reversible suppression of testosterone production in dogs. It has also been demonstrated to be effective in other animal species, but no data on its effectiveness in male land tortoises are available. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a 4.7-mg deslorelin acetate implant on serum testosterone concentrations in male Hermann's (Testudo hermanni sp.) and Greek (Testudo graeca sp.) tortoises. Twenty adult male tortoises housed under the same environmental conditions were enrolled for the study and randomly assigned to a treatment (D, n = 10) or a control (C, n = 10) group. Starting in May, males from the D group were implanted with a 4.7-mg deslorelin acetate device, whereas males from the C group did not receive any treatment. Blood samples were collected once immediately before implant application (S0-May) and at 15 days (S1-June), 2 (S2-July), and 5 (S3-October) months after application. Serum testosterone at each sampling time was measured through a solid-phase, enzyme-labeled, competitive chemiluminescent immunoassay. Median serum testosterone concentrations were not significantly different between the two groups in all sampling times, and no interaction between treatment and sampling time was observed. The present study, therefore, suggests that a single treatment with a 4.7-mg deslorelin acetate implant has no effect on testosterone circulation in male Hermann's and Greek tortoises during the following 5 months.

AB  - Morphometric analyses were carried out on Testudo graeca from west-central Morocco, and compared to previously published mitochondrial DNA sequence variation. We measured 41 characters on 244 tortoises from three localities, including one population of T.g. soussensis from Souss Valley. All three populations could be statistically differentiated in a multivariate space using these characters. The population from the Jbilet mountains was the most differentiated (no overlap), those from Essaouira on the coast and from Admine showed limited overlap (5%). Sexual size dimorphism (males < females) remained constant between sites. Sexual shape dimorphism was prominent in all populations, but the degree of dimorphism differed for some characters when corrected for size. Tortoises from Jbiiet living under harsher conditions (low precipitation, high thermal amplitude, low plant cover) were smaller, lighter, more flattened and less dimorphic in shape than the others. Although the Admine population (currently assigned to T g. soussensis) was morphologically distinct, its distinctiveness was less supported than in the case of Jbilet; several other qualitative traits previously considered as defining this subspecies were also questionable. Moreover, this morphological variation contrasted with the available genetic evidence (12S rRNA mtDNA) which did not reveal significant variation between any of the populations. This implies that morphological differences have either arisen very recently or can be attributed to phenotypic plasticity. This should be taken into account when using morphological traits for taxonomic considerations and conservation management.

AB  - Free-living and captive chelonians might suffer from upper respiratory tract disease (URTD), a pathology primarily caused by Mycoplasma agassizii. Wild tortoises can also be an important reservoir of Salmonella spp., which are commensal in the host reptile but are potential zoonotic agents. Between July 2009 and June 2010, we screened free-living European tortoises (spur-thighed tortoises Testudo graeca, Hermann's tortoises Testudo hermanni, marginated tortoises Testudo marginata) temporarily housed in a wildlife center in Italy. We molecularly characterized 13 Mycoplasma isolates detected in all Testudo spp. studied, and three PCR-positive animals showed typical URTD clinical signs at the time of sampling. Three Salmonella enterica serotypes (Abony, Potsdam, Granlo), already related to reptile-associated human infections, were also identified. These results highlight the potential role played by wildlife recovery centers in the spread and transmission of pathogens among wild chelonians and to humans.

AB  - Hyalomma aegyptium (L., 1758) (Ixodida: Ixodidae) is a hard tick and the main host for adults are Palearctic tortoises of the genus Testudo, while larvae and nymphs are less host-specific and nymphs also attach to humans. In the present study, a total of 261 H. aegyptium ticks were removed from 26 Testudo graeca L., 1758 in Corum Province of Turkey. The most prevalent pathogens identified molecularly in the ticks were Hemolivia mauritanica (51.9 %), followed by Rickettsia aeschlimannii (32.6 %), Ehrlichia spp. (30.2 %), and Bartonella bovis (0.8 %). All samples were negative for Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia spp., Hepatozoon spp. and Theileria spp. Overall, 97.4 % of the examined adult ticks and 26.3 % of nymphs were infected with at least one pathogen, while 40.9 % of all ticks were infected with only one pathogen, 27.4 % with two pathogens, and 9.9 % with three pathogens, concomitantly. Overall, 80.8 % of the examined blood smears of tortoises were H. mauritanica-positive, and the mean intensity of parasitemia was 4.8 % (1-21). As a conclusion, since the examined tortoises were sampled in gardens and vineyards close to human habitation, and as a rela-tively large percentage of them were infested with ticks carrying pathogenic agents affecting also humans, the importance of tortoises, their ticks and pathogens in terms of the public health should be farther examined.

AB  - Assessing the spatial structure of abundance of a species is a basic requirement to carry out adequate conservation strategies. However, existing attempts to predict species abundance, particularly in absolute units and on large scales, are scarce and have led to weak results. In this work we present a scheme to obtain, in an affordable way, a predictive model of absolute animal abundance on large scales based on the modelling of data obtained from local ecological knowledge (LEK) and its calibration. To exemplify this scheme, we build and validate a predictive absolute abundance model of the endangered terrestrial tortoise Testudo graeca in Southeast Iberian Peninsula. For that purpose, we collected distribution and relative abundance data of T. graeca using a low cost methodology, such as LEK, by means of interviewing shepherds. The information from LEK was employed to build a predictive habitat-based model of relative abundance. The relative abundance model was transformed into an absolute abundance model by means of calibration with a classical absolute abundance sampling method such as distance sampling. The obtained absolute abundance model predicted the observed absolute abundances values well in independent locations when compared with other works (R (2) = 36%) and thus can offer a cost-effective predictive ability. Our results show that reliable habitat-based predictive maps of absolute species abundance on regional scales can be obtained starting from low cost sampling methods of relative abundance, such as LEK, and its calibration.

AB  - Kebara's Neanderthal inhabitants used spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) for food and perhaps also for containers. Tortoise mean body size appears to track major paleoclimatic fluctuations documented in the oxygen-isotope record of Soreq Cave (Israel), with larger means during warmer-moister periods and smaller means during colder-drier periods. Body size also tracks site function, with larger means during periods of ephemeral site use. And body size tracks site seasonality, with larger means during warm-season occupations, when tortoises would have been least active. Body size declined sharply toward the end of the Middle Paleolithic, perhaps reflecting a pulse in human population growth that increased the level of predation pressure on these creatures. This conclusion must be regarded with caution, however, because Kebara's early Upper Paleolithic (Ahmarian) occupations were very ephemeral, and therefore would not have impacted local tortoise populations as heavily as the body-size reduction would imply.

AB  - Two tortoises, Testudo graeca ibera Pallas, 1814 and Testudo hermanni boettgeri (Mojsisovics, 1889), inhabit Bulgaria. Certain features normally used for their identification, such as division of the supracaudal scute (divided in T. h. boettgeri; undivided in T. g. ibera), are not absolute. Seven whole shells of T. g. ibera and eleven of T. h. boettgeri were studied, and also a large series of shell fragments of both species. Based on analysis of 44 shell characters, T. h. boettgeri was distinguished by the following: maximal width of vertebral scute V clearly greater than maximal widths of other vertebral scutes; width of vertebral scutes II, III and IV smaller than width of pleural scutes I, II and III; medial length of pectoral scute equal or slightly greater than half the medial length of the hypoplastron; hypo-xiphiplastral suture distant from the corner of the inguinal notch; medial length of xiphiplastron less than maximal width (in females), or nearly half the maximal width (in males).

AB  - A cycle of glacial and interglacial periods in the Quaternary caused species' ranges to expand and contract in response to climatic and environmental changes. During interglacial periods, many species expanded their distribution ranges from refugia into higher elevations and latitudes. In the present work, we projected the responses of the five lineages of Testudo graeca in the Middle East and Transcaucasia as the climate shifted from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, Mid - Holocene), to the present. Under the past LGM and Mid-Holocene bioclimatic conditions, models predicted relatively more suitable habitats for some of the lineages. The most significant bioclimatic variables in predicting the present and past potential distribution of clades are the precipitation of the warmest quarter for T. g. armeniaca (95.8 %), precipitation seasonality for T. g. buxtoni (85.0 %), minimum temperature of the coldest month for T. g. ibera (75.4 %), precipitation of the coldest quarter for T. g. terrestris (34.1 %), and the mean temperature of the driest quarter for T. g. zarudyni (88.8 %). Since the LGM, we hypothesise that the ranges of lineages have either expanded (T. g. ibera), contracted (T. g. zarudnyi) or remained stable (T. g. terrestris), and for other two taxa (T. g. armeniaca and T. g. buxtoni) the pattern remains unclear. Our analysis predicts multiple refugia for Testudo during the LGM and supports previous hypotheses about high lineage richness in Anatolia resulting from secondary contact.

AB  - In the last decade, Asian populations of Testudo graeca were split into as many as 10 species based on morphology and morphometry and then subsequently synonymized based on genetic evidence. We generate new morphometric data for six of these disputed species from Turkey, a major center of morphological and genetic diversity for Asian T. graeca. We test the concordance of our data with previous morphological assignments. Our morphometric data and analyses do not support all of the results of previous morphometric studies. Instead we find that putatively named taxa from the Mediterranean coast ("antakyensis", "anamurensis", and "terrestris") are not morphometrically distinct. On the other hand, some inland populations from eastern Turkey ("armeniaca" and "perses") are morphometrically distinct as previously claimed. Tortoise populations from northern and southern Turkey, which may correspond to the ibera and terrestris mt clades, also appear to be morphometrically distinct. In this respect, the morphometric data reflects the emerging genetic pattern, although the picture is complicated by a lack of genetic sampling within Turkey and morphometric studies outside of Turkey.

AB  - Testudo graeco tortoises were collected in the northern and southern Golan Heights (Israeli occupied territory of south Syria), and various locations in Israel end Palestine. Hyclommo aegyptium ticks were found only on Golan Height tortoises, and only the tortoises and ticks from the northern Golan Heights were infected with Hemolivia mouritonica. Tortoises became infected after ingesting infected ticks. Male ticks carrying sporocysts, which remain attached to tortoises for extended durations, apparently served as the source for dissemination of new infections among tortaises Sporogenesis followed the pattern observed in the two other known species of Hemolivia, though there was some evident variation in fine-structural detail. The sutural slit detected in the H. mouritanica mature sporocyst wall was reminiscent of the suture characteristic of Coccidia of heterothermic vertebrate hosts; it could be a common ancestral character for both hemogregarines and Caccidia.

AB  - Activity, mobility, growth rates, and space use of 48 hatchling spur-thighed tortoises, Testudo graeca, were monitored over st period of 8 months, from emergence from the nest in September until May. Individuals were followed by means of thread trailing and radio tracking. Overall average distance moved was 4.42 m/day and average home-range size was 13.7 m(2). Hatchlings were active from emergence until mid-December, exhibited discontinuous hibernation until mid-February, and reached highest activity and mobility values in April-May. Overall, mobility varied significantly with daily solar radiation values and maximum temperature, and was significantly dependent on body condition in winter. Body size and mass had no influence on individual performance, and a significant proportion of variance among individuals remained unexplained. Little growth occurred in autumn and body condition decreased steadily, increasing only from February onwards. Growth rates increased in March-April. No individual differences in growth rates were detected, initial body size being the main determinant of body size after 8 months.

AB  - Until the late 1970s spur-thighed tortoises Testudo graeca, endemic to the Mediterranean region, were exported from range countries in large volumes for the pet trade. Testudo graeca was included on CITES Appendix II in 1975, and in 1978 Morocco introduced national protection, banning domestic and international trade. However, the species is still openly traded in Moroccan markets. In 2013-2014 we conducted 48 surveys in 20 Moroccan towns and cities and single surveys in two Spanish exclaves to assess trade levels, size-composition, turnover, and variation between cities. We recorded 3267 T. graeca in 107 shops in 12 cities. Of 989 tortoises measured, two-thirds measured <10 cm (similar to 2-8 years of age) and <3% could comprise first-year individuals. There is a clear relationship between price and size, with 'average' tortoises costing USD 9.20. The largest volumes were observed in Tangier (869) and Rabat (752), two cities that are well-connected centres of export. The largest proportion of shops selling tortoises was in Agadir (78%) and Fez (63%), and turnover was highest in Tangier (32/week) and Casablanca (28/week). Country-wide turnover was similar to 30% after two weeks and similar to 80% after 10 weeks. Annual turnover was estimated at 3500-7000 tortoises, with a monetary value of USD 30 000-60 000. Predictors for volumes of trade and proportion of shops selling tortoises are: the number of wildlife shops in markets, diversity of wild vertebrate species the shops have on offer, and city population. While legal, large-scale international trade of spur-thighed tortoises from Morocco has diminished over the last decades, domestic smaller-scale trade continues to impede their conservation. Consistent punitive measures are required to enforce new laws.

AB  - Terrestrial chelonians are threatened worldwide by habitat destruction and illegal harvesting. Tortoises are slow moving animals susceptible to dehydration and overheating during movements in open habitats. Many species inhabit arid steppes where the availability of thermally buffered refuges (e.g. burrows) is a limiting factor. Determining the maximal distance between refuges that individuals can safely traverse during the active season is thus essential. We examined the relationship between body temperature variations and movement patterns in adult Testudo graeca in the arid steppes of Morocco. Using physical and mathematical models, our results suggest that during the active season adults cannot travel more than 1 km without serious risk of overheating. However, radio-tracking suggests that free-ranging individuals are behaviourally limited to 0.5 km trips between refuges. Overall, maintaining a distance less than 0.5 km between refuges (e.g. through bush planting) is essential to limit fragmentation and to retain healthy populations. This restoration would also benefit to many other species that depend on bush-refuges. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - P>The prevalence of Salmonella infection was determined in a group of spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) seized during two smuggling attempts and in a population of captive Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) sheltered in a wildlife rescue centre. Salmonella spp. was isolated in 81 of 220 (36.8%) and in 17 of 67 (25.4%) cloacal swabs collected from the T. graeca and T. hermanni tortoises respectively. Overall, a total of 21 different Salmonella serotypes were found. Some of these serotypes are common to terrestrial chelonians while others have never been reported. All cultured serotypes were non-typhoidal but nonetheless many of these have been previously reported as source of human outbreaks of reptile-related salmonellosis. Eighty-two per cent and 5.3% of the isolates were resistant to two and three anti-microbial agents respectively. However, the isolates were highly susceptible to the anti-microbials of choice for the treatment of salmonellosis such as cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. Our findings confirm that tortoises can be considered a reservoir for Salmonella and that care should be employed when handling and breeding these animals. Tight surveillance should be enforced to avoid illegal importation and prevent the trading of live tortoises, carriers of zoonotic pathogens.

AB  - Context Land-use change is one of the main threats to biodiversity on the global scale. Legacy effects of historical land-use changes may affect population dynamics of long-lived species, but they are difficult to evaluate through observational studies alone. We present here an interdisciplinary modelling approach as an alternative to address this problem in landscape ecology. Objectives Assess effects of agricultural abandonment and anthropisation on the population dynamics of long-lived species. Specifically, we evaluated: (a) how changes in movement patterns caused by land-use change might impact population dynamics; (b) time-lag responses of demographic variables in relation to land-use changes. Methods We applied an individual-based and spatial-explicit simulation model of the spur-tighed tortoise (Testudo graeca), an endangered species, to sequences of real-world landscape changes representing agricultural abandonment and anthropisation at the local scale. We analysed different demographic variables and compared an "impact scenario" (i.e., historical land-use changes) with a "control scenario" (no land-use changes). Results While agricultural abandonment did not lead to relevant changes in demographic variables, anthropisation negatively affected the reproductive rate, population density and the extinction probability with time-lag responses of 20, 30 and 130 years, respectively, and caused an extinction debt of 22%. Conclusions We provide an understanding of how changes in animal movement driven by land-use changes can translate into lagged impacts on demography and, ultimately, on population viability. Implementation of proactive mitigation management are needed to promote landscape connectivity, especially for long-lived species for which first signatures of an extinction debt may arise only after decades.

AB  - Although the insular distribution of the rich herpetofauna of Greece has been studied more extensively, the mainland one is still underexplored. The region of Attica in central Greece represents one of these "black spots" in the mainland. Thus, in 2019 we surveyed for the first time the herpetofauna of Attica in a systematic way. We collected 794 field records of 31 species (4 amphibians, 27 reptiles); Testudo graeca and Trachemys elegans were documented for the first time for Attica.

AB  - In order to evaluate prevalence and intensity of apicomplexan hemoparasites in free-ranging reptiles from Romania, blood smears were collected from European pond turtles (Emys orbicularis), sand lizards (Lacerta agilis), and spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca). All three host species were positive for blood parasites, with prevalence of infected individuals between 60.71% and 100% and variable intensity. Similarities and differences with other epidemiological data are discussed.

AB  - Two species of pinworm, parasites of Testudo graeca Linneaus, 1758 from Morocco, are described: Tachygonetria poulini sp. nov. and Tachygonetria settatensis sp. nov. Light and scanning electron microscopy studies revealed morphological differences in the structure of the cephalic end in both sexes, as well as in the structure of the caudal end in the male, which enabled us to differentiate these species from others, and from each other. The relationships among the species of the genus Tachygonetria are discussed.

AB  - - Sexual dimorphism, growth and maturation patterns of Testudo g. graeca in the Central Jbilets, Morocco. - Sexual size dimorphism and the growth and maturation patterns were studied in the Mediterranean Spur-thighed Tortoise (Testudo g. graeca), in the central Jbilets mountains (western Morocco). The number and width of scute growth annuli were respectively used as indicators of age at sexual maturity and of juvenile growth rates. Males reach their sexual maturity earlier than females but juvenile growth rates do not differ between sexes. Thence, when reaching sexual maturity males are smaller than females. However, important age and size inter-individual variations were observed at maturity. In both sexes, precocious individuals show high juvenile growth rates but reach a smaller body size at maturity than late individuals. Therefore, sexual maturity depends on juvenile growth rates. The important individual variations in age and size at maturity could reflect the plasticity of individual growth and maturation in response to changing environmental conditions.

AB  - The Olive Ridley marine turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea) is characterized by individual morphological variability in the number and shape of scutes. The influence of pollutants on developmental instability and one of its consequences, the asymmetry of individuals, has been demonstrated in several species, especially invertebrates and some birds. However, the use of this asymmetry as a biomarker of contamination in adult individuals has never been explored. We developed an index to quantify developmental instability (DIx) based on the number and relative size of costal carapace scutes. The link between DIx and inorganic elements concentrations was explored in various tissues of stranded turtles from the Southern Mexican Pacific. The relationships between adult contamination and DIx could directly or indirectly reflect (i) the disruption of metal elimination in the adult stage dependent on embryonic perturbation and thus determining DIx, (ii) the difference in metal absorption dependent on DIx status, or (iii) DIx linked to other unknown factors.

AB  - The turtles of the Caucasus are poorly studied, and basic data on their geographic distribution in some Caucasian regions are poorly collated, hard to access, or entirely lacking. We present a comprehensive review of turtle localities in such a region, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (Artsakh), based on literature records, personal observations, and museum specimens. The compiled data for the 3 native species (Emys orbicularis, Mauremys caspica, and Testudo graeca) show that their distributions in this region are restricted to 3 areas of low elevation. In the northeast, turtles can be found in the Kura River drainage. In the south and west, turtles can be found in the Arax River drainage. The distributions of species within these areas vary, with E. orbicularis being the most restricted by elevation. We note that the 3 regions here form part of an important transect from the interior Arax drainage (in the Ararat region of western Armenia) to near its confluence with the Kura drainage (in southern Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh) to the Kura drainage sensu stricto (in northeast Armenia). Future studies of turtles in these areas will play an important role in understanding the historical biogeography of Caucasian turtles.

AB  - Tortoises of the genus Testudo living in Italy are Testudo hermanni, Testudo graeca and Testudo marginata. Although a great deal of information has been acquired on the internal medicine and surgery on these animals, little is known of their parasitological fauna. A survey on the presence of gastro-intestinal parasitic nematodes in tortoises bred in Italy was carried out to acquire extensive epidemiological data. Stool samples of 62 tortoises (37 T. hermanni hermanni, 13 T. graeca, 6 T. hermanni boettgeri and 6 T. marginata) were macroscopically examined and subjected to qualitative (flotation and Baermann techniques) and quantitative (McMaster technique) microscopic examinations. Adult nematodes were identified using morphological keys. Eggs of oxyurids (species indistinguishable) and adults of Alaeuris numidica, Mehdiella microstoma, Mehdiella uncinata, Tachygonetria longicollis, Tachygonetria conica and Tachygonetria palearcticus (Oxyurida, Pharyngodonidae); larvae and adults of Atractis dactyluris (Ascaridida, Atractidae); and eggs and adults of Angusticaecum holopterum (Ascaridida, Ascarididae) were identified in all animals >1 year, whereas all tortoises <1 year of age were parasite-free. Moreover, this study reports for the first time A. numidica and M. microstoma in T. marginata. This work shows that nematodes affecting tortoises are diffused in Italy and highlights the need to investigate their epidemiology more in depth.

AB  - We searched for patterns in the local abundance of Testudo graeca graeca with respect to relief characteristics in south-east Spain. The detection of tortoises during linear transects, in sampling plots and through fortuitous observations was used to examine distribution in relation to aspect and to topographic position at two different local scales. Both aspect and run-off gradients produced spatial patterns in the local abundance of T. g. graeca. These patterns are discussed with regard to the key conditions and resources for the species (solar radiation, food and nesting sites). At both scales tortoises were more abundant on north-west facing slopes, where solar radiation levels are assumed to be moderate to high, and where there are probably plenty of food resources. The apparent avoidance of north-cast facing slopes, despite an abundance of food, suggests that tortoises may not be able to thermoregulate adequately in these areas and that thermoregulation may be the most important requirement for the species. Valley bottoms, mainly occupied by non-irrigated crops, were also selected. Therefore, our results suggest that there is a spatially aggregated population structure at a local scale that is caused by factors associated with relief.

KW  - HARDERIAN-GLAND
AB  - The orbital glands of the chelonians Pseudemys scripta and Testudo graeca were investigated at the histological, histochemical and ultrastructural levels. Four acinar cell types were seen in the harderian gland of P. scripta on the basis of histochemical reactions and ultrastructure. Secretory granules were of 2 types, one showing moderate electron density with an electronlucent core, the other being smaller and more osmiophilic with an electron-dense core. In the harderian gland of T. graeca only 2 glandular cell types were found; one type contained secretory granules with a dense core surrounded by a wide zone of lower density. Acinar cells of the anterior lacrimal gland in both species were of 2 types, one being of mucous type. In the harderian gland and in the lacrimal gland of both species, one cell type appeared not to be involved in the secretion of organic material. These cells contained numerous tightly packed mitochondria among which were abundant clumps of glycogen; the cell membrane was specialised at both edges. This cell type was similar ultrastructurally to the 'salt cells' described in the salt-secreting glands of various marine vertebrates, i.e. of the cells involved in transport processes.
   These combined histological, histochemical and ultrastructural studies have allowed us to distinguish orbital glands. In the past, the harderian and lacrimal glands in chelonians have often been mistaken for one another.

AB  - The authors diagnosed primary adenocarcinoma while dissecting a spur-tighed tortoise carcass. In the tumour tissue secondary squamous metaplasia was also observed, as the first reported case in this species. Due to the adenocarcinoma of the parathyroid gland, the concentration of parathyroid hormone in the blood increased, which resulted in the extraction of inorganic matrix substances from the bony tissue of the carapace and plastron. To identify the tumour type and to characterise its behaviour immunohistochemical assays routinely used in human diagnostics - such as Ki-67 and PAN-cytokeratine - were applied by the authors.

AB  - Recognition of familiar individuals is important for modulating social interactions, but it is not clear to what extent this capacity depends on experience gained through repeated interactions with different animals. In wild tortoises, evidence of social interactions is limited to behaviours performed years after hatching, in the context of mating. To investigate the capacity to recognize familiar individuals at the onset of life in tortoises, we used hatchlings of two species (Testudo marginata, Testudo graeca) reared with a single conspecific as their unique social experience. When in a novel environment with the familiar conspecific, tortoises reached the distance expected after running random trajectories. In contrast, tortoises tested with an unfamiliar conspecific first explored the other tested individual, then actively kept a distance from it significantly larger than expected by chance. These results show evidence of spontaneous recognition of familiar individuals in a nonsocial species at the onset of life, and active avoidance of unfamiliar conspecifics. We suggest that this predisposition might be adaptive for young tortoises' dispersal and that evolutionary pressures for social behaviour might be relevant for nonsocial species even at the onset of life.

AB  - In April 2008, 585 tortoises illegally imported into Italy from North Africa were examined for the presence of ticks. Of these, 221 tortoises (37.8%) were infested with a mean intensity of 3.9 +/- 3.1 ticks (range 1-17 ticks). A total of 798 ticks (672 males, 125 females and one nymph) were collected and identified as Hyalomma aegyptium (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae). The overall male : female ratio observed was 5 : 1. The prevalence and mean intensity [+/- standard deviation (SD)] of ticks were higher among male (67.4%, 4.0 +/- 3.2) than female (55.6%, 3.8 +/- 3.1) tortoises, although this difference was not significant. By contrast, the prevalence and mean intensity of ticks were significantly higher on tortoises weighing > 100 g (61.5%, 4.0 +/- 3.2) compared with tortoises weighing < 100 g (12.1%, 2.1 +/- 1.1). Of the infested tortoises, 89.8% had ticks on their hind limbs, 21.0% on forelimbs, 18.6% on the tail and pre-anal area, and 4.8% on the head; thus the hind limbs were evidently the preferred attachment site. The present report highlights the need to develop surveillance systems to prevent the introduction and spreading of exotic ticks and tick-borne pathogens in Italy and other European countries.

AB  - The study is devoted to detection of the phylogenetic relationships between nine specimens of turtles. Five species of them are sea turtles and included in family Chelonidae (Caretta caretta, Chelonia mydas, Eretmochelys imbricata, Lepidochelys olivacea) and family Dermochelyidae (Dermochelys coriacea). Another two species are terrestrial and placed in family Testudinidae (Testudo kleinmanni and Testudo graeca). The other turtle is fresh water turtle and grouped in family Trioychidae (Trionyx triunguis). The last turtle is asemiaquatic turtle and belonging to the family Emydidae (Trachemys scripta elegans). A total of 18 blood samples were collected from turtles in different localities of Egypt. Analyses of partial mitochondrial and nuclear sequences have revealed phylogenetic inconsistencies within family Cheloniidae and regarding the placement of Dermochelys coriacea. A 645 bp, 562 bp, 555 bp and 395 bp control region fragment of COI, 16S, RAG-1 and 12S was analyzed. The high percentage similarity was confirmed in GenBankfor COI, RAG-1, 16S and 12S sequences with 99%-100%. Maximum Likelihood was used to construct a phylogenetic tree. The results showed also the position of Dermochelyidae as sister to the rest of the studied marine turtles. This study succeeded in amplification by using the DNA target of the control region and it will be useful for the conservation management of marine turtles.

AB  - Mediterranean and Russian tortoises (Testudo spp.) are popular companion animals (pets), despite ongoing controversy concerning privately keeping reptiles. The arguments used during these controversial discussions have often been based on outdated facts. Therefore, a survey was developed to evaluate the current population structure, husbandry conditions, diet regime, and health status of Testudo species in captivity. More than 75% of the 1075 respondents housed their tortoises in an outdoor enclosure containing a greenhouse or cold frame, which is considered the most species-appropriate way of husbandry. Of the respondents, 67.7% fed their tortoises with the optimum diet of more than 80% grasses and weeds during the summer vegetation period. Only 8.2% of respondents owned a tortoise with a diagnosed disease. According to the results, the likelihood of tortoises developing pyramidal growth syndrome, which can be used as an indicator of the quality of tortoise husbandry, was high in tortoises kept in a terrarium and/or fed a diet of less than 80% grasses and weeds in summer. This likelihood varied among species, with a higher incidence in Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni).

AB  - Distribution pattern, prevalence and intensity of parasitaemia of heteroxenous apicomplexan blood parasite Hemolivia mauritanica and its vector tick Hyalomma aegyptium have been studied in 264 tortoises (212 Testudo graeca and 52 T. horsfieldii) throughout the Iranian territory. In T. graeca the highest prevalence and intensity of parasitaemia for H. mauritanica were recorded in the temperate mid and northern parts of the Iranian plateau, while the lowest values were found in the arid central part of Iran. No Hemolivia-positive samples were found in T. horsfieldii. Hyalomma aegyptium ticks were diagnosed in both tortoise species. The highest prevalence and intensity of infestation with H. aegyptium were recorded in western part of Iran, where climatic conditions are not so arid compared to central and eastern parts. No significant differences were found in intensity of parasitaemia of H. mauritanica between males and females. Similarly, no differences in intensity of parasitaemia were detected between different age groups (adults; more than 10 years, young; 5-10 years and juveniles; less that 5 years). Prevalence of H. mauritanica and H. aegyptium in adults was higher than in young and in juveniles. While intensity of infestation with H. aegyptium was significantly higher in adult tortoises compare to juveniles, no significant difference were found between intensity of H. aegyptium infestation in male and female tortoises.

AB  - Body mass and length data from large samples of wild Testudo graeca, T. hermanni and T. marginata in Greece were used to assess body mass condition. Mass-length relationships differed significantly between the sexes (females being heavier) and among the species (T. marginata being least heavy). Mass-length relationships for each species and sex were used to calculate the condition index (CI) log (MMt), where M is observed mass and M' is mass predicted from length, which is equal to residuals from the regression of log M on log length. It was possible to use the empirical mass-length relationships from one population of T. hermanni to calculate CI in other populations of substantially different adult size. The seasonal pattern of the CI varied with latitude, with a sharper and later peak further north, and habitat, declining more in summer at a xeric coastal site. The seasonal patterns of CI in T. graeca and T. marginata were similar, with sharper and later peaks compared to T. hermanni. These seasonal patterns of CI were related to differences in activity and food availability among species and sites. The variability of the CI was similar in all three species, with most values between -0.1 and +0.1; seasonal variation was of relatively low amplitude, with a range of about 0.05 between the highest and lowest monthly means.

AB  - Dependence of reproduction period in Grecian tortoise on climatic conditions of the year, female behaviour during egg laying, egg structure etc. are studied. Data on the egg size and weight as well as on the amount of eggs in layings are presented. The assumption on the existence of over-bearing ready for laying by the females stated in the literature is confirmed. In experiments obtaining eggs by administration of pituitrin it has been established that the over-bearing most likely is due to insufficient concentration of the hormones in the blood of females.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Due to the veterinary and medical importance of pathogens transmitted by Hyalomma aegyptium, we tested ticks removed from Testudo graeca tortoises for the presence of Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Hemolivia, Babesia and Hepatozoon. Forty-three percent of the examined adult ticks were infected with at least one agent. The most prevalent agent identified was Hemolivia mauritanica (28.6%), followed by Candidatus Midichloria mitochondrii (9.5%) and Ehrlichia spp. (4.7%). Our study reported for the first time H. mauritanica, Ehrlichia spp. and Candidatus M. mitochondrii in H. aegyptium ticks collected from pet spur-thighed tortoises, in Qatar, providing data that adds to the geographical extension of these agents.
   Tick-borne agents constitute a growing concern for human and animal health worldwide. Hyalomma aegyptium is a hard tick with a three-host life cycle, whose main hosts for adults are Palearctic tortoises of genus Testudo. Nevertheless, immature ticks can feed on a variety of hosts, representing an important eco-epidemiological issue regarding H. aegyptium pathogens circulation. Hyalomma aegyptium ticks are vectors and/or reservoirs of various pathogenic agents, such as Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Babesia and Hepatozoon/Hemolivia. Ehrlichia and Anaplasma are emergent tick-borne bacteria with a worldwide distribution and zoonotic potential, responsible for diseases that cause clinical manifestations that grade from acute febrile illness to a fulminant disease characterized by multi-organ system failure, depending on the species. Babesia and Hepatozoon/Hemolivia are tick-borne parasites with increasing importance in multiple species. Testudo graeca tortoises acquired in a large animal market in Doha, Qatar, were screened for a panel of tick-borne pathogens by conventional PCR followed by bidirectional sequencing. The most prevalent agent identified in ticks was Hemolivia mauritanica (28.6%), followed by Candidatus Midichloria mitochondrii (9.5%) and Ehrlichia spp. (4.7%). All samples were negative for Babesia spp. and Hepatozoon spp. Overall, 43% of the examined adult ticks were infected with at least one agent. Only 4.7% of the ticks appeared to be simultaneously infected with two agents, i.e., Ehrlichia spp. and H. mauritanica. This is the first detection of H. mauritanica, Ehrlichia spp. and Candidatus M. mitochondrii in H. aegyptium ticks collected from pet spur-thighed tortoises, in Qatar, a fact which adds to the geographical extension of these agents. The international trade of Testudo tortoises carrying ticks infected with pathogens of veterinary and medical importance deserves strict control, in order to reduce potential exotic diseases.

AB  - The plasma concentration of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol was measured in 13 adult Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni), seven adult spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) and two adult marginated tortoises (Testudo marginata) during 2004. They were healthy, of both sexes, and kept in captivity under natural unfiltered sunlight in southern England with no dietary sources of cholecalciferol. Blood samples were taken in March, June and August, and the concentration of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol did not vary significantly with the seasons. However, the concentrations in the female tortoises were always significantly lower than in the males.

AB  - A complex wide-range study on the haemoproteid parasites of chelonians was carried out for the first time. Altogether, 811 samples from four tortoise species from an extensive area between western Morocco and eastern Afghanistan and between Romania and southern Syria were studied by a combination of microscopic and molecular-genetic methods. Altogether 160 Haemoproteus-positive samples were gathered in the area between central Anatolia and eastern Afghanistan. According to variability in the cytochrome b gene, two monophyletic evolutionary lineages were distinguished; by means of microscopic analysis it was revealed that they corresponded to two previously described species-Haemoproteus anatolicum and Haemoproteus caucasica. Their distribution areas overlap only in a narrow strip along the Zagros Mts. range in Iran. This fact suggests the involvement of two different vector species with separated distribution. Nevertheless, no vectors were confirmed. According to phylogenetic analyses, H. caucasica represented a sister group to H. anatolicum, and both of them were most closely related to H. pacayae and H. peltocephali, described from South American river turtles. Four unique haplotypes were revealed in the population of H. caucasica, compared with seven haplotypes in H. anatolicum. Furthermore, H. caucasica was detected in two tortoise species, Testudo graeca and Testudo horsfieldii, providing evidence that Haemoproteus is not strictly host-specific to the tortoise host species.

We conducted the first large-scale study of the diets of wild Hermann's Tortoises (Testudo hermanni hermanni) and found that the study population in central Italy was strictly herbivorous. The tortoises ate primarily legume leaves and grasses in the spring, and switched to flowers and unripe fruit of Ruscus aculeatus as these became available in the autumn. There were no significant differences between the diets of males and females. Although tortoise diets included both rare and abundant plant species, they consumed abundant plant species in a higher proportion than those species occurred in the study area. However, some rare plants made up relatively large fractions of the diet, and one of the few nonnative plants (Conyza canadensis) at the study area was eaten frequently by tortoises in all seasons, despite its relative rarity. Ruscus aculeatus berries may be particularly valuable to tortoises that are about to enter hibernation; hence. T. hermanni habitat should be managed to maintain this important plant species.

AB  - A previous study on the feeding habits of Moorish tortoises in west-central Morocco suggests that these animals are selective herbivores, but the nutritional consequences have not been examined. Because of the potassium excretion load, which requires water and/or nitrogen loss, we predicted that tortoises do not have salt glands. Moorish tortoises prefer plants rich in water and protein but low in potassium (PEP index). To this end, we studied the spring diet of adult tortoises in an arid steppe in west-central Morocco during two seasons of relatively dry years (2011-2012) using feces analyses. We also estimated the relative abundance of potential food plants by stratified sampling under the canopy of jujube bushes Ziziphus lotus. We statistically compared diet to plant abundance. Finally, we assessed plant species' nutritional composition (water, crude protein, and potassium) available to tortoises. Results showed that species assemblages differed significantly between the two plant communities in both years. Nevertheless, tortoises consumed only about 5-6 and nearly the same species at the study site in 2011 and 2012, respectively. The plants consumed by the tortoises had the highest positive PEP index values indicating that there was more water and nitrogen in the food than is needed to excrete potassium.

AB  - In recent years, representatives of more than 40 families of reptiles have been studied to understand how environmental parameters affect sex determination. In this review, we summarise the distribution and taxonomic pattern of sex determining mechanisms, outline the main hypotheses of the adaptive significance of temperature sex determination (TSD), and of skewed population sex ratios. We also examine the competing hypotheses of the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved in TSD. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The generic diagnosis of Alaeuris is emended based on the study and redescription of Alaeuris numidica from the cecum of Testudo graeca collected in Settat, Morocco and of Testudo hermanni collected in Catalonia, Spain. Scanning electron microscopy studies revealed that the papillar previously described as adanal are simple lobes because of the lack of terminal nerves, and that both preanal and postanal papillae are pedunculate. These new findings allowed us to emend the diagnosis of the genus and the species. A list of species of Alaeuris with biogeographic regions and hosts is provided.

AB  - Spur-thighed tortoises, Testudo graeca, in south-western Spain lay 3-4 clutches in shallow nests from April to June. In the present study the incubation temperature of nests laid in field enclosures in April, May and June was monitored over four years. Mean daily temperature throuehout incubation averaged 27.9 degrees C, but displayed a wide daily range, with average maximum values around 41 degrees C (also in nests where hatching success was > 0), and an absolute maximum of almost 50 degrees C. Early (April) nests displayed lower mean daily temperatures than intermediate (May) and late (June) nests, although all nests reached similar high temperatures during the hottest month (July). Incubation temperatures were affected by nest vegetation cover. Incubation length varied from 67-129 days. Because the length of incubation was negatively correlated with nest temperature, early nests had longer incubation periods than intermediate and late nests. Hatching success averaged 61% and was mainly affected by variables related to maximum temperatures. Thus unsuccessful nests (i.e. no eggs hatching) were associated with higher temperatures or longer exposure to higher temperatures. Differences in hatching or nest success were not related to the nesting month, but might have been influenced by the location of the nest. Lethal temperatures for embryo development were frequently reached during July, therefore vegetation cover of the nest is likely to play an important role in avoiding deleterious nest environments.

TI  - RAPD variation in Mediterranean turtle Testudo graeca L. (Testudinidae)
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS
LA  - English
AB  - The polymerase chain reaction with arbitrary primers (RAPD-PCR) was used to study intraspecific variation in Mediterranean turtle Testudo graeca, which is represented by the Dagestan (T. g. pallasi) and Nikolskii (T. g. nikolskii) subspecies in Russia. To study the phylogenetic relationships, the RAPD variation was also compared in two other T. graeca subspecies (T. g. ibera and T. g. terrestris), two closely related Testudo species (T. kleinmanni and T. marginata), and Central Asian turtle Agrionemys horsfieldii. Parameters of RAPD variation showed that the sample from different geographical regions of Dagestan was more polymorphic and heterogeneous than that from Central Asia. The two samples differed in the mean number of RAPD fragments N (48.76 vs. 40.40), number of polymorphic fragments P (78.7 vs. 32.3), and within-group similarity index APS (0.607 vs. 0.784). In T. g. pallasi, no significant difference in N, P, or APS was observed between samples from different localities of Dagestan or between groups of turtles with four- or five-clawed forelegs. A dendrogram of genetic similarity between the species and subspecies under study contained two clusters, one comprising all A. horsfieldii individuals and the other, all turtles of the genus Testudo. In the latter, T. marginata and T. kleinmanni showed higher similarity to each other than to T. graeca. The four T. graeca subspecies clustered separately from each other with a high reliability, T. g. nikolskii and T. g. ibera (Turkey) being more similar to each other than to T. g. terrestris or T. g. pallasi. The possible causes of the presence of four claws on forelegs of turtles from Dagestan and the relationships among members of the genus Testudo were discussed.

AB  - Contact zones are considered as windows into the evolutionary process, allowing identification of factors influencing the evolutionary forces. Here, we combined phylogenetic and morphometric analyses to explore the evolutionary process affecting the taxonomic pattern of two subspecies of Testudo graeca (T. g. buxtoni and T. g. zarudnyi) across their contact zone in Central Iran. Our results showed high levels of phylogeographic and phenotypic variation in the contact zone. Two monophyletic clades including, clade 1 (T. g. zarudnyi) and clade 2 (T. g. buxtoni) were identified. Furthermore, four distinct subclades were found in T. g. buxtoni, across a wide geographic range. Divergence time analysis suggests that the two subspecies diverged from one another after the uplifting of the Zagros Mountains during the early Pliocene. Using neutrality tests and mismatch distribution analysis, we found no evidence of recent population expansion. Morphological associations among geographical populations in the contact zone found more distinctions, with some significant adaptive and non-adaptive morphological variations in these populations. These distinctive morphological populations can be considered as management units (MUs) to conserve the evolutionary potential of this species. Finer scale evolutionary studies are required to address the southern part of the Zagros mountain range, where the overlapping of mitochondrial clades and subclades has occurred. Such information is essential for effective conservation of T. graeca populations, preventing translocation or mixing of individuals without comprehensive genetic and morphological assessment.

AB  - Temperature-dependent sex determination has been described in turtles, crocodilians, lizards and sphenodons. In such amniotes, sexual phenotype is determined based on the incubation temperature during embryonic development. The description of temperature-dependent sex determination has often been purely qualitative, without any statistical inference. A new statistical method describing temperature-dependent sex determination with two parameters, the pivotal temperature and the transitional range of temperature producing both sexes, has been developed. The estimates and their standard deviation are produced using maximum likelihood. This method is applied using data from the literature.

AB  - Clinical health checks including blood testing before brumation in fall are an important tool in reptile medicine and help to reduce the risk of complications during brumation. Electrophoresis may be useful for the evaluation of liver cell function and the detection of antigenic stimulation. The goal of this study was to compare species-specific reference intervals for plasma chemistry analytes and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) for a variety of pet chelonian species in fall. Lithium heparinized samples were collected from 68 clinically healthy spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca), 79 red-eared sliders (Trachemys scnpta elegans), and 30 map turtles (Graptemys spp.) from September to November 2016 and 2017. During the same period, 128 equivalent samples were collected from Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) and the obtained data was used for comparison. Chemistry analytes were measured from plasma using an autoanalyzer and electrophoresis was carried out by CZE. Significant variations (P < 0.0001) between the species were found for several analytes including total protein, percent albumin, and albumin : globulin ratio, alpha-, beta-, and gamma-globulin, alkaline phosphatase, glutamate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bile acids, creatine kinase, urea, uric acid, inorganic phosphorus, total calcium, and potassium. The variations in albumin (g/l) measured by CZE were also significant (P = 0.0064). No significant variations were detected for sodium levels. The results demonstrate the importance of species-specific reference intervals and provide reference intervals for the plasma chemistry and capillary zone electrophoresis in three chelonian species.

AB  - Morphology has traditionally been used to diagnose the taxa of various taxonomic ranks. However, there is growing evidence that morphology is not always able to reveal cryptic taxa, and that pronounced morphological variation could reflect phenotypic plasticity rather than evolutionary divergence. Spur-thighed tortoises (the Testudo graeca complex), distributed in the western Palaearctic region, are characterized by high morphological variability and complicated taxonomy, which are under debate. Previous molecular studies using mainly mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences have revealed incongruence between genetic differentiation and morphology-based taxonomy, suggesting that morphological variability is the result of phenotypic plasticity and stabilizing selection, which masks the true genealogies. In the present study, we used a range-wide sampling and nuclear Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers to investigate genetic differentiation within the T.?graeca complex. We found that spur-thighed tortoises are differentiated into four geographically well-defined AFLP groups: BalkansMiddle Eastern, western Mediterranean, Caucasian and central-eastern Iranian. Compared with the distribution of mtDNA lineages, the groups are largely concordant, although the AFLP markers are less sensitive and distinguish fewer groups than do mtDNA sequences. The AFLP groups show an allopatric or parapatric distribution. The AFLP differentiation conflicts with the previously proposed morphology-based taxonomy of the complex, suggesting that local adaptation to different environmental conditions may have led to the great extent of morphological variation within the same lineages. We propose a re-evaluation of the taxa that were confirmed genetically using a thorough morphological analysis corrected for phenotypic plasticity.

AB  - Dmanisi is currently the oldest Early Palaeolithic site discovered out of Africa. It has produced over 40 hominin remains, including a set of very informative skulls, in direct association with faunal remains and numerous lithic artifacts. Given the relevance of this locality, every effort is being made to reconstruct the landscapes where these hominins once lived. Amphibian and reptile remains from Dmanisi are here described for the first time and used as paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental proxies. They comprise at least six taxa: a green toad (Bufo gr. Bufo viridis), the Greek tortoise (Testudo graeca), a green lizard (Lacerta gr. Lacerta viridis), a four-lined snake (Elaphe gr. Elaphe quatuorlineata), an indeterminate colubrid and a water snake (Natrix sp.). As these taxa are not extinct and their ecology can be directly studied, they can contribute to the reconstruction of the landscape and climate. The application of the Mutual Climatic Range method provides quantitative data indicating that during the hominin presence at Dmanisi climate was warm and dry, similar to the present-day Mediterranean climate. In comparison with today climate of Dmanisi, estimated mean annual temperature was 3.1 degrees C higher, with a greater increase of temperature in summer (+7.1 degrees C) than in winter (+4.7 degrees C). The mean annual precipitation was slightly lower (-65 mm) than the current level, with precipitation higher than current one during winter (+104 mm) but strongly lower during the other seasons, suggesting a stronger contrast in the rainfall regime during the year. From a paleoenvironmental point of view, fossil amphibians and reptiles all suggest the predominance of arid environments, from steppe or semi-desert to open Mediterranean forest, with stony or rocky substrate and bushy areas. The presence of permanent aquatic environments is also documented. These results mainly agree with those for large mammals, small mammals and the archaeobotanical analysis that indicate an important water stress suggesting a period of increased aridity contemporaneous with human occupations of the site.

AB  - Objective: A disease is described in juvenile tortoises (Testudo graeca and Geochelone elegans) consisting mainly of a soft carapace, soft plastron and deformed skeleton. The aim of this study was to deter, mine histopathological lesions and the biological properties of the isolated viruses. Materials and methods: Clinical signs and gross pathology were determined on diseased and healthy appearing tortoises. Paraffin sections were stained with HE, PAS and Prussian Blue and histologically examined. Terrapene heart (TH-1) cell cultures served for virus isolations from 64 tissues and 104 swabs. One isolate (isolate 1243/37 tongue) was used in neutralization tests on 19 sera. Results: Retarded growth and increasingly soft plastron and carapace were the prominent signs in diseased tortoises. Pathological lesions consisted of dilated urinary sac, enlarged kidneys and livers. Hist . pathologically, hepatic hemosiderosis, hypoplastic anaemia, congestive glomerulonephrosis and osteodystrophy were seen. A novel virus ("virus X") was isolated from 64 organs and 79 of 104 swabs. The isolated viruses were identified as a novel chelonid picornavirus based on cytopathic effect, resistance to chloroform and stability at low pH. Co-cultivation with 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine and actinomycin D did not reduce virus titres. Electron microscopically, round, non-enveloped particles (25-30 nm) were detected. Neutralizing antibodies to the isolate 1243/37tongue were present in 17 of 19 sera from seven species of tortoises. Conclusion and clinical relevance: Nephropathy, osteodystrophy and virus isolations suggest a viral aetiology. Metabolic bone disease is the major differential diagnosis. Further investigations in vivo are needed to evaluate the likely effects of the picornavirus on tortoises.

AB  - The concentration of ionised calcium was measured in the plasma of 13 Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni boettgeri), nine spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca ibera), two marginated tortoises (Testudo marginata) and six Horsfield's tortoises (Testudo horsfieldi) maintained under natural unfiltered sunlight in the UK. The numbers were too small to analyse the differences between the species, sexes or the time of the year statistically, but the concentrations of ionised calcium were generally higher in all the tortoises in the samples taken in August than in the samples taken in March and June.

AB  - The acoustics of an authentically reconstructed ancient Greek tortoise-shell lyre, known as Chelys, is investigated for the first time. Modern experimental methods are employed, such as electronic speckle pattern laser interferometry and impulse response, to extract the vibrational behavior of the instrument and its main parts. Additionally, the emitted sound from the instrument was recorded, under controlled conditions, and spectrally analyzed. Major findings include the concentration of the emitted sound between 400 Hz and 800 Hz, with an amplitude modified in a manner consistent with the experimentally measured vibrational characteristics of the instrument's sound box and bridge. The experimental results validate the historical evidence that Chelys was used in Greek antiquity as an accompaniment instrument to the human voice. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Individual variability of bony carapace in four species of turtles (Mauremys caspica, Emys orbicularis, Testudo graeca, Agrionemys horsfieldi) was studied. Various bony anomalies were observed in 121 of 510 studied specimens. MorPhogenetic causes of abnormal development are discussed. According to these causes all anomalies are divided into three groups: anomalies caused by deviations in the axial skeleton (variation in the number of neurals and costals); anomalies caused by anomal development of the horny shields (variation in the number of peripherals, modifications of the shape of neurals and costals in Testudinidae); anomalies caused by irregular osteogenesis in the derma or by deviations in the growth of bones (variation in the number of suprapygals, formation of accessory dermal plates, fusion of regular ossifications),

AB  - Previous data have shown that the Former Yugoslavia had a significant role in exports of land tortoises (Testudo spp.) during the past century. In this paper we present historical exploitation and compare dynamics of the trade in land tortoises in the former Yugoslavia according to Federal Statistical Office and Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) database. Also we examine impact of long-term harvesting on the health of populations by calculating the condition index (CI) in the sample populations of the most common tortoise in the former Yugoslavia (Testudo hermanni). According to the Federal Statistical Office's records of international trade, a total of 2615 metric tonnes of tortoises (T. hermanni and T. graeca) were exported from the Former Yugoslavia within a 41-year period during the 20th century. These exports represented a total of 2.142 million specimens. The quantities of tortoises exported peaked at a value of 236 tons in 1972. Since 1929, tortoises have been exported to 19 countries. The largest importers were Germany, Italy, Belgium-Luxembourg and Great Britain. These countries accounted for 77% of the total exports. We found many discrepancies between official Federal records and CITES records for the period from 1975 onwards. Differences were found in the quantities exported, the identities of the importing counties and their relative shares of the total export of tortoises. The current optimal CI values in examined tortoises suggest a response to overharvesting through density-dependent processes. The paper discusses a current situation in tortoise farming and trade and further perspectives on conservation of tortoise populations in the region of the former Yugoslavia.

AB  - In this paper, we examine 2 case reports for different reptile-related Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serotypes. In case 1, a 5-year-old boy presented with gastroenteritis caused by S. enterica subspecies enterica serovar Poona. The suspected source of infection was a turtle kept at the patient's home. In case 2, a 4-year-old boy presented with gastroenteritis caused by S. enterica subspecies enterica serovar Abony. The Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis suggested that a tortoise kept at the patient's home was the source of infection. This paper presents a review of the literature and an examination of cases regarding turtle-associated salmonellosis in Japan.

AB  - Many enzootic life cycles involving wild animals and non-nidicolous ixodids are still unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to report the identified tick species collected from seven different animal species (red deer, brown bear, gray wolf, Eurasian lynx, red fox, European hare, and Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise) living in the wild in Turkey and to investigate the presence of a wide range of tick-borne microorganisms in the tick samples obtained from these animals. The collected ticks (n = 98) were identified asDermacentor reticulatus,Haemaphysalis parva,Hyalomma aegyptium,Hyalomma excavatum,Hyalomma marginatum,Ixodes ricinus, andRhipicephalus turanicus. All engorged ticks collected from the wild animals and unfed larvae (n = 30) obtained from a singleRh. turanicusfemale were also analyzed individually for tick-borne bacterial and protozoan agents via PCR-sequencing. The molecular analyses revealed the presence ofBabesiasp. tavsan2,Theileria capreoli, fourHepatozoonspp. (Hep. ursi,Hep. canis,Hep. felis, andHepatozoonsp.),Hemolivia mauritanica, and three SFG rickettsiae (CandidatusRickettsia barbariae,Ca. R. goldwasserii, andRickettsia hoogstraalii) in the collected ticks. This represents the first report ofTh. capreoli,Hep. ursi, andCa. R. barbariaein ticks from Turkey. The evolutionary relationships of microbes in the different host and tick species are also discussed. Multiple novel tick-host associations in the tick life cycle were also revealed.

AB  - Cellular infiltrations forming lymphoid-like aggregates were previously observed in gonads of two turtle species exhibiting temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD): at hatching in Chelydra serpentina; at and after hatching in Emys orbicularls. We show here that such aggregates are also present in gonads of Testudo graeca by the end of embryonic development, suggesting that their occurrence is general in turtles. Since in C. serpentina, infiltrations were observed mainly in testes exhibiting remnants of the germinal epithelium, it was assumed that their occurrence was an expression of maleness leading to rejection of this epithelium. The generality of this hypothesis was tested in E. orbicularis by looking for lymphoid-like aggregates in three types of gonads (testes, ovotestes, and ovaries) and for the stages at which they occur. Gonads were from embryos, hatchlings, and young incubated at various temperatures. Ovotestes obtained by treatment with an aromatase inhibitor of eggs incubated at female-producing temperature were also examined. In these gonads, the differentiation of Sertoli cells in testicular cords/tubes was ascertained by expression of SOX9. Moreover, the cell composition of aggregates was determined on electron micrographs. Aggregates appear in ovaries and ovotestes by the end of embryonic development and are present in the majority of these gonads at hatching, and at least up to one year after hatching. They are composed mainly of lymphocytes and fibroblasts. Aggregates are not present in typical testes. Since they occur in most ovaries, they cannot be seen as an expression of maleness. Rather, lymphocytic infiltration and formation of lymphoid aggregates in turtle gonads can be seen as components of the immune system, and can be under the control of gonadal endogenous sex steroids.

AB  - Objective: Tortoise picornavirus (ToPV) has been speculated to play an important role in the frequently seen disease pattern of juvenile shell softening. This study aimed to determine ToPV prevalence among German tortoise collections. Material and methods: A total of 334 animals selected from 27 different collections were included. Seven species of four genera of the family Testudinidae (Testudo graeca, T. hermanni, T. marginata, T. horsfieldii, Centrochelys sulcata, Stigmochelys pardalis, Chelonoidis carbonarius) were sampled. The tortoises were clinically investigated and none of the adults showed any signs of shell softening. Seven hatchlings of a ToPV-positive T. graeca breeding pair showed retarded growth and a progressive shell weakness that resulted in death. Each animal was sampled by conjunctival, pharyngeal and cloacal swabs (990 swabs in total) and blood sampling (293 in total). All three swabs of one animal were pooled and tested by reverse transcriptase polymerise chain reaction (RT-PCR) for tortoise picornavirus RNA. Blood samples were investigated by virus neutralisation test (VNT) for specific anti ToPV antibodies. All titres equal to or higher than log(2) = 2 were considered positive. Results: In total, 35 adult and 11 juvenile animals were tested positive for ToPV RNA. The serological investigation did detect specific antibodies against ToPV in 44 adult tortoises and one juvenile. In total, 76 animals were tested positive in either one of the investigations, 16 animals in both. The highest number of ToPV-positive animals was found for T. graeca, with a prevalence of 32 %. No specimens of C. carbonarius, C. sulcata, or S. pardalis were tested positive. Conclusion and clinical relevance: The results propose a predisposition in T graeca, as well as a high prevalence of ToPV in T. graeca, whereas other species showed only single or no positive animals, but may function as virus carriers.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of the present study was to purify and characterize classic pancreatic lipase from the reptile turtle (TuPL).
   Methods: The lipase was purified from the fresh pancreas extract followed by diethylamino ethyl-cellulose chromatography, Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration, and a Mono-Q Sepharose chromatography.
   Results: Turtle pancreatic lipase is a serine enzyme and it contains only 1 free cysteine. Its activity is maximum at pH 8.2 and 37 degrees C. A specific activity of 10.000 U/mg and 5.000 U/mg were measured titrimetrically on tributyrin and olive oil emulsion, respectively. Natural detergents act as potent inhibitors of TuPL, and colipase restores the activity. When the lipase is inhibited by synthetic detergent, simultaneous addition of colipase and bile salts is required to restore the TuPL activity. The critical surface pressure of TuPL (pi(c) = 20.9 mN m(-1)) is similar to the one of human PL (pi(c) = 18 mN m(-1)).
   Conclusions: The results presented in this article indicate that despite the primitive character of the turtle, no significant difference has been observed between TuPL and known mammalian PLs. However, partial proteolysis of TuPL with chymotrypsin shows the absence of the 14-kDa fragment identified as the C-terminal domain in the case of many classic PLs.

AB  - In many species of reptiles, sex is determined at fertilization by zygotic sex chromosome composition. In other species, including all crocodilians, most turtles and some lizards, sex is determined by temperature during the earlier stages of gonadal differentiation. The effects of exogenous estrogens, antiestrogens and aromatase inhibitors at different temperatures have unambiguously demonstrated the involvement of estrogens in sexual differentiation of the gonads. Aromatase is the enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens. Gonadal aromatase activity is well correlated with gonadal structure. It increases exponentially in differentiating ovaries, whereas it remains low in differentiating testes. Moreover, there is a high correlation between the thermosensitive periods for both ovary differentiation and increase in aromatase activity. We suggest that a thermosensitive factor intervenes, directly or indirectly, in the transcriptional regulation of the aromatase gene in reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination.

Packed cell volume (PCV), haemoglobin concentration (Hb), red and white blood cell counts (RBC and WBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and leucocyte differential counts were determined during the different phases of the hibernation cycle.
   2. Normal reptilian ranges of PCV, Hb, RBCs and WBCs were recorded.
   3. In response to cold stress, values of PCV, Hb, RBCs, MCV, MCH and MCHC fell significantly.
   4. The ESR also decreased in response to cold related to an increased vasoconstriction and blood viscosity.
   5. The WBCs were maximum during mid-hibernation, but started to decline after arousal. However, differential counts showed specific seasonal pattern for each type of leucocytes.

AB  - Most of the 40 species of tortoises are experiencing population declines. Of the various causes of mortality in wild populations of tortoises, the interactions of disease and population dynamics are least understood. Although habitat degradation is considered the most significant threat to wild populations of tortoises, disease is being observed more frequently in certain populations. An upper respiratory tract disease has been seen in populations of desert tortoise, Gopherus agassizi, in the Mojave Desert, USA, and certain populations of the gopher tortoise, Gopherus polyphemus, in Florida, USA. Much more information is available on diseases of captive tortoises than on those of wild tortoises. Of infectious diseases, viral, bacterial, mycotic, and parasitic diseases have all been reported. Noninfectious diseases identified in tortoises include various nutritional diseases, hypothyroidism, and neoplasia. Virtually nothing is known about the effects of pollutants/toxicants in individual or populations of tortoises.

Population density varied between 0.7 and 2.15 ind./ha. An historical analysis of the habitat formation and divergence of the Horsfield tortoise on the Iranian Plateau is given. Information on morphology, ecology and parasitology of the populations from the environs of Mazdavand is presented. The morphometric characteristics of two populations were compared and some morphometric indices were found. The possible co-occurrence of Agrionemys horsfieldii and Testudo graeca zarudnyi is discussed. These two species show a preference for different conditions and rarely meet together in the same habitat.

AB  - A 42-year-old female Testudo graeca was referred with a five-month history of a non-healing carapacial wound. Previous treatment had involved long-term antibiotic therapy and conscious debridement of necrotic tissue. On presentation an extensive deep wound with purulent discharge was visible on the right side of the carapace. A computed tomographic scan was performed to assess the extent of the wound. This revealed a large carapacial deficit with two underlying soft tissue masses. Surgical debridement was performed under general anaesthesia resulting in an even larger defect. Because of the extensive nature of the deficit, negative pressure wound therapy was applied to aid wound healing. A negative pressure of approximately 120mmHg was maintained and bandages were changed every third day. Wound healing progressed rapidly and a healthy granulation bed was formed within 16 days.

AB  - Blood smears from wild-caught, long-term captive tortoises, Testudo marginata, revealed the presence of gametocytes of a Hemolivia mauritanica-like hemogregarine in the erythrocytes of 72% tortoises examined. Significant parasitemia was also found in animals living several years in captivity. Experimentally infected tortoises showed no evidence of a decrease in parasitemia level more than 15 mo after infection. Morphologically, stages found in tortoises' erythrocytes were indistinguishable from those referred to by previous workers as H. mauritanica from Testudo graeca. Moreover, successful experimental transmission to Hyalomma aegyptium confirms the conspecificity with H. mauritanica. The occurrence of H. mauritanica gametocytes in tortoise living up to 8 yr in captivity is suggested to result from continuous, long-lasting cyclic merogony in tortoises' parenchymatous organs, which is an unknown phenomenon in the life cycle of Hemolivia spp.

AB  - Eighteen Greek tortoises (Testudo hermanni), divided into three groups, were kept at three different average ambient temperatures. Gastrografin((R)) was administered to all individuals by orogastric tube at a dosage of 1 ml/130 g body weight. The partial and total transit times were recorded by means of radiographs taken immediately postadministration and at 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, and 150 min and 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr postadministration. Mean total transit times were 2.6 hr (range 1.5-4.0 hr) at 30.6 degrees C, 6.6 hr (range 3.0-8.0 hr) at 21.5 degrees C, and 17.3 hr (range 8.0-24.0 hr) at 15.2 degrees C. These transit times allow a radiologic diagnosis within a relatively short period, especially compared with contrast studies performed with barium sulfate. The visualization of the intestinal tract is good with Gastrografin((R)); however, intestinal mucosal detail was not completely satisfactory.

AB  - The Goravan Sands Sanctuary is an important Armenian wildlife conservation area. The objectives of my study were to assess habitat suitability for reptiles within the sanctuary by comparing species richness, total abundance and species diversity across 35 random quadrats. I present the mean abundance data of 5 reptiles: Phrynocephalus persicus, Eremais pleskei, Eremias strauchi, Lacerta strigata and Testudo graeca. Maps of the relatively uncommon lizard P. persicus reflect species richness patterns whereas maps of the most abundant lizard E pleskei more accurately reflect total reptile abundance and species diversity. About 71 % of the area of the patches is covered with regions of high and moderate species diversity suitable for reptile inhabitation. Fourteen percent of the area is covered with patches of low diversity. The moderate and highly suitable patches are recommended for intensive conservation management planning.

AB  - The ontogenetic development of shell was studied in three turtle species: Testudo graeca (Testudinidae), Emys orbicularis (Emydidae), Trionyx sinensis (Trionychidae). Individual bony plates are found to form only from one source. This fact is contradictory to the hypothesis of a complex origin of shell plates due to the fusion of basal skeletal elements and osteoderms. More probably, the shell has been formed resulted from a reduction of primary trunk dorsal and ventral osteoderms. This process was accompanied with expansion of basal bones (ribs, neural arches, bones of a shoulder girdle, and gastrals) in dermis. Hence, carapace and plastron appeared. Osteodermal peripheral plates connected them to the unique armored structure of turtle shells, Paedomorphosis as an instrument of evolutionary development is not characteristic of turtles. The morphogenetic data confirm phylogenetic hypotheses about the saltation origin of turtles and their close relation with Pareiasauria.

AB  - Demographic analyses suggest that chelonians will have a low ability to withstand harvesting, although most have been based on stationary or declining populations. In contrast to this prediction, a population of Testudo graeca grew at the instantaneous rate r = 0.137 from 1980-1990, with a doubling time of 5 years. r was similar in both adult and 10 cm animals, showing that this high rate was not due to changes in population structure, and may thus be taken as an intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)). r(m) was higher than that of most large mammals, and suggests that sustainable harvesting would be a viable conservation strategy for chelonians if tightly regulated. Ranching or farming operations for chelonians would be even more likely to succeed, given their high fecundity. A resumption of trade in Mediterranean tortoises is, however, unlikely to be economically sustainable.

AB  - The global trade in tortoises of the genus Testudo was reviewed by using compiled import data from Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) for 1975-2005. A total of 58 importing and 112 exporting countries were recorded as being involved with the Testudo trade. Turkey, the former Soviet Union, the former Yugoslavia, Morocco, Uzbekistan, Russia, and Ukraine accounted for 81% of the recorded exports; whereas, the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States dominated the import market with 67% of the individuals. Testudo horfieldi accounted for 48% of the exports, followed by Testudo graeca (37%) and Testudo hermanni (13%). A total of 2,062,289 individuals were traded internationally, and of these, 99% were live animals. Of the animals from known sources, 67% were from the wild, and 16% were allegedly captive bred; the source of 70% of all declared trade animals was unknown.

AB  - Simple Summary Understanding the energy that animals use to move around is important, as it can shed light on how they make decisions about where and how to locomote. Tortoises are unique among vertebrates in having a shell, which influences almost all aspects of their biology. Here, we experimentally quantified the metabolic cost of transport in Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoises walking on a treadmill while also quantifying the kinematics of their movement. We found, in line with previous studies, that tortoises move more efficiently than predicted and present the first data demonstrating a curvilinear cost of transport over their speed range. We conclude that tortoises have an optimum speed at which they move to minimise their metabolic cost of locomotion. Tortoises are famed for their slow locomotion, which is in part related to their herbivorous diet and the constraints imposed by their protective shells. For most animals, the metabolic cost of transport (CoT) is close to the value predicted for their body mass. Testudines appear to be an exception to this rule, as previous studies indicate that, for their body mass, they are economical walkers. The metabolic efficiency of their terrestrial locomotion is explainable by their walking gait biomechanics and the specialisation of their limb muscle physiology, which embodies a predominance of energy-efficient slow-twitch type I muscle fibres. However, there are only two published experimental reports of the energetics of locomotion in tortoises, and these data show high variability. Here, Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) were trained to walk on a treadmill. Open-flow respirometry and high-speed filming were simultaneously used to measure the metabolic cost of transport and to quantify limb kinematics, respectively. Our data support the low cost of transport previously reported and demonstrate a novel curvilinear relationship to speed in Testudines, suggesting tortoises have an energetically optimal speed range over which they can move in order to minimise the metabolic cost of transport.

AB  - Background: The tissue growth necessary to achieve a complete or partial restitution ad integrum as a result of injury to soft tissue and/or hard times in reptiles is variable and often needs long time in relation to the species, to the habitat and to their intrinsic physiological characteristics. The purpose of this work was to see if the tissue optimization (TO) treatment with radio electric asymmetric conveyer (REAC) provided good results in these animals and whether its use translates into reduced time of tissue repair. This paper describes preliminary results with in promoting the tissue repair in reptiles.
   Cases presentation: A 5 year old male Testudo graeca (Leo) and Trachemys scripta scripta (Mir) and a 15 year old female Testudo hermanni (Juta) were evaluated because of soft tissue injuries. A female 25 year old Trachemys scripta elegans (Ice), a female 2.5 year old Trachemys scripta scripta (Penelope) as well as a 50 year old male Testudo graeca (Margherito) were evaluated because of wounds of the carapace. Following debridement and traditional therapies, Leo, Penelope and Margherito were exposed to the radio electric asymmetric conveyer (REAC) device, with a specific treatment protocol, named tissue optimization-basic (TO-B). Also Ice and Mir were subjected to REAC treatment after wounds debridement. Juta was treated only with REAC treatment.
   Complete wound healing was evident after 17 days for Leo, 7 days for Penelope, 27 days for Mir, 78 days for Ice and after 14 days for Margherito. Juta showed a considerable tissue activation in 2 days and complete wound healing in 5 days.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that REAC TO-B treatment may provide advantages over other traditional methods after complete wound healing in Leo, and also suitable healing in the other patients. Then REAC device with its specific treatment TO-B protocol, which induces tissue repair without causing severe stress to the patient, could be a potential therapy for tissue damage healing in reptiles. Further studies still need to be conducted to support our observations.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) has been used to measure population fitness as a result of genetic and environmental processes. We compared FA in carapace shape, using a novel geometric morphometric method, among four populations of Gopher Tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus), a long-lived species of conservation concern endemic to the southeastern U.S. Coastal Plain. Populations used in this study included: 1) the Wade Tract, an old-growth Longleaf Pine (Pinus palustris) forest located in southwestern Georgia, USA; 2) Gopher Island, located within the Chattahoochee River basin at the Alabama-Georgia border, USA; 3) Conecuh National Forest, located in southcentral Alabama, USA; and 4) a mitigation-recipient site in southeastern Mississippi, USA. Based on prior studies of the genetic structure of G. polyphemus populations, we predicted that the Mississippi population would have the highest FA, while the Gopher Island population would have the lowest FA. We found significant differences in FA among populations of Gopher Tortoises (H = 11.15, df = 3, P = 0.011), with the highest FA in the tortoises from Mississippi and the lowest FA in tortoises from Conecuh National Forest. We did not find a significant difference in FA between sexes (F-2,F-111 = 0.389, P = 0.679). Regression analyses indicated that across populations, size (as measured by straight-line carapace length) did not influence FA, although there was a significantly negative effect of size on FA within the Gopher Island population (t = -2.039, df = 33, P = 0.050). These results highlight the need for continued study of Gopher Tortoises and FA, especially in Mississippi, where fitness may be reduced.

AB  - The ontogenetic development of typical turtles, Emys orbicularis (Emydidae) and Testudo graeca (Testudinidae) was studied. Anlages of horny shields of shells was found to develop at the early embryonic stages as well as epidermal placodes (local thickenings of epidermis). The position of placodes is related to the body segmentation: marginals arise opposite each myoseptum, pleurals. vertebrals and possibly plastrals originate in one myoseptum. The vertebral shields result from the fusion of primary paired anlages. The position of these anlages is strictly determined by the location of the previously arisen pleural placodes. Basic morphogenetic regularities of developing the Chelonia horny shell were formed at the earliest period of their evolution and retained unchanged. The basic trend of the evolution was a decrease in the number of the horny shell elements. This process took place as a result of a reduction and fusion of shields or their anlages. The major lines of the evolutionary development of turtle shell scutation are discussed.

AB  - Between February and September 2014, we performed a survey of 23 animal markets in Beirut. Trade in wild animals including reptiles, birds and mammals comprise a large volume (25704 specimens). The estimated value of wildlife trade in Lebanon in the visited shops and during the study period is 431371 US$, out of which 97 % is for birds. This number indicates the economical importance of wildlife trade in Lebanon. Due to the high demand by the public, birds constituted the majority of the traded species which consisted mostly of cage-bred or imported species. Lebanon's biodiversity is not threatened by the trade of wild species, except for some species like the Spur-thighed tortoise. However, the risk of transmission of diseases due to trade in wildlife is evident. The prices of traded animals varied according to their conservational status, their origins (local, captive-bred, imported or smuggled), supply and demand, and specific features of species. Highest prices were observed when all factors are combined (i.e. case of the Macaw parrot). Most (64%) traded species are not listed under any appendix of CITES, only 16 species are listed under Appendix-II and one species is listed under Appendix-III. Regarding IUCN status of traded species, five species are considered vulnerable, one is endangered, one is near threatened and the rest are considered as least concern. Furthermore, most (70%) of the shops visited were in poor conditions, while shops in excellent conditions are exclusively the licensed shops. Hence, law enforcement and regulation of wildlife trade will have a positive impact on not only shop conditions, but also on animals well being, reduced degree of mortality in trade, reduced smuggling, and consequently a better conservation of wildlife in Lebanon.

AB  - Captive chelonians should be fed a natural diet to achieve a growth rate similar to that of free-ranging animals. A wide range of commercially formulated foods dedicated to chelonians is available. Feeding commercial foods has the advantage of convenience. On the other hand, species-specific information on the nutritional requirements of chelonians is not available yet. The aim of this study was to analyse and evaluate commercial pellets and feeds for chelonians. Commercial pellets (ntortoise = 7, nturtle = 7, from 6 companies) dedicated to carnivorous aquatic turtles and herbivorous terrestrial tortoises, and other aquatic turtle feeds (lyophilised beef heart, dried aquatic invertebrates, and whole frozen fish) were bought in pet shops. Whole frozen fish served as a reference feed for carnivorous aquatic turtles. The chemical composition as well as calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) contents were determined. Single-sample t-test was used with the label information as null hypothesis and the results of own parallel analyses for crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), crude fibre (CF), Ca and P. The labelling of some of the pellets was deficient as nutritive values, Ca or P data were missing (tortoise pellets: 4 out of 7; turtle pellets: 5 out of 7). The label data differed significantly (p<0.05) from the results of our own analysis for 13 out of the 14 pellets. None of the tortoise pellets met the requirements of the animals completely. Because of the inadequate Ca:P ratio only one turtle pellet could be accepted. Accordingly, none of the commercial pellets can be recommended as main or only feed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationships between total calcium and phosphorus and ionised calcium and phosphorus values in clinically healthy tortoises.
   Methods: Jugular blood samples were obtained from 25 tortoises, as part of a health screen of the population. These comprised Hermann's tortoises, Testudo hermanni boettgeri, spur-thighed tortoises, Testudo graeca ibera, marginated tortoises, Testudo marginata, and horsfield tortoises, Testudo horsfieldi. Plasma from these samples were analysed for total calcium, ionised calcium and phosphorus levels. These samples were taken in the immediate posthibernation period, before the onset of reproductive activity.
   Results: Females exhibited statistically significantly higher levels of phosphorus. Ionised calcium and total calcium levels were elevated in females compared with males, but this was not statistically significant. Females did have statistically significantly higher calculated solubility indexes and statistically significantly lower ratios compared with males.
   Clinical Significance: This study has provided an insight into the ratios and solubility indexes in tortoises, and this information may lead to further understanding of the significance of these parameters in chelonians.

TI  - Examination of death of tortoises during wintering period
T2  - MAGYAR ALLATORVOSOK LAPJA
LA  - Hungarian
AB  - In Hungary many people keep tortoises as pet animals. Their inactive winter period and the wintering cause many problems, leading often to death. The 9 examined carcases of tortoises (4 Iberian tortoises, 4 marginated tortoises and 1 Greek tortoise) died because of bad wintering conditions and consequent bacterial and parasitic disease due to decrease in resistance. On the occasion of their cases the authors call attention to preventive anthelminthic treatment and present the rules of wintering.

AB  - Temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) is a kind of sex determination in which gonadal sex is dependent on the incubation temperature of the eggs. Within reptiles, TSD occurs in many turtles, all crocodilians, the tuataras and some lizards. The European Pond Turtle, Emys orbicularis, has been the most studied species for TSD, and the biochemistry of TSD is well-understood in this species. However, predicting the sex ratio when incubation temperature is not constant remains challenging. Here we propose a new methodology to predict the sex ratio for natural nests, and we apply this methodology to eggs of E. orbicularis incubated under natural conditions. Finally, we give recommendations on how to apply this method to other natural populations or species with TSD.

AB  - A group of approximately 370 Egyptian tortoises (Testudo kleinmanni) and 36 spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) were illegally imported into Italy from Libya. Within 6 mo of their entry into Italy, all but 40 of the Egyptian tortoises had died with signs of severe stomatitis. Herpesviruses were detected from the tongues of seven Egyptian tortoises by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and virus isolation. Sequencing of a portion of the UL39 homologue of the herpesviruses from three different tortoises demonstrated that the viruses were identical to one another and identical to a herpesvirus isolated from a Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) in Germany. This is the first description of the detection of a herpesvirus from diseased Egyptian tortoises. That these animals were imported into Europe from Libya provides circumstantial evidence for the presence of herpesviruses among tortoises in northern Africa.

AB  - Viruses occurring in turtles and tortoises are hetergeneous but according to ecologic characteristics and pathogenic properties they can be divided in two major groups: 1. Arboviruses (toga-, flavi-, rhabdo- and bunyaviruses) transmitted by arthropods cause severe diseases in homoiothermic vertebrates. The viruses are of great epidemiological interest in human and veterinary medicine. Chelonia and other reptiles infected by bites of vectors e. g. Aedes, Anopheles, Culex develop cyclic viremia without injury. The ectothermic animals maintain inapparent arbovirus infections during hibernation and they play role as reservoirs for these viruses. 2. Viruses of Chelonia origin (papova-, herpes-, irido- and paramyxoviruses) associated with diseases of infected turtles and tortoises have been described frequently during the last 20 years. Several viruses or virus-like particles could be demonstrated in affected reptiles mainly by electron microscopy. Especially herpesviruses seem to attack Chelonia and epizootics due to infections with these viruses were reported in several reptiles in collections. However, the etiological role of the agents detected is not well documented yet.

AB  - The Island of Gavdos off the south coast of Crete (Greece) was never connected to the mainland or Crete and yet is home to six reptile species. This paper speculates about how they got there. Mauremys rivulata probably arrived at the island unaided, but the population there is now very small and endangered. With regard to the other species, the mechanisms are likely to have been passive (e. g., Hemidactylus turcicus) or active (e. g., Testudo graeca) transport. The original description of two reptile forms (Mediodactylus kotschyi kalypsae and Telescopus fallax pallidus) is based on specimens from Gavdos. However, subsequent genetic analysis suggests that the taxonomic status of M kotschyi kalypsae needs to be reassessed. In the case of T. fallax pallidus, active transport has been hypothesised. Further genetic investigations are needed to shed light on the origin of the reptiles of the Island of Gavdos.

AB  - Abnormalities and the postnatal development of the carapace were investigated in 106 captive tortoises (Testudini-dae, Testudo hermanni boettgeri, Testudo graeca, Testudo marginata, Testudo horsfieldii) using computer tomography (CT) in live animals and/or dissection of preserved specimens. The carapace was reconstructed two-dimensionally through combining sectional images. The postnatal ossification was demonstrated in 3D CT images combined with dissection results. We found that abnormal numbers and arrangements of horny scutes and bony plates may occur independently at different locations and different ontogenetic stages. Abnormalities of the horny scutes are present at hatching when the bony plates are not yet fully formed. The temporal course of carapace ossification appears to be species-specific. We demonstrate that computer tomography is a non-invasive and convenient method suitable for studying abnormalities and the postnatal ossification process of the bony carapace, as well as for diagnostics in live chelonians. However, the resolution limit of the method will be reached in the case of very young or metabolically challenged subjects.

AB  - Background: Hyalomma aegyptium is a hard-tick with a typical three-host life cycle. The main hosts are Palearctic tortoises of genus Testudo. However, other hosts can be used by immature ticks for feeding in natural conditions. Given this complex ecology and multiple host use, the circulation of pathogens by H. aegyptium between various hosts can be important from epidemiological point of view. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of H. aegyptium as natural carrier of four important zoonotic pathogens.
   Methods: From 2008 to 2011, 448 H. aegyptium ticks were collected from 45 Spur-thighed tortoises, Testudo graeca in Romania. DNA was extracted individually from each tick using a commercial kit. DNA was examined for the presence of specific sequences of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia canis and Coxiella burnetii by PCR, according to previously described protocols.
   Results: PCR analysis of H. aegyptium revealed the presence of A. phagocytophilum (18.8%), E. canis (14.1%) and C. burnetii (10%). 32.4% of the ticks were infected with at least one pathogen and 9.8% had co-infections. The stages most frequently infected were nymphs (50%) followed by males (33.9%) and females (27%). The number of tortoises which harboured infected ticks was 27/45 examined (60%). From all tested T. graeca, 40% harboured ticks infected with A. phagocytophilum, 46.7% had ticks infected with E. canis and 33.3% had ticks with C. burnetii. This study reports for the first time the presence of A. phagocytophilum and E. canis in H. aegyptium.
   Conclusions: The presence and relatively high prevalence of three important zoonotic pathogens in H. aegyptium raises the question of their epidemiologic importance in disease ecology. As tortoises are unlikely to be reservoir hosts for A. phagocytophilum and E. canis and both these pathogens are common in H. aegyptium, this is an important indication for (1) a possible increased host-switching behaviour of these ticks to competent reservoir hosts (i.e. hedgehogs) and (2) transstadial transmission. Furthermore, if we consider also the presence of C. burnetii, we conclude that T. graeca and its ticks should be evaluated more seriously when assessing the eco-epidemiology of zoonotic diseases.

AB  - In recent years, it has become clear that frugivory and seed dispersal (FSD) by turtles and tortoises is much more common than previously thought. We here review published and unpublished records of chelonian FSD, and assess the role of chelonians as seed dispersers, from individual species to the community level. We first discuss the distribution of chelonian FSD and the characteristics of the fruit and/or seed species eaten and dispersed by chelonians. We then use the seed dispersal efficiency framework to explore the quantitative and qualitative components of seed dispersal by tortoises and turtles, embarking on a journey from when the fruits and/or seeds are consumed, to when and where they are deposited, and assess how efficient chelonians are as seed dispersers. We finally discuss chelonian FSD in the context of communities and of chelonians as megafauna. A substantial proportion of the world's aquatic and terrestrial turtles and a major part of testudinid tortoises (71 species in 12 families) include fruits and/or seeds in their diet; fruits of at least 588 plant species in 121 families are ingested and/or dispersed by chelonians. For some chelonians, overall or in certain seasons, fruit may even form the largest part of their diet. Contrary to seed dispersal by lizards, the other major reptilian frugivores, chelonian FSD is not an island phenomenon in terms of geographic distribution. Nevertheless, on islands tortoises are often among the largest native terrestrial vertebrates - or were until humans arrived. We synthesise our knowledge of chelonian FSD, and discuss the relevance of our findings for conservation and restoration, especially in relation to rewilding with large and giant tortoises.

AB  - Plasma total calcium, ionised calcium and albumin levels in Hermann's tortoises (Testudo, hermanni), spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca), marginated tortoises (Testudo, marginata) and Horsfield's tortoises (Testudo horsfieldi) were investigated. The animals were captive adults maintained under natural unfiltered sunlight in the UK with no dietary sources of cholecalciferol. Analysis of total calcium data showed statistically significant seasonal elevations in females in August compared with March (P=0.003), and statistically significant elevations in females compared with males at all sampling points (March P=0.036, June P=0.003 and August P<0.0001). These differences in values became more prominent as the summer progressed. Albumin values did not appear significantly affected by season. However, males had significantly higher albumin levels than females in the August samples. A correlation between total calcium and ionised calcium was confirmed but there was no correlation between total calcium and albumin values. Total calcium levels were a poor indication of ionised calcium levels, which constituted between 18 and 57 per cent of the total calcium value.

AB  - We investigated the mitochondrial phylogeography of spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) in the Western Mediterranean. In North Africa, four major lineages (A-D) Occur that together constitute a well-supported clade corresponding to one of the six major clades within T. graeca the North African clade is sister to a Caucasian clade representing the Subspecies T. g. armeniaca. Phylogenetic relationships between the North African lineages are badly resolved. Lineage A is distributed in Tunisia and adjacent Algeria, lineage B in Algeria and northern Morocco. lineage C in the Libyan Cyrenaica Peninsula, and lineage 1) north of the High Atlas Mts. and in the Souss Valley (southern Morocco). Lineage B is subdivided into two subgroups, B-1 (eastern Morocco and Algeria) and B-2 (north-western Morocco). Italian tortoises harbour haplotypes of lineage A. Spanish tortoises Of Subgroup B-1. Based on a relaxed molecular clock calibrated with fossil evidence, the six major mtDNA clades of T. graeca are estimated to have diverged approximately 4.2-1.8 Ma ago: the split between the clades representing the eastern subspecies T. g. ibera and T. g. terrestris is younger than the split between Western Mediterranean tortoises and T.g. armeniaca. The Western Mediterranean lineages A-D were dated to have diverged at least 1.4-1.1 Ma ago: B-1 and B-2 split approximately 0.7 Ma ago. Our result, suggest that Italian and Spanish tortoises were either introduced or originated from trans-oceanic dispersal in historic or prehistoric times. Spur-thighed tortoises invaded North Africa probably across Near Eastern landbridges that emerged in the Late Tertiary. Their diversification in North Africa seems to be correlated with habitat aridization cycles during the Pleistocene. The ranges of the Western Mediterranean lineages largely correspond to the distribution of morphologically defined subspecies in North Africa, with exception of T. g. graeca and T. g. whitei, and T. q. lamberti and T. g. marokkensis, which are not differentiated. We propose to lump the first two subspecies Under the name of T. g. graeca and the latter under the name of T. g. marokkensis. The complex differentiation of spur-thighed tortoises in North Africa implies that the model of a bipartite east-west differentiation. as proposed for other Maghrebian amphibians and reptiles, may be too simplistic, reflecting incomplete locality sampling rather than actual phylogeographic differentiation.

AB  - This study identifies the endoparasites in Red-footed tortoises (Chelonoidis carbonaria) during March 2018 to March 2019 from Grenada, West Indies. Fecal samples from a total of 103 tortoises were collected and examined by simple fecal floatation techniques for parasitic eggs and oocysts. Adult parasites found in the feces were examined under the microscope for identification based on their morphology. Fecal samples for this research were collected from four parishes; St. Andrew, St George. St. John and St. Patrick. The overall prevalence of intestinal parasites among tortoises was 14.6%.
   The internal parasites consisted of nematodes belonging to three genera: Atractis, Labiduris and Proarractis. The most prevalent nematodes were Atractis spp. (86.7%), which included two species: A. thapari (7.7%) and A. marquezi (15.4%) followed by Labiduris gulosa (20%) and Proatractis parvicapiticaronata (13.3%). All nematodes of three genera found in red-footed tortoises in Grenada are reported for the first time. They are not zoonotic but are serious pathogens for tortoises.

AB  - Cryptosporidiosis is a disease caused by apicomplexan parasites of the genus Cryptosporidium, which affect the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals worldwide. In the present study, Cryptosporidium isolates from captive European tortoises (Testudo graeca, Testudo hermanni and Testudo marginata) in Italy were genetically characterised using gene/s encoding Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) and/or the hypervariable segment internal to the SSU rDNA. Six isolates from T. graeca, T. hermanni and T. marginata revealed 100% sequence identity with the zoonotic Cryptosporidium pestis (Cryptosporidium parvum 'bovine genotype'), while a sequence from one T. marginata was a unique uncharacterised genotype (Cryptosporidium sp. ex T. marginata). The new genotype is phylogenetically characterised as belonging to the intestinal cryptosporidial lineage. The present study indicates that tortoises may disseminate Cryptosporidium oocysts in the captive environment. The identification of the zoonotic genotype in the faeces of captive European tortoises indicates a potential risk for humans within the household. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Studies that aim to discover amphibian and reptilian species were conducted in the Istanbul islands which consists of Buyukada, Heybeliada, Burgazada and Kinaliada, during the years 2016-2019. The latest research of the islands was done 39 years ago and no studies were conducted since then. This study investigated the differences in species of amphibians and reptiles over these years. Bufotes variabilis (Pallas, 1769) from Buyukada, Hemidactylus turcicus (Linnaeus, 1758) from Heybeliada and Testudo graeca Linnaeus, 1758 from Kinaliada were given as new records from these localities. Principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to analysis the correlation of the amphibian and reptile diversity between Istanbul islands, Marmara islands and mainland. PC1 (eigenvalue of 1.91082) was accounted for 45.86 % of the variation. Results of PCA, Podarcis sloth's (Rafinesque & Schmaltz, 1810) was observed to display an extant and dominant population in all of the islands. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis was performed to assess the similarity in species among the islands. According to HCA, three cluster groups were formed. Islands of Istanbul have separate groups from other islands and mainland.

AB  - Using a broad-range nested PCR assay targeting the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase (pol) gene, we detected adenoviruses in 17 (20.48%) out of 83 fecal samples from small Indian mongooses (Urva auropunctata) on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. All 17 PCR amplicons were sequenced for the partial pol gene (~300 bp, hereafter referred to as Mon sequences). Fourteen of the 17 Mon sequences shared maximum homology (98.3-99.6% and 97-98.9% nucleotide (nt) and deduced amino acid (aa) sequence identities, respectively) with that of bovine adenovirus-6 (species Bovine atadenovirus E). Mongoose-associated adenovirus Mon-39 was most closely related (absolute nt and deduced aa identities) to an atadenovirus from a tropical screech owl. Mon-66 shared maximum nt and deduced aa identities of 69% and 71.4% with those of atadenoviruses from a spur-thighed tortoise and a brown anole lizard, respectively. Phylogenetically, Mon-39 and Mon-66 clustered within clades that were predominated by atadenoviruses from reptiles, indicating a reptilian origin of these viruses. Only a single mongoose-associated adenovirus, Mon-34, was related to the genus Mastadenovirus. However, phylogenetically, Mon-34 formed an isolated branch, distinct from other mastadenoviruses. Since the fecal samples were collected from apparently healthy mongooses, we could not determine whether the mongoose-associated adenoviruses infected the host. On the other hand, the phylogenetic clustering patterns of the mongoose-associated atadenoviruses pointed more towards a dietary origin of these viruses. Although the present study was based on partial pol sequences (~90 aa), sequence identities and phylogenetic analysis suggested that Mon-34, Mon-39, and Mon-66 might represent novel adenoviruses. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the detection and molecular characterization of adenoviruses from the mongoose.

AB  - The climate has undergone significant changes since the end of the Last Glacial Maximum and in the course of the Holocene, parallel to important cultural transformations and migrations in the human communities. The faunal record has also suffered the effects of climate change. Amphibians and reptiles in particular have been shown to be highly sensitive because they are very susceptible to temperature alterations due to their ectothermy. This research presents the first approach to the Iberian paleobiogeography of the different species of amphibians and reptiles from the Late Pleistocene (MIS3) to present times, based on a comparative synthesis of the latest research published in recent years and the fossil record of the 58 archaeo-paleontological sites with significant assemblages. The paleoherpetofaunal associations make it possible to establish two major biotic regions during the Late Pleistocene. The first biotic region was located in the center and south of the Iberian Peninsula, with thermophilic species as the most representative taxa. The second biotic region was formed by the Atlantic-Cantabrian facade and the northeast Iberian area, dominated by hygrophilous and Euro-Siberian species, with an absence of Mediterranean species. After the Last Glacial Maximum there was an unprecedented concurrence in the northern Iberian Peninsula of autochthonous taxa from that area with thermophilic species. In the early Holocene, new species with no previous record in the Iberian Peninsula entered northern Iberia from eastern Mediterranean refugia. Finally, the introduction of North African species was the last significant biogeographical change during the Middle-Late Holocene. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this review, we identified the diversity of the freshwater and terrestrial herpetofauna of Jordan that consists of a total of 103 species of extant reptiles (100 species and subspecies) and amphibians (3 species). Two amphibian species became extinct within the past thirty years (Triturus vittatus and Pelobates syriacus). Four categories of threats affecting amphibians and reptiles were identified (Habitat loss and degradation, water issues, human disturbance and related activities, and legislations and public awareness) along with supportive examples for each category of threats. Key species that requires urgent protection includes Hemidactylus mindiae, Acanthodactylus ahmaddisii, Chalcides guentheri, Phoenicolacerta kulzeri khazaliensis, Lacerta media, Platyceps elegantissimus, Platyceps sinai, Telescopus hoogstraali, and Macrovipera lebetina due to their limited distribution, and Uromastyx aegyptia, Chakides sepsoides, Scincus scincus meccensis, Trapelus persicus fieldii, and Testudo graeca due to habitat loss. The status of herpetofauna in Jordan is still far from being completely understood. Nevertheless, the lack of conservation measures and low public concern makes amphibians and reptiles extremely vulnerable in the near future.

AB  - The,authors diagnosed necrotic caeco-colitis and hepatitis caused by Entamoeba in a young green iguana (iguana iguana). The iguana was kept in a common terrarium with a Greek tortoise. Iguana was probably infected by taking cysts excreted through tortoise's faeces. Disease and death were preceded by significant decrease in temperature in the terrarium, which caused anorexia in the iguana. Instead of source of carbohydrate of plant origin, for finishing its cycle of development, for the cyst formation, the parasite started to dissolve mucous and epithelial layer of intestinal wall.

AB  - We studied the phylogeography of the Sahara frog in North Africa. We widely sampled frogs from Morocco to Tunisia (195 individuals) and sequenced two mitochondrial (16S and CO1) and one nuclear (Rag1) genes. Our results confirm that Moroccan populations of Pelophylax saharicus are genetically distinct from Algerian ones. Specimens from Alger and Djelfa (central Algeria) are genetically closer to Moroccan specimens than to east Algerian ones, and the split between these two lineages may have occurred approximately 2.6Mya. A similar pattern of differentiation was observed in several other species and was hypothesized to be linked to the formation of the fossil island called the Edough Peninsula' in eastern Algeria around 4.2Ma and then to have been reinforced by Pleistocene climatic changes. At the Moroccan scale, we found a low level of genetic diversity and no clear phylogeographic pattern within P.saharicus. However, our SAShA analyses revealed a mixture of random and underdistributed haplotypes, which may indicate a complex population genetic or biogeographic history.

AB  - Detection of Salmonella in pet turtles has been the focus of extensive research, but its incidence in free living turtles is not well known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of Salmonella in terrestrial and aquatic species of chelonians inhabiting a National Park in southwestem Spain. Individuals of the terrestrial tortoise Testudo graeca (n = 16) and the aquatic turtles Emys orbicularis (n = 26) and Mauremys leprosa (n = 50) were investigated. Maximum incidence of Salmonella was recorded in the terrestrial species (100%). In contrast, the incidence of infected animals was low in the aquatic species, 12% in M. leprosa and 15.4% in E. orbicularis. Five serotypes of Salmonella belonging to subspecies enterica (I) and salamae (II) were identified. All serotypes were found in the terrestrial species, and three in the aquatic ones, suggesting that wild terrestrial chelonians are important reservoirs of Salmonella in our study area. Cloacal transmission during mating is the most probable mode of transmission among individuals. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Studies that aim to discover amphibian and reptilian species were conducted in the Istanbul islands which consists of Btiviikada, Heybeliada, Burgazada and Kinaltada, during the years 2016-2019. The latest research of the islands was done 39 years ago and no studies were conducted since then. This study investigated the differences in species of amphibians and reptiles over these years. Bufotes variabilis (Pallas, 1769) from Bilytikada, Hemidactylus turcicus (Linnaeus, 1758) from Heybeliada and Testudo graeca Linnaeus, 1758 from Kinaltada were given as new records from these localities. Principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to analysis the correlation of the amphibian and reptile diversity between Istanbul islands, Marmara islands and mainland. PCI (eigenvalue of 1.91082) was accounted for 45.86 % of the variation. Results of PCA, Podarcis siculus (Rafinesque & Schmaltz, 1810) was observed to display an extant and dominant population in all of the islands. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis was performed to assess the similarity in species among the islands. According to HCA, three cluster groups were formed. Islands of Istanbul have separate groups from other islands and mainland.

AB  - A radiodense area of the left coeloma was found in a greek turtoise (testudo hermanni), admitted to clinical examination because of a paresis of the left forelimb and an increasing dyspnoea. Histopathologically, the space-requiring process proved to be a tubuloalveolar adenocarcinoma, having its origin in the bronchial epithelium. Inside the lung tissue, the growth of the tumour occured expansive and canalicular. On the other hand it infiltrated the peritracheal tissue.
   The cranial margin of the neoplasm reached the acromion scapulae of the left forelimb, leading to the observed paresis.

AB  - Testudo graeca, Testudo hermanni and Testudo marginata are endangered species listed in the IUCN Red List and Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Correct identification of species and distinct population units can support sound conservation projects and forensic applications. However, the collection of biological samples is not always easy or harmless. Blood sampling is usually invasive and risky. Salivary swab sampling is commonly used in other reptiles but can be unsafe for tortoises by the reason of their head retraction escape response. Cloacal swab sampling should be easier and less risky. In this study, we genotyped 37 tortoises at eight microsatellite loci and compared the reliability of individual genotypes obtained from blood, cloacal and buccal swabs. Results showed that performances of cloacal samples are comparable with those of buccal and blood samples, and proved that cloacal sampling is an alternative and reliable source of DNA for tortoise genotyping.

AB  - Herpesviruses are significant pathogens of tortoises, causing upper respiratory tract disease and necrotizing stomatitis, with infections often associated with high mortality rates. Herpesvirus infection in a captive California desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) was detected by light microscopic observation of intranuclear inclusion bodies in various tissues followed by transmission electron microscopic observation of herpesvirus-like particles, and amplification of herpesvirus nucleic acid sequences using polymerase chain reaction. Using an indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, anti-tortoise herpesvirus antibodies were detected one month after initial onset of clinical signs. This novel herpesvirus is distinct from the previously described tortoise herpesvirus (tortoise herpesvirus-1, THV-1) sharing 83% sequence identity of 60 amino acids of a portion of the DNA polymerase gene and 79% sequence identity across 120 amino acids of a portion of the ribonucleotide reductase gene. Similar to THV-1, this novel herpesvirus, tortoise herpes-virus-2 (THV-2), also clusters with the alphaherpesviruses. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence and diversity of Campylobacter species in chelonians. From July 2016 to September 2017, a total of 452 individuals from a large variety of tortoises (n = 366) and turtles/terrapins (n = 86) kept in private collections and breeding centres, wildlife rescue centres, zoos, pet shops, and veterinary clinics from Northern Italy was sampled and subjected to microbiological examination. Campylobacter genus and species confirmation was performed by single and multiplex PCRs. Out of 452 samples, five (1.1%) tested positive: three for C. iguaniorum (two Testudo graeca and one Testudo hermanni), one for C. fetus subsp. testudinum (Stigmochelys pardalis) and one for C. geochelonis (Testudo hermanni). This study suggests that Campylobacter spp. are not common in chelonians, but a variety of species can be detected in these hosts, including those potentially pathogenic for humans. Further studies are needed to understand the epidemiology and the pathogenic potential for both animals and humans of reptile-associated Campylobacter spp.

AB  - An experimental transmission study aimed at fulfilling Koch's postulates for a herpesvirus-associated stomatitis-rhinitis in Mediterranean tortoises is presented. Clinical, pathologic, serologic, and molecular studies were performed linking tortoise herpesvirus with the pathogenesis of stomatitis-rhinitis. Four adult Greek tortoises received either intranasally or intramuscularly two tortoise herpesvirus isolates by primary experimental infection and secondary challenge 11 months later. After the primary experimental infection and the secondary challenge, clinical signs of illness developed, which included conjunctivitis, diphtheritic oral plaques, and oral discharge. At 4 weeks after the secondary challenge, all tortoises were humanely euthanatized and evaluated. Although neutralizing antibodies developed after the primary experimental infection, they apparently did not prevent the later development of recurrent clinical signs. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription-PCR analyses allowed sensitive characterization of the systemic distribution of the herpesvirus DNA sequences and their presence in the cranial nerves and brains of the infected tortoises. Despite the failure to recover the herpesviruses used in the transmission study, the findings support the premise that tortoise herpesvirus is a primary pathogen of Greek tortoises.

AB  - Borrelia turcica comprises the third major group of arthropod-transmitted borreliae and is phylogenetically divergent from other Borrelia groups. The novel group of Borrelia was initially isolated from Hyalomma aegyptium ticks in Turkey and it was recently found in blood and multiple organs of tortoises exported from Jordan to Japan. However, the ecology of these spirochetes and their development in ticks or the vertebrate hosts were not investigated in detail; our aims were to isolate the pathogen and to evaluate the possibility of transstadial transmission of Borrelia turcica by H. aegyptium ticks. Ticks were collected from Testudo graeca tortoises during the summer of 2013 from southeastern Romania. Engorged nymphs were successfully molted to the adult stage. Alive B. turcica was isolated from molted ticks by using Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly (BSK) II medium. Four pure cultures of spirochetes were obtained and analyzed by PCR and sequencing. Sequence analysis of glpQ, gyrB and flaB revealed 98%-100% similarities with B. turcica. H. aegyptium ticks collected from T. graeca tortoises were able to pass the infection with B. turcica via transstadial route, suggesting its vectorial capacity.

AB  - During the months of April to August in 1999 and 2002, oral swabs were collected from 146 tortoises (Testudo sp.) in private collections in the United Kingdom and tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of Mycoplasma agassizii and Chelonian herpesvirus (ChHV). The presence of M. agassizii was confirmed by restriction digestion of the PCR product. A 307-bp fragment of the ChHV UL5 homologue gene was sequenced and found to show most similarity to equine herpesvirus type 1. A prevalence of 15.8 and 8.2% was found for M. agassizii and ChHV, respectively. Comparison of the carriage of both M. agassizii and ChHV in different species of tortoises correlated the presence of M. agassizii with Testudo horsfieldii and ChHV with Testudo marginata and Testudo graeca iberia. An association of ChHV with stomatitis was also found. Mixed infections with both agents were detected. The findings further demonstrate this pathogen-tortoise association and the cross transmission of these infections if different tortoise species are housed together.

AB  - Light microscopy as well as scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed the lungs of loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta), hatchlings to be multichambered with several separate open chambers communicating with a cartilage-reinforced central intrapulmonary bronchus. This central bronchus is structurally analogous to an oversized mammalian respiratory bronchiole. The subsequent branching airways, chambers and niches, are in many ways structurally and functionally similar to mammalian alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs, respectively. The airways are lined by a pseudostratified, columnar epithelium comprised of ciliated, nonciliated secretory, and basal cells. Histochemically, the epithelium is found to contain cells secreting both sialomucins and sulfomucins, as well as a neutral serous secretion. Small granule cells, a type of neuroendocrine cell similar to those seen in mammals, are scattered among the other airway cells. The gas-exchange areas, termed ediculae, are lined by the respiratory type I and type II pneumocytes, as in mammals. Abundant smooth muscle is seen in the trabeculae and interedicular septa of the lung tissue. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The welfare of wild-caught animals in markets has generally been overlooked by both wildlife trade and welfare studies, despite the potential negative impacts on the animals. Morocco is a member of the World Organisation for Animal Health and has proposed draft legislation prohibiting mistreatment or abuse of animals in captivity. There is still, however, a bustling wild animal trade, and vendor compliance with industry-standard best practices is lacking. This study provides insight into the conditions of 2113 wild-caught animals in markets in six of the largest cities in Morocco by scoring their welfare based on four of the Farm Animal Welfare Committee Five Freedoms: freedom from hunger and thirst, freedom from discomfort, freedom to express normal behavior, and freedom from distress. Over 88% of animals were housed in situations that broke all four of the freedoms measured, and only 9 animals were in situations that broke none. Access to water, sun/heat exposure, and ability to hide from stressors were particularly poor. We urge the Moroccan government to fulfill its commitment to establish welfare laws and devote resources to their application.

AB  - We present briefly the distribution of amphibians and reptiles in the Special Protected Area " Besaparski ridove" in southwestern Bulgaria, based on a 2x2 km UTM grid. Between 1998 and 2008, we identified 24 species, and failed to verify the literature data only for a fossorial boa, Eryx jaculus. We documented five new amphibian species for the region (Salamandra salamandra, Triturus karelinii, Bombina variegata, Bufo bufo, Rana dalmatina, and R. graeca) and four species of reptiles (Testudo graeca, T. hermanni, Ablepharus kitaibelii, and Zamenis longissimus). The least common amphibians in the protected area were S. salamandra, R. graeca, and T. karelinii (number of squares in which these species are present from the total, A = 1.85%) and the most common were Pelophylax ridibundus (A = 35.19%), B. bufo (A = 20.37%), and Epidalea viridis (A = 18.52%). The least common reptiles were T. graeca, T. hermanni, Z. longissimus, Platyceps najadum (A = 1.85%) and A. kitaibelii and E. jaculus (A = 3.7%). The most common reptiles were Podarcis tauricus (A = 44.44%), Lacerta trilineata (A = 42.59%), and L. viridis (A = 29.63%).

AB  - The lungs of the red-eared turtle, Pseudemys scripta elegans, have been investigated by light-microscopical immunocytochemistry for serotonin (5-HT) and the neuropeptides calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), enkephalin (ENK), bombesin, somatostatin, calcitonin and cholecystokinin.  CGRP- or 5-HT-like immunoreactivity (LI) was demonstrated in neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs) and solitary neuroepithelial endocrine cells lying between the ciliated epithelial cells of the intrapulmonary bronchi, and of the primary, secondary and tertiary trabeculae.  Furthermore, ENK-LI NEBs were found between the trabecular ciliated epithelial cells.  No reaction was observed with antisera against bombesin, somatostatin, calcitonin, and cholecystokinin.  Using consecutive sections, CGRP-LI appears to be colocalized with 5-HT-LI in NEB cells.  In addition, it was demonstrated that all the ENK-LI NEBs also contain CGRP-LI, whereas only a part of the CGRP-LI NEBs reveal ENK-LI.  To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of CGRP- and/or ENK-LI in pulmonary NEBs of a lower vertebrate.

AB  - Herpesvirus infections are significant in the care of turtles and tortoises. Clinical signs range from unspecific symptoms, due to the variety of organ manifestations, to the "classical" picture of rhinitis-stomatitis. The presented case study showed the typical disease only with respect to clinical symptoms following hibernation, but lacks stomatitis, erosions or plaques in the oral mucosa. On the other hand, skin lesions on the extremeties, causative with herpesvirus infection, could be diagnosed. In this case study, various symptoms, sampling procedures and diagnostics using two different PCR methods are presented. Following hibernation, samples from a Russian tortoise (Agrionemys horsfieldii) were taken ante mortem and postmortem and screened with respect to virology, pathology, bacteriology and parasitology. DNA-fragments specific for tortoise herpesvirus were detected in various organs and body liquids. Furthermore basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies were found. The bacteriological examination showed a high level of Pasteurella testunis in the lungs. By parasitological examination nematodes (Oxyridae) were diagnosed. A potential prophylaxis for tortoise herpesvirus is discussed.

AB  - Habitat alteration and loss are the main threats to the conservation of tortoises (Testudo spp.), but also pet trade plays an important role in their reduction. In the European Union, the capture from nature is banned for several species, and only bred animals can be possessed and sold after their legal birth in captivity has been confirmed. Parentage analysis through molecular markers has a great applicability in wildlife conservation since allows verifying whether newborns are offspring of known captive-bred individuals and thus not illegally taken from the wild. In this paper, we developed a panel of 16 de novo sequenced microsatellites (STRs) for conservation genetics of T. graeca and we tested its effectiveness also for parentage analysis in two other species of endangered tortoises, T. hermanni and T. marginata. The reported data demonstrated the suitability and reliability of the protocol in T. graeca and T. hermanni, but not in T. marginata. For this last species, an integration with previously isolated or de novo developed markers is needed for applications in conservation genetics.

AB  - Laying eggs on a wet substrate minimizes water stress for flexible-shelled reptile eggs because they absorb water through the permeable shell. This water gain contributes to reduced water-loss in aggregated eggs. This water-conserving feature is demonstrated in eggs of Lampropeltis mexicana in a water-balance experiment investigating both naturally laid clutches and eggs in arranged clusters. Water-loss rates of eggs decrease as more eggs are added to the aggregation, with a threshold at approximately 15 eggs. There is no further reduction in water-loss rate for eggs in an aggregation of 20, which exceeds the typical maximum for natural clutch size in this species. Blowing dry air over the egg clutch causes this water-conserving feature to disappear, but it re-appears when the air is still (air current turned off). This is the first time that an increase in water-vapor pressure in an aggregation of eggs has been demonstrated experimentally; the results suggest that laying aggregations of eggs may benefit development through moisture conservation.

AB  - Use of molecular markers for identification of protected species offers a greater promise in the field of conservation biology. The information on genetic diversity of wildlife is necessary to ascertain the genetically deteriorated populations so that better management plans can be established for their conservation. Accurate classification of these threatened species allows understanding of the species biology and identification of distinct populations that should be managed with utmost care. Molecular markers are versatile tools for identification of populations with genetic crisis by comparing genetic diversities that in turn helps to resolve taxonomic uncertainties and to establish management units within species. The genetic marker analysis also provides sensitive and useful tools for prevention of illegal hunting and poaching and for more effective implementation of the laws for protection of the endangered species. This review summarizes various tools of DNA markers technology for application in molecular diversity analysis with special emphasis on wildlife conservation. (C) 2011 King Saud University.

AB  - We used GIS and maximum entropy to predict the potential distribution of six snake species belong to three families in Kroumiria (Northwestern Tunisia): Natricidae (Natrix maura and Natrix astreptophora), Colubridae (Hemorrhois hippocrepis, Coronella girondica and Macroprotodon mauritanicus), and Lamprophiidae (Malpolon insignitus). The suitable habitat for each species was modelled using the maximum entropy algorithm, combining presence field data (collected during 16 years: 2000-2015) with a set of seven environmental variables (mean annual precipitation, elevation, slope gradient, aspect, distance to watercourses, land surface temperature and normalized Differential Vegetation Index. The relative importance of these environmental variables was evaluated by jackknife tests and the predictive power of our models was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic. The main explicative variables of the species distribution were distance from streams and elevation, with contributions ranging from 60 to 77 and from 10 to 25%, respectively. Our study provided the first habitat suitability models for snakes in Kroumiria and this information can be used by conservation biologists and land managers concerned with preserving snakes in Kroumiria.

AB  - Intranuclear coccidiosis of itestudines (known as TINC) is an emerging disease in chelonians. Although endogenous stages were repeatedly detected in various tissues, attempts to find the oocysts in faeces failed, leaving the question of the transmission and classification of the causative agent of TINC unresolved. We recorded small spherical oocysts (similar to 6-7 mu m in diameter) of an eimeriid coccidium in faeces of a leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis). Sporulated oocysts were used for the experimental oral inoculation of juvenile coccidia-free tortoises representing 5 species (S. pardalis, Testudo graeca, T. hermanni, T. horsfieldii, and Geochelone sulcata). The oocysts' association with TINC was confirmed based on clinical signs, histopathological findings of intranuclear endogenous stages of the coccidium in many organs (including intestine), and by the partial 18S rDNA sequence analysis of the DNA isolated from organs of the experimentally infected animals and from a single naturally infected as well as from all experimentally infected tortoises. Breeding colonies of chelonians should be screened for this pathogen in order to prevent its further spread and unwanted introduction into endangered free-ranging chelonian populations.

AB  - Picornaviruses (PVs) of different terrestrial tortoise species, previously designated as Virus X, have been frequently detected from various tissues by virus isolation in Terrapene heart cell culture as the preferred laboratory method for diagnosis. Here, we describe the development of 2 diagnostic reverse transcription (RT)-PCR-based assays for the identification and characterization of tortoise PVs belonging to the tentative genus Topivirus. To test the novel diagnostic systems, PVs were isolated from swab and tissue samples collected in Germany, Italy, and Hungary between 2000 and 2013. All 25 tested isolates gave positive results with both novel consensus primer sets. Sequencing of the amplified products confirmed that all studied viruses were members of the new proposed genus Topivirus. Phylogenetic analyses clearly distinguished 2 lineages within the genus. Based on sequence analysis, no association was observed between the geographic distribution and genetic relatedness. Furthermore, no strict host specificity was indicated. The PCR-based diagnosis may provide a time-saving and sensitive method to detect tortoise PVs, and evaluation of PV presence in these animals may help control virus spread.

AB  - Since the 1970s, several species of herpesviruses have been identified and associated with significant diseases in reptiles. Earlier discoveries placed these viruses into different taxonomic groups on the basis of morphological and biological characteristics, while advancements in molecular methods have led to more recent descriptions of novel reptilian herpesviruses, as well as providing insight into the phylogenetic relationship of these viruses. Herpesvirus infections in reptiles are often characterised by non-pathognomonic signs including stomatitis, encephalitis, conjunctivitis, hepatitis and proliferative lesions. With the exception of fibropapillomatosis in marine turtles, the absence of specific clinical signs has fostered misdiagnosis and underreporting of the actual disease burden in reptilian populations and hampered potential investigations that could lead to the effective control of these diseases. In addition, complex life histories, sampling bias and poor monitoring systems have limited the assessment of the impact of herpesvirus infections in wild populations and captive collections. Here we review the current published knowledge of the taxonomy, pathogenesis, pathology and epidemiology of reptilian herpesviruses.

AB  - There are numerous chelonian species that arise from a diverse array of habitats. Chelonians are long lived and slow to reach sexual maturity, making them extremely vulnerable to human impacts on their habitat and populations. Unusual anatomic and physiological features, such as the shell and being ectothermic, make chelonians medically challenging for the veterinarian. This article presents information on the medical evaluation and stabilization of critically ill and injured chelonian patients presented to the emergency clinician. History taking, performing a physical examination, recommended diagnostic testing, fluid and transfusion therapy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation principles, nutritional support, hospital environment, and therapeutic agents recommended for the emergency and critical care of chelonians are reviewed. Differential diagnoses are presented for a variety of conditions encountered by the emergency clinician for marine turtles, tortoises, freshwater aquatic turtles, and terrapins. There are significant differences in the disease problems encountered by captive and free-ranging specimens. This review will be useful for the veterinarian working in private practice, zoological or aquarium medicine, and wildlife rehabilitation. Copy right 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T2  - VETERINARY RECORD
LA  - English
KW  - POPULATION
AB  - Courtship behaviour of tortoises includes biting, ramming, chasing, same-sex sexual behaviour, and it commonly is excessive in European tortoise species kept as pets. As a result, males are kept individually. To assess the effect of orchiectomy on excessive courtship behaviour in European tortoises, 50 tortoises (Testudo graeca, T hermanni and T marginata) underwent endoscopically assisted orchiectomy from April through September 2013 to 2017. Statistical analyses were performed in relation to species, body mass, testicular size and season and owners were invited to fill out a follow-up questionnaire. Body mass of the tortoises ranged from 334 to 2645 g (mean 1056 g) and the age from 5 to estimated 60 years. Testicular length ranged from 1.4 to 7.0 cm (mean 2.7 cm) and testicular mass from 0.6 to 12.6 g (mean 3.9 g). A complete or partial reduction (allowing group-housing) of the excessive courtship behaviour was noted by 95 per cent of owners and 59 per cent of the owners reported a noticeable change of behaviour within a month of surgery. Given the seasonal variation in testicular size, the best period for castrations in male European tortoises is shortly after brumation (April, May), when testes are proportionally smaller.

AB  - Preservation of biological samples is a relevant issue for many scientific disciplines. Although traditional pre-servers, such as formaldehyde or ethanol, imply major disadvantages related to health risks, DNA degradation and distortion of structures, they are widely used. Hence, the search for viable alternatives preserving morphometry and genetics seems necessary. Here we assess the suitability of DESS solution to preserve adult nematodes and their eggs in faeces. Concretely, faecal samples of terrestrial tortoises with oxyurids were used to: (i) compare the 1-month storage efficacy of eggs from different conservation protocols (faeces without preserver at-20 degrees C, faeces with DESS solution at room temperature, faeces with DESS solution at-20 degrees C and faeces with ethanol 70% at room temperature); (ii) address morphological nematode identification after 2 years of storage with DESS. We also corroborated that nematode DNA remained viable after 2 years. Overall, our results showed that DESS solution at room temperature is an advisable alternative to conserve both parasite eggs and adult nematodes for morphological identification and genetic purposes. It also offers the advantages of being low-cost, safe and suitable for fieldwork conditions and shipments without refrigeration for nematode preservation.

AB  - The ocellated lizards in the Timon lepidus/tangitanus/pater complex include the largest lacertids living in continental Europe and North Africa. Long considered a single species (T pater), the division of the North African ocellated lizards into two species, T pater in Tunisia and Algeria, and T tangitanus in Morocco, is now accepted. In this study we investigated the patterns of genetic diversity in T tangitanus and T pater across North Africa. We analysed 12s rRNA and 16s rRNA mtDNA fragments of 26 new samples plus 19 sequences from previous studies, using parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian approaches. Our results confirm the two North African species as well-defined entities. Within T tangitanus from Morocco, three genetically divergent lineages with geographic congruence were uncovered; one in the north, another widely spread across Central Morocco and one in the High Atlas and farther south. A high level of divergence among the Moroccan lineages suggests the split occurred just after the divergence between T tangitanus and T paten Similar patterns have been found in other species, although more studies are needed to understand the biogeographical events shaping the complex diversity in this region.

AB  - In many reptile species, sexual differentiation of gonads is sensitive to temperature during a critical period of embryonic development (thermosensitive period, TSP). Experiments carried out with different models among which turtles, crocodilians and lizards have demonstrated the implication of estrogens and the key role played by aromatase (the enzyme complex that converts androgens to estrogens) in ovary differentiation during TSP and in maintenance of the ovarian structure after TSP. In some of these experiments, the occurrence of various degrees of gonadal intersexuality is related to weak differences in aromatase activity, suggesting subtle regulations of the aromatase gene at the transcription level. Temperature could intervene in these regulations. Present studies deal with cloning (complementary DNAs) and expression (messenger RNAs) of genes that have been shown, or are expected, to be involved in gonadal formation and/or differentiation in mammals. Preliminary results indicate that homologues of AMH, DAX1, SF1, SOX9 and WT1 genes with the same function(s) as in mammals exist in reptiles. How these genes could interact with aromatase is being examined.

AB  - Chelonians suffering from traumatic shell fractures sustained from animal bites, car accidents, or rare accidents pertaining to illegal captivity (e.g., lawn mowers and electric shutters) are often seen at the Israeli Wildlife Hospital (BATH) in Ramat Gan, Israel. As shell fracture repair can be time consuming and difficult, often involving an extended healing period of a few months to >1 year, a successful repair process requires a reliable procedure that provides structural integrity. Veterinarians at the IWH have found that the Top Closure System (TCS) is a durable yet simple and inexpensive external fixation device that can easily be secured to fractured chelonian shells with dental acrylic adhesive. The TCS may be used noninvasively to stabilize shell fractures, while still enabling the use of conventional local treatment. The TCS repair technique was administered in the BATH for treatment of 7 chelonians: 3 Spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) and 4 Caspian turtles (Mauremys caspica), which were later released into their native environments. The TCS, a novel effective device originally designed for human soft tissue stretching, has successfully been used to mend chelonian shell fractures, while eliminating internal tissue damage and reducing any risk of infection.

AB  - Serologic assays are emerging as powerful tools for both diagnosing and screening collections of reptiles for exposure to and infection with certain pathogens. For the most part, these tests were developed in research laboratories with a specific interest in diseases of captive and free-ranging reptiles. Relatively few are commercially available, with most offered through individual research laboratories or universities. Tests have been developed for exposure to paramyxovirus of snakes, mycoplasma of tortoises and crocodilians, herpesvirus infection of marine turtles and tortoises, cryptosporidium of snakes, and spirorchid trematodes of sea turtles. Of the various serologic tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is becoming the test with the most application. Although ELISA is relatively simple and has certain positive attributes such as high sensitivity and specificity, in the indirect format it does require specific anti-reptile immunoglobulins that recognize and bind to the antibody being assayed. In this report, we review reptile humoral immunity for the major orders of reptiles, assays available for determining exposure of reptiles to specific pathogens, and factors affecting the immune response of reptiles.

AB  - In this paper, we review data on the monotreme immune system focusing on the characterisation of lymphoid tissue and of antibody responses, as well the recent cloning of immunoglobulin genes. It is now known that monotremes utilise immunoglobulin isotypes that are structurally identical to those found in marsupials and eutherians, but which differ to those found in birds and reptiles. Monotremes utilise IgM, IgG, IgA and IgE. They do not use IgY. Their IgG and IgA constant regions contain three domains plus a hinge region. Preliminary analysis of monotreme heavy chain variable region diversity suggests that the platypus primarily uses a single VH clan, while the short-beaked echidna utilises at least 4 distinct VH families which segregate into all three mammalian VH clans. Phylogenetic analysis of the immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region gene sequences provides strong support for the Theria hypothesis. The constant region of IgM has proven to be a useful marker for estimating the time of divergence of mammalian lineages. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Neuroendocrine (NE) cells in the gills of six fish species were identified by serotonin and peptide immunohistochemistry. They occur either as single cells or as cell clusters within the filamental epithelium. Two populations of NE cells were identified that exhibit an immunoreactivity either for serotonin alone or for met-enkephalin and leu-enkephalin co-distributed in the same cells. We demonstrate for the first time the occurrence of open-type endocrine cells in the fish gill epithelium and confirm the presence of only serotonin-immunopositive cells of the closed type. The NE cells of the species studied do not react positively to other neuroendocrine markers occurring in the mammalian lung. Great differences probably exist in the expression of these epitopes on antigenic structures among various animal species.
   Although the physiological role of neuropeptides and serotonin in the fish gill NE cells is unknown, thc presence of these molecular markers is of interest not only from an evolutionary aspect, but also in terms of a potential animal model to study the supposed functions of the airway neuroendocrine system in the vertebrates.

AB  - Knowledge of blood parasites in Brazilian chclonians is limited, since they have been recorded in only six species. Mesoclemmys vanderhaegei (Bour) is a freshwater turtle with a wide geographic distribution in Brazil, but there is little information about its natural history. This paper reports on a study of the prevalence and infection intensity of a haemogregarine in two subpopulations of M. vanderhaegei. The study was conducted in two areas of Corrado in the Upper Paraguay River basin in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, between November 2010 and August 2013. Ninety-five (53%) of the 179 turtles captured were positive for hacmogregarine parasites. The parasitic forms observed were two morphotypes of intracrythrocyfic gametocytes. The prevalence differed between size classes, increasing significantly according to the animals' body size. There was no significant difference between prevalence and sex, or between sampling periods. The mean parasite intensity was 9 parasites/2,000 erythrocytes (0.45%) and the parasite population presented an aggregated distribution, with an aggregation index of 19 and discrepancy of 0.772. This is the first record of a hemoparasite in the freshwater turtle M. vanderhaegei.

AB  - Massimo Delfino, Francesco Chesi, and Uwe Fritz (2009) Shell morphology of the Egyptian tortoise, Testudo kleinmanni Lortet, 1883, the osteologically least-known Testudo species. Zoological Studies 48(6): 850-860. The present paper provides the first detailed description of the shell osteology of Testudo kleinmanni, a small tortoise species that currently occurs only in a narrow, discontinuous strip along the southeastern Mediterranean coast, extending from Libya to Israel. Its bony shell differs from the partially codistributed species T graeca in characters present on the nuchal, suprapygal, pygal, epiplastron, entoplastron, hyoplastron, and xiphiplastron. The other shell elements are very similar in both species. For such elements, only the smaller adult size of T kleinmanni can be used for tentative species identification. Generally, shell osteology does not reflect the currently accepted sister-group relationship of T kleinmanni and T marginata (the only possible shared character may be the shape of the pectoro-abdominal sulcus). Until now, the species has never been identified from palaeontological assemblages and only very rarely in archaeological settings. The extreme rarity of fossil and subfossil records could be caused, at least in part, by the fact that diagnostic osteological characters were previously unknown. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/48.6/850.pdf

AB  - Growth patterns of captive-bred Seychelles-Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys/Dipsochelys) were studied. This enabled the comparison of the development of 3 distinct morphotypes variously ascribed by different authors to 3 distinct species or a single, variable species (A./D. dussumieri/gigantea, arnoldi, and hololissa). Geometric morphometric analyses identified differences in growth pattern between the 3 morphotypes of 234 juvenile tortoises reared under identical conditions. In plastral characters, all 3 morphotypes could be distinguished from hatching. Initially, hatchlings were very similar in dorsal view but by 30-cm straight carapace length were distinguishable by relative warp analysis. The arnoldi morphotype is the most distinctive, with constriction in the center of the carapace resulting in the beginning of development of saddle-backed morphology from 30 cm. All 3 morphotypes show 2 distinct growth patterns, one from hatching to 20-30 cm and a different pattern above 30 cm. As these morphotypes were reared under identical, largely constant conditions, this change in growth patterns appears to be a result of ontogeny rather than environment. Differences in development of the morphotypes cannot be explained by environmental factors alone and may be the result of differences in gene expression or of small differences in genes associated with skeletal development.

AB  - International trade of animals may represent a gateway for the spreading of zoonotic pathogens and their vectors. Amongst animals, reptiles are commonly illegally imported worldwide, being Italy in the fifth position of importation of these animals. Thus, the current study analysed the pathogens associated with Hyalomma aegyptium ticks, which were collected from illegally imported tortoises from North Africa to Italy. All tick DNA samples were tested by conventional PCR for the presence of Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp., Borrelia spp., Coxiella burnetti, Ehrlichia spp., Hepatozoon spp., Rickettsia spp. and microfilariae of filarioids. Out of 22% (n=161) of ticks screened, 78.9% (n=127) were males and 21.1% (n=34) females. Among them, three male specimens collected from two different turtles (1.9%; 95% CI; 0.5-5.5) scored positive for Anaplasma spp./Ehrlichia spp., whereas all females were negative. BLAST analysis of the sequences obtained from positive samples revealed 99-99.3% nucleotide identity with the sequence of Ehrlichia ewingii available in GenBank. The finding of E. ewingii in ticks from imported reptiles warrants the need for imposing strict rules in the international trade of reptiles to effectively reduce the introduction of exotic pathogens and their vectors in new geographic areas.

AB  - Health and disease are becoming extremely relevant issues for the conservation biology of members of all major groups of vertebrates. The importance of disease in captive propaption, relocation, repatriation, and translocation (RRT) programs is just being appreciated. All of us experience multiple diseases in our lifetimes. Reptiles are not different. They are susceptible to the range of infectious agents known to occur in other vertebrates. The causes of disease in captive reptiles are better understood than those in their wild counterparts. However, several important diseases have recently been documented in wild chelonians. One of these, upper respiratory tract disease in the desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) is thought to have been introduced into populations of tortoises in the Mojave Desert in the southwestern USA by release of ill captive desert tortoises. A similar situation appears to exist for certain populations of the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) in Florida, USA. Although conservation strategies such as RRT programs have been implemented for a number of threatened/endangered reptiles, results indicate that the success rate is rather low. Because of this low success rate and the recent awareness of the possible introduction of exotic pathogens acquired in captivity, release programs should be scrutinized more closely.

AB  - Testudo lunellensis Almera and Bofill, 1903 from the Middle Pleistocene of Cova de Gracia (Park Guell, Barcelona, Spain) is a valid species belonging to the clade of the extant Testudo hermanni - a diagnostic feature being the narrowed vertebral scutes. Thanks to still unpublished material, T. lunellensis is diagnosed for the first time and its shell morphology described in detail. This species is uniquely characterized, among others, by tall peripheral bones and by a peculiar shape of the anterior lobe of the plastron, somewhat recalling the species referred to Testudo s.s. (the clade containing the extant species Testudo graeca, Testudo kleinmanni and Testudo marginata). Given that the purported valid species from Lunel-Viel (Middle Pleistocene, France) is still unnamed and undescribed, T. lunellensis from Cova de Gracia is currently the stratigraphically youngest extinct Testudo species. The co-occurrence in T. lunellensis of characters typical of both T. hermanni and Testudo s.s. further testifies the phenotypic plasticity of tortoises and the mosaic distribution of morphological characters, which hinders a clear-cut assessment of the relationships of extant tortoises when based exclusively on morphology. Further analyses of the phylogeny of Testudo should consider fossil and extant taxa together, as well as both morphological and genetic characters.

AB  - Four species of Protozoa, 17 species of helminths and 6 species of ticks parasitize on the Central Asian tortoise, Agrionemys horsfieldii Gray 1844. Parasitic Protozoa are mainly referred to Sporozoa. Helminths are represented by Nematoda and belong to the orders Oxyurida, Ascaridida, and Spirurida. Most of the nematode species belong to Oxyuridea and Pharyngodonidae. The greatest species diversity of Pharyngodonidae falls on 2 specific Testudinidae genus: Tachygonetria and Mehdiella. Hyalomma aegyptium predominates among ixodid ticks. All ontogenic phases parasitize on Central Asian tortoise, mainly at the stage of imago. The extensiveness of H. aegyptium infection in turtles varies greatly (from 0 to 79%). Four other Ixodidae species parasitize on turtle at the phase of larvae and nymphs. Haemaphysalis sulcata is the first among them by the frequency of occurrence. Among argasids, only Ornithodoros tartakovskyi parasitizes on A. horsfieldii. The pattern of spreading of all the ticks in the tortoise populations is local. Tortoises are most frequently infected with ticks at the foothills. Several tick species can parasitize simultaneously on the same individual. The activity of parasites synchronously coincides with the seasonal activity of A. horsfieldi. The maximum number of parasites falls on late spring and early summer. After hibernation, the infestation of tortoises with parasites is minimal

AB  - The experimental study investigated the ability of tortoise tick Hyalomma aegyptium to play a role in forming and maintaining natural foci of Q fever. We tested the competence of H. aegyptium larvae to acquire Coxiella burnetii infection from mammals, serve as a C. burnetii vector between mammalian hosts, and be a long-term carrier of C. burnetii, including interstadial transmission. H. aegyptium larvae were allowed to feed on guinea pigs experimentally infected with C. burnetii. Engorged larvae molted to nymphs, some of which were preserved in 96% ethanol and later examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using C. burnetii-specific primers (CBCOS, CBCOE). Prevalence of C. burnetii among these nymphs was 5.6% (n = 235). Remaining nymphs then fed on other, C. burnetii-negative guinea pigs; and according to results of both, micro-agglutination reaction, and ELISA, they successfully transmitted C. burnetii to those new hosts. Detached engorged nymphs molted to adults, which were kept alive long term and then placed in 96% ethanol 383 days post-infection. Thereafter, they were examined by PCR in the same manner as were the nymphs. Prevalence of C. burnetii among adult H. aegyptium was 28.9% (n = 90).

AB  - Seventeen desert tortoises, Xerobates agassizii, with upper respiratory tract disease were examined; thirteen were euthanatized for necropsy.  Four normal control desert tortoises from a clinically healthy population were similarly evaluated.  Hemoglobin and phosphorus values were significantly (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) lower and serum sodium, urea, SGOT, and cholesterol values were significantly higher in ill tortoises compared to controls.  No significant differences in concentrations of serum or liver vitamins A and E were found between the two groups.  While no significant differences were found for concentrations of lead, copper, cadmium, and selenium, the livers of ill tortoises had higher concentrations of mercury and iron.  Lesions were found consistently in the upper respiratory tract (URT) of ill tortoises.  In all ill tortoises dense infiltrates of lymphocytes and histiocytes obscured the mucosal epithelium and underlying glands.  The mucosal epithelium was variably dysplastic, hyperplastic, and occasionally ulcerated.  Electron microscopic studies revealed small (350 to 900 nm), pleomorphic organisms resembling Mycoplasma sp., in close association with the surface epithelium of the URT of ill tortoises.  Pasteurella testudinis was cultured from the nasal cavity of all ill tortoises and one of four control tortoises.  A Mycoplasma sp. was cultured from the nasal passageways of four ill tortoises and was ultrastructurally similar to the pleomorphic organism present on the mucosa in tissue section.

AB  - Despite gastrointestinal parasites being commonly diagnosed in captive tortoises throughout the UK, there is a lack of data regarding the prevalence. The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in tortoises in the UK, and to investigate the factors affecting the prevalence of these parasites. Owners were invited to submit a faecal sample from their tortoise in conjunction with a completed questionnaire covering details of signalment and husbandry. Data from the questionnaires were analysed at the end of the study. Faecal analysis was performed on samples from Testudo hermanni, Testudo graeca and Testudo horsfieldii. This involved examination of direct wet preparations, a modified McMaster technique, passive NaCl flotation and Cryptosporidium staining. Of the 142 samples used, 130 were examined by the first three methods. 49 per cent were positive for one or more parasites. Of the positive samples, 67 per cent were positive for oxyurids, 28 per cent were positive for ascarids and 28 per cent were positive for protozoa (Balantidium, Nyctotherus or flagellates). Only 1/113 (0.8 per cent) samples was positive for Cryptosporidium. The most important risk factors for parasites were sex (F) and length of time (<5 years) in owner's possession. This survey showed that gastrointestinal parasites are frequently detected in the faecal samples of captive tortoises in the UK, but their prevalence may be influenced by various factors including sex, length of time owned, age and species.

AB  - This review deals with the complex sex determining system of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, governed by the interactions between a genetic determination and the influence of temperature, shown in both domestic and wild populations. Naturally sex reversed individuals are strongly suggested in two wild populations. This can be due to the masculinising temperatures which some fry encounter during their sex differentiation period when they colonise shallow waters, and/or to the influence of minor genetic factors. Differences regarding a) thermal responsiveness of sex ratios between and within Nile tilapia populations, b) maternal and paternal effects on temperature dependent sex ratios and c) nearly identical results in offspring of repeated matings, demonstrate that thermosensitivity is under genetic control. Selection experiments to increase the thermosensitivity revealed high responses in the high and low sensitive lines. The high-line showed similar to 90% males after 2 generations of selection whereas the weakly sensitive line had 54% males. This is the first evidence that a surplus of males in temperature treated groups can be selected as a quantitative trait. Expression profiles of several genes (Cyp19a, Foxl2, Amh, Sox9a,b) from the gonad and brain were analysed to define temperature action oil the sex determining/differentiating cascade in tilapia. The coexistence of GSD and TSD is discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - An adult female of Williams' mud turtle, Pelusios williamsi long-term captive, that was allegedly caught wild in Kenya was found to have developed papilloma-like skin lesions. Excised tumors were examined histologically after routine processing with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) stained slides, examined for the presence of viral particles by electron microscopy employing negative staining, and examined for the presence of viral DNA by PCR. Microscopic features in pretreatment biopsies were fully diagnostic and consistent with multifocal squamous cell papilloma. Viral-type inclusion bodies were not identified. Turtle was found to be infected by reptilian herpesvirus. Association with herpesvirus and vast multiplicity of tumors thwarted surgical solution. An autogenous vaccine was prepared using 5 g of excised fresh tissue, aseptically ground, treated with diluted formalin, centrifuged to obtain a supernatant, and subsequently exposed to UV light. Autogenous vaccine induced substantial areas of necrosis of the papillomatous lesions noted by the loss of cytological architecture, nuclear loss, and by edema. The outer edges of the healing biopsies appeared to be regenerating. Therefore, our vaccine application could be considered as effective. It is difficult to treat and eliminate herpesvirus infection because of its cryptic presence and sudden onset of disease. Successful application of autogenous vaccine could be a potentially promising strategy, which deserves further testing.

AB  - A total of 79 species of local vertebrates (birds, mammals, and reptiles) are found to be in illegal trade in the West Bank, Palestine, during 2013-2020. Data were collected from visits to the animal markets in the main cities of the West Bank (Bethlehem, Hebron, Jenin, Jericho, Nablus, Ramallah, and Salfit) and from advertisements in social media. Birds were the most traded animals represented in 59 species (74.7%), followed by 12 species of reptiles (15.2%) and eight species of mammals (10.1%). Nineteen species are listed under CITES appendices (17 birds and 2 mammals under appendixes II and III, respectively). As for the conservation status according to the IUCN Red List, two bird species (Streptopelia turtur and Serinus syriacus) and one reptile (Testudo graeca) are listed as VU, while two mammals (Hyaena hyaena and Gazella gazella) are listed as NT and EN, respectively. Based on the local status, three species of bird are considered critically endangered (Coturnix coturnix, Asio flammeus, and Aquila chrysaetos), one bird is endangered (Falco subbuteo), and two mammals (Hyaena hyaena and Gazella gazella) are considered endangered and vulnerable respectively. This study reveals the urgent need to control animal trade in the Palestinian Territories.

AB  - To test phylogenetic relationships within the genus Testudo (Testudines: Testudinidae), we have sequenced a fragment of the mitochondrial (mt) 12S rRNA gene of 98 tortoise specimens belonging to the genera Testudo, Indotestudo, and Geochelone. Maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining methods identify two main clades of Mediterranean tortoises, one composed of the species Testudo graeca, Testudo marginata, and Testudo kleinmanni and a second of Testudo hermanni, Testudo horsfieldii, and Indotestudo elongata. The first clade, but not the second, was also supported by maximum parsimony analysis. Together with the genus Geochelone, a star-like radiation of these clades was suggested, as a sister-group relationship between the two Testudo clades could not be confirmed. The intraspecies genetic variation was examined by sequencing the mt 12S rRNA fragment from 28 specimens of T. graeca and 49 specimens of T. hermanni from various geographic locations. Haplotype diversity was found to be significantly larger in T. graeca compared with T. hermanni, suggestive of reduced genetic diversity in the latter species, perhaps due to Pleistocene glaciations affecting northern and middle Europe or other sources of lineage reduction. No ancient mt 12S rRNA gene haplotypes were identified in T. graeca and/or T. hermanni originating from islands in the Mediterranean Sea, suggesting that these islands harbor tortoise populations introduced from the European and African mainland.

AB  - The Galapagos giant tortoise is an icon of the unique, endemic biodiversity of Galapagos, but little is known of its parasitic fauna. We assessed the diversity of parasitic nematode communities and their spatial distributions within four wild tortoise populations comprising three species across three Galapagos islands, and consider their implication for Galapagos tortoise conservation programmes. Coprological examinations revealed nematode eggs to be common, with more than 80% of tortoises infected within each wild population. Faecal samples from tortoises within captive breeding centres on Santa Cruz, Isabela and San Cristobal islands also were examined. Five different nematode egg types were identified: oxyuroid, ascarid, trichurid and two types of strongyle. Sequencing of the 18S small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene from adult nematodes passed with faeces identified novel sequences indicative of rhabditid and ascaridid species. In the wild, the composition of nematode communities varied according to tortoise species, which co-varied with island, but nematode diversity and abundance were reduced or altered in captive-reared animals. Evolutionary and ecological factors are likely responsible for the variation in nematode distributions in the wild. This possible species/island-parasite co-evolution has not been considered previously for Galapagos tortoises. We recommend that conservation efforts, such as the current Galapagos tortoise captive breeding/rearing and release programme, be managed with respect to parasite biogeography and host-parasite co-evolutionary processes in addition to the biogeography of the host.

AB  - Tortoises of the Testudo graeca complex inhabit a patchy range that covers part of three continents (Africa, Europe, Asia). It extends approximately 6500 kin in an east-west direction from eastern Iran to the Moroccan Atlantic coast and about 1600 km in a north-south direction from the Danube Delta to the Libyan Cyrenaica Peninsula. Recent years have seen a rapid increase of recognized taxa. Based on morphological investigations, it was suggested that this group consists of as many as 20 distinct species and is paraphyletic with respect to T. kleinmanni sensu lato and T marginata. Based on samples from representative localities of the entire range, we sequenced the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and conducted nuclear genomic fingerprinting with ISSR PCR. The T graeca complex is monophyletic and sister to a taxon consisting of T kleinmanni sensu lato and T marginata. The T graeca complex comprises six well-supported mtDNA clades (A-F). Highest diversity is found in the Caucasian Region, where four clades occur in close neighbourhood. This suggests, in agreement with the fossil record, the Caucasian Region as a radiation centre. Clade A corresponds to haplotypes from the East Caucasus. It is the sister group of another clade (B) from North Africa and western Mediterranean islands. Clade C includes haplotypes from western Asia Minor, the southeastern Balkans and the western and central Caucasus Region. Its sister group is a fourth, widely distributed clade (D) from southern and eastern Asia Minor and the Levantine Region (Near East). Two further clades are distributed in Iran (E, northwestern and central Iran; F, eastern Iran). Distinctness of these six clades and sister group relationships of (A + B) and (C + D) are well-supported; however, the phylogeny of the resulting four clades (A + B), (C + D), E and F is poorly resolved. While in a previous study (Fritz et a]., 2005a) all traditionally recognized Testudo species were highly distinct using mtDNA sequences and ISSR fingerprints, we detected within the T graeca complex no nuclear genomic differentiation paralleling mtDNA clades. We conclude that all studied populations of the T graeca complex are conspecific under the Biological Species Concept. There is major incongruence between mtDNA clades and morphologically defined taxa. Morphologically well-defined taxa, like T g. armeniaca or T g. floweri, nest within clades comprising also geographically neighbouring, but morphologically distinctive populations of other taxa (clade A: T g. armeniaca, T g. ibera, T g. pallasi; clade D: T g. anamurensis, T g. antakyensis, T g. floweri, T g. ibera, T g. terrestris), while sequences of morphologically similar tortoises of the same subspecies (T g. ibera sensu stricto or T g. ibera sensu lato) scatter over two or three genetically distinct clades (A, C or A, C, D, respectively). This implies that pronounced morphological plasticity, resulting in phenotypes shaped by environmental pressure, masks genetic differentiation. To achieve a more realistic taxonomic arrangement reflecting mtDNA clades, we propose reducing the number of T graeca subspecies considerably and regard in the eastern part of the range five subspecies as valid (T g. armeniaca, T g. buxtoni, T g. ibera, T g. terrestris, T g. zarudnyi). As not all North African taxa were included in the present study, we refrain from synonymizing North African taxa with T g. graeca (mtDNA clade B) that represents a further valid subspecies.

AB  - The condition index (CI) of the tortoises Testudo graeca, T. hermanni hermanni, T h. boettgeri and T. marginata was examined in captivity in southern and northern Europe. The CI was calculated using mass-length relationships of wild tortoises: log (M/M'), where M is observed mass and M' is mass predicted from length. The mass-length relationships differed slightly between the subspecies of T hermanni. Captive tortoises at the Centro Carapax (Italy) and the Oosterbeek Tortoise Study Centre (The Netherlands) had CI within the same range as wild tortoises, so there was no general effect of captivity on body mass condition even at densities ten times the highest observed in the wild. However, the seasonal pattern of CI at Oosterbeek differed significantly from that of wild tortoises, with a peak in late summer rather than in spring. Low CI of tortoises in some enclosures at the Centro Carapax prompted supplementary feeding before their health was affected. Tortoises at SOPTOM (France) during a period of disease had significantly lower CI than wild tortoises, with mean CI of -0.04 and mean relative mass (M/M') of 91%. The CI offers a useful guide to the health and management of captive Mediterranean tortoises, although further data are required on those kept in different circumstances, such as outdoor-only enclosures in northern Europe.

AB  - Historically, studies of reptilian thermal biology have compared ambient temperatures (T-a) to body temperatures (T-b) from the animal under study, with T-b usually taken from the cloaca and various instruments being used to measure T-b. The advent of surgically implanted miniature temperature loggers has offered the opportunity to test the efficacy of cloacal T-b as a measurement in thermoregulatory studies. We expected that there was a difference between skin, cloacal, and core T-b's. Temperatures were measured from various positions on leopard tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis) using thermocouples and miniature temperature loggers, including surgically implanted temperature loggers. Measurements of temperature from various positions on and in the tortoise were significantly different from T-a. Cloacal T-b's were significantly lower than all other body temperatures measured, and core T-b's were significantly different from cloacal T-b, skin and carapace temperatures. In addition, significant differences were found between measures of temperature from other parts of the body. The variations between core T-b, cloacal T-b and other measures of T-b indicated that there are large thermal gradients within the body of a relatively large tortoise at any given time with cloacal T-b not an accurate measure of core T-b.

AB  - The radiated tortoise (Geochelone radiata) is an endangered species endemic to the spiny forest of southern Madagascar. The main threat that this species faces is illegal harvesting for both local consumption and foreign markets. Large numbers of live individuals are often confiscated and their population of origin is in most cases unknown. Previous work has identified three genetically distinct units across the current distribution of the species. The objective of the present study was to develop a method of assigning G. radiata individuals to their original population based on the analysis of morphometric characters. We measured 39 variables on the shell of tortoises sampled at seven locations across the species range in order to assess differentiation. We employed a PCA-based method to analyze morphometric data and found three distinct groups of populations based solely on shape variation. Discriminant functions allowed for the correct classification of 83% of individuals among these groups. The abundance of tortoises, a variable strongly linked to the level of human exploitation at each site, was correlated with the morphometric differentiation of populations. Our results thus suggest that humans may have played a role in the recent evolution of radiated tortoises. The outlined methodology could become a useful tool for the management of radiated tortoises, and could theoretically be applied to any chelonian species. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The human exploitation of land resources (land use) has been considered the major factor responsible for changes in biodiversity within terrestrial ecosystems given that it affects directly the distribution of the fauna. Reptiles are known to be particularly sensitive to habitat change due to their ecological constraints. Here, the impact of land use on reptile diversity was analysed, choosing Catalonia (NE Iberia) as a case study. This region provides a suitable scenario for such a biogeographical study since it harbours: 1) a rich reptile fauna; 2) a highly diverse environment showing Strong variation in those variables usually shaping reptile distributions; and 3) good species distribution data. Potential species richness was calculated, using ecological modelling techniques (Ecological Niche Factor Analysis - ENFA). The subtraction of the observed from the potential species richness was the dependent variable in a backwards multiple linear regression, using land use variables. Agriculture was the land use with the strongest relation with the non-fulfilment of the potential species richness, indicating a trend towards a deficit of biodiversity. Deciduous forest was the only land use negatively related with the subtracted species richness. Results indicate a clear relationship between land use and biodiversity at a mesoscale. This finding represents an important baseline for conservation guidelines within the habitat change framework because it has been achieved at the same spatial scale of chorological studies and management policies.

AB  - Whole-body CO2 stores are known to increase with cooling in reptiles and amphibians (-Delta[CO2]/Delta T), The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism(s) producing this inverse relationship. The Delta[CO2]/Delta T coefficients were determined for eight reptilian and one amphibian species and were found to differ by a factor of approximately 10, from -0.21 mmol kg(-1)degrees C-1 in the Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise TestutEo graeca to -0.02 mmol kg(-1)degrees C-1 in the bullfrog Rana catesbeiana, The Delta[CO2]/Delta T coefficients were correlated with values in the literature for in vivo plasma Delta pH/Delta T coefficients (Delta[CO2]/Delta T=-0.18-8.24 Delta pH/Delta T; r(2)=0.87). Plasma electrolyte concentrations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, inorganic phosphate, SO42- and lactate), [protein], [CO2], P-CO2 and pH were measured in chronically cannulated resting black racer snakes Coluber constrictor. When the temperature was reduced from 30 to 10 degrees C, pH increased slightly (by -0.0028 pH units degrees C-1), P-CO2 decreased by 7 mmHg, [CO2] increased by 3.2 mmol l(-1) and [HPO42-+H2PO4-] increased by 0.7 mmol l(-1). Concentrations of protein and of the remaining electrolytes were not significantly different (P>0.05) at 30 and 10 degrees C. Net plasma protein charge, calculated from the principle of electroneutrality (the sum of the cations in mequiv = the sum of anions in mequiv), was -0.48 mequiv g(-1) protein at 30 degrees and -0.38 mequiv g(-1) protein at 10 degrees C, This 21 % decrease was attributed to the increases in [CO2] (i.e. carbonic acid) and inorganic phosphate concentration, Between 30 and 10 degrees C, skeletal muscle pH and [CO2] in C. constrictor increased (by -0.009 units degrees C-1 and -0.125 mmol kg(-1)degrees C-1, respectively), [Na+] and [Cl-] each decreased by approximately 12 mequiv l(-1), and [K+] and the percentage of water did not change significantly, It is concluded that the increase in whole-body CO2 stores with cooling in reptiles and amphibians results from the passive effects of temperature changes upon the ionization constants of proteins and the active adjustment of P-CO2 (ventilatory regulation), so that -Delta pK is greater than -Delta pH. Active transmembrane ion-exchange processes do not appear to be involved.

AB  - In the lungs of 12 species of Amphibia investigated so far, solitary neuroendocrine (NE) cells, as well as groups of these cells called ''neuroepithelial bodies'' (NEB), are observed. They occur in the position strategic to monitoring gas composition, mainly in the ciliated epithelium of the apical part of the septa. A great diversity in the structure of NEB is observed. The NE cells and NEB in Amphibia are predominantly of the ''closed type,'' separated from the air space by a thin cytoplasmic layer of ciliated cells, goblet cells or pneumocytes. In two species, Bufo marinus and Ambystoma tigrinum, the ''open type'' of NEB occurs, where NEB communicate with the air space, by apical cells in Bufo and type II NE cells in Ambystoma. Both types of cells possess single atypical cilia with an 8+1 microtubule arrangement and microvilli on the free surface. Single and grouped NE cells are characterized by small dense core vesicles (DCV) dispersed in the cytoplasm. In Salamandra and Ambystoma the second type of NE cells with large DCV are observed. The DCV represent sites of storage of serotonin and several neuropeptides. The basal parts of NEB and of some solitary cells are invested by the intraepithelial sensory nerve terminals, both afferent and efferent morphologically. In the lungs of Amphibia, similarly to other vertebrates, NE cells, which act as endocrine/paracrine receptors, form epithelial endocrine systems. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE
   To determine anatomic reference points for 4 turtle species and to evaluate data on relative anatomic dimensions, signal intensities (SIs), and position of selected organs within the coelomic cavity by use of MRI.
   ANIMALS
   3 turtle cadavers (1 red-eared slider [Trachemys scripta elegans], 1 yellow-bellied slider [Trachemys scripta scripta], and 1 Coastal plain cooter [Pseudemys concinna floridana]) and 63 live adult turtles (30 red-eared sliders, 20 yellow-bellied sliders, 5 Coastal plain cooters, and 8 hieroglyphic river cooters [Pseudemys concinna hieroglyphica]).
   PROCEDURES
   MRI and necropsy were performed on the 3 turtle cadavers. Physical examination, hematologic evaluation, and whole-body radiography were performed on the 63 live turtles. Turtles were sedated, and MRI in transverse, sagittal, and dorsal planes was used to measure organ dimensions, position within the coelomic cavity, and SIs. Body positioning after sedation was standardized with the head, neck, limbs, and tail positioned in maximum extension.
   RESULTS
   Measurements of the heart, liver, gallbladder, and kidneys in sagittal, transverse, and dorsal planes; relative position of those organs within the coelom; and SIs of the kidneys and liver were obtained with MRI and provided anatomic data for these 4 turtle species.
   CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
   MRI was a valuable tool for determining the position, dimensions, and SIs of selected organs. Measurement of organs in freshwater chelonians was achievable with MRI. Further studies are needed to establish reference values for anatomic structures in turtles. Results reported here may serve as guidelines and aid in clinical interpretation of MRI images for these 4 species.

AB  - Adult body size and shape were examined in almost 1400 individuals of the tortoises Testudo graeca, T. hermanni and T. marginata from Greece. The size at maturity was greater in females than in males in all three species. Maximum and mean adult sizes were also greater in females than in males in T. graeca and T. hermanni. Males grew to a larger size than females in T. marginata, and mean adult size was similar in the sexes in this species. Sexual dimorphism of shape (adjusted for size covariate) was shown in most of the characters examined, and the degree of this dimorphism differed significantly among the three species. Differences were related to their contrasting courtship behaviours: horizontal head movements and severe biting in T. marginata, vertical head bobs and carapace butting in T. graeca, and mounting and tail thrusting in T. hermanni. There was no difference in the frequency of observations of courtship or fighting among the three species, but courtship was about 10 times more common than combat in males. All species showed greatest courtship activity in autumn; copulation was rarely observed in T. hermanni (only 0.36% of courting males) and not seen in the other species in the field. Observations made throughout the activity season indicated that feeding was equally common in males and females in all three species. Differences in shape were more likely to be the result of sexual selection than of natural selection for fecundity. Detailed predictions are made for sexual dimorphism of other characters in these species.

AB  - In the European pond turtle, the incubation of eggs below 28 degrees C yields 100% phenotypic males, whereas above 29.5 degrees C 100% phenotypic females are obtained. Many data argue in favor of the involvement of steroid hormones in this phenomenon. During the thermosensitive period for sex determination, gonads are able to metabolize different steroid precursors, such as pregnenolone, progesterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone. Gonadal oestrogen content is higher at 30 degrees C than at 25 degrees C. When oestradiol benzoate (5 to 50 mu g) or oestrone (100 mu g) are injected into eggs incubated at 25 degrees C before or at the beginning of the thermosensitive period, gonads differentiate into ovaries instead of testes: an ovarian-cortex develops whereas medullary testicular cords are inhibited. Conversely, when tamoxifen (an anti oestrogen) is injected into eggs incubated at 30 degrees C, medullary testicular cords (or tubes) differentiate. Gonadal aromatase activity during the thermosensitive period increases in an exponential fashion at 30 degrees C, and remains very low at 25 degrees C. When eggs are first incubated at 25 degrees C up to a stage within this period, and then shifted to 35 degrees C (a highly feminizing temperature) for different times, the response is also exponential, showing an amplification of aromatase synthesis. Temperature could act, directly or indirectly, on the regulation of the expression of the aromatase gene. The anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) exerts an inhibitory effect on aromatase activity. The termination of the thermosensitive period could result in testes from an active synthesis of AMH, and in ovaries from high levels of oestrogens. (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The trade in wildlife and keeping of exotic pets is subject to varying levels of national and international regulation and is a topic often attracting controversy. Reptiles are popular exotic pets and comprise a substantial component of the live animal trade. High mortality of traded animals raises welfare concerns, and also has implications for conservation if collection from the wild is required to meet demand. Mortality of reptiles can occur at any stage of the trade chain from collector to consumer. However, there is limited information on mortality rates of reptiles across trade chains, particularly amongst final consumers in the home. We investigated mortality rates of reptiles amongst consumers using a specialised technique for asking sensitive questions, additive Randomised Response Technique (aRRT), as well as direct questioning (DQ). Overall, 3.6% of snakes, chelonians and lizards died within one year of acquisition. Boas and pythons had the lowest reported mortality rates of 1.9% and chameleons had the highest at 28.2%. More than 97% of snakes, 87% of lizards and 69% of chelonians acquired by respondents over five years were reported to be captive bred and results suggest that mortality rates may be lowest for captive bred individuals. Estimates of mortality from aRRT and DQ did not differ significantly which is in line with our findings that respondents did not find questions about reptile mortality to be sensitive. This research suggests that captive reptile mortality in the home is rather low, and identifies those taxa where further effort could be made to reduce mortality rates.

AB  - The postembryonic development of the turtle carapace was studied in the aquatic Emys orbicularis and the terrestrial Testudo graeca. Differences in the structure of the bony shell in aquatic and terrestrial turtles were shown to be associated with varying degrees of development of epidermal derivatives, namely, the thickness of the scutes and the depth of horny furrows. Sinking of the horny furrows into the dermis causes local changes in the structure of the collagen matrix, which might precondition the acceleration of the ossification. Aquatic turtles possess a relatively thin horny cover, whose derivatives are either weakly developed or altogether absent and thus make no noticeable impact on the growth dynamics of bony plates. Carapace plates of these turtles outgrow more or less evenly around the periphery, which results in uniform costals, relatively narrow and partly reduced neurals, and broad peripherals extending beyond the marginal scutes. In terrestrial turtles (Testudinidae), horny structures are much more developed and exert a considerable impact on the growth of bony elements. As a result, bony plates outgrow unevenly in the dermis, expanding fast in the zones under the horny furrows and slowly outside these zones. This determines the basic features of the testudinid carapace: alternately cuneate shape of costals, an alternation of broad octagonal and narrow tetragonal neurals, and the limitation of the growth of peripherals by pleuro-marginal furrows. The evolutionary significance of morphogenetic and constructional differences in the turtle carapace, and the association of these differences with the turtle habitats are discussed.

AB  - Tortoise mycoplasmosis is one of the most extensively characterized infectious diseases of chelonians. A 1989 outbreak of upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) in free-ranging Agassiz's desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) brought together an investigative team of researchers, diagnosticians, pathologists, immunologists and clinicians from multiple institutions and agencies. Electron microscopic studies of affected tortoises revealed a microorganism in close association with the nasal mucosa that subsequently was identified as a new species, Mycoplasma agassizii. Over the next 24 years, a second causative agent, Mycoplasma testudineum, was discovered, the geographic distribution and host range of tortoise mycoplasmosis were expanded, diagnostic tests were developed and refined for antibody and pathogen detection, transmission studies confirmed the pathogenicity of the original M. agassizii isolate, clinical (and subclinical) disease and laboratory abnormalities were characterized, many extrinsic and predisposing factors were found to play a role in morbidity and mortality associated with mycoplasmal infection, and social behavior was implicated in disease transmission.
   The translation of scientific research into management decisions has sometimes led to undesirable outcomes, such as euthanasia of clinically healthy tortoises. In this article, we review and assess current research on tortoise mycoplasmosis, arguably the most important chronic infectious disease of wild and captive North American and European tortoises, and update the implications for management and conservation of tortoises in the wild.

AB  - Previously, a novel, fast-growing spirochaete was isolated from the hard tick Hyalomma aegyptium, which infests tortoises (Testudo graeca), by using Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly (BSK) II medium; the tick samples were taken from the Istanbul area in northwestern Turkey [Goner et al. (2003). Microbiology 149, 2539-2544]. Here is presented a detailed characterization of the spirochaete. Electron microscopy revealed that strain IST7(T) is morphologically similar to other spirochaetes of the genus Borrelia and possesses 15 to 16 flagellae that emerge from both polar regions. PFGE analysis revealed the genome to comprise a linear chromosome of approximately 1 Mb; two large linear plasmids of approximately 145 and 140 kb, and several small plasmids ranging from 50 to 20 kb in size were also found. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of this Borrelia isolate exhibited 99.4 to 99(.)8% identity with other strains isolated from H. aegyptium and less than 99 similarity with those of other Borrelia species. A phylogenetic tree, generated from 16S rRNA gene sequences, demonstrated that the spirochaete isolates from H. aegyptium clustered together and branched off from both Lyme-disease-related and relapsing-fever-associated Borrelia species. A single copy of the rrs gene was detected in the genome of strain IST7(T) by Southern hybridization. DNA-DNA hybridization results showed that strain IST7(T) was distinct from Lyme-disease-related Borrelia, Borrelia burgdorferi and the relapsing-fever-associated species Borrelia hermsii. The G+C content of strain IST7(T) is 30.0 mol%. From these genetic features, a novel Borrelia species, Borrelia turcica sp. nov., is proposed; the type strain is IST7(T) (=JCM 11958(T)=DSM 16138(T)).

AB  - Hyalomma aegyptium ticks were collected from tortoises, Testudo graeca, at localities in northern Africa, the Balkans, and the Near and Middle East. The intensity of infestation ranged from 1-37 ticks per tortoise. The sex ratio of feeding ticks was male-biased in all tested populations. Larger tortoises carried more ticks than did the smaller tortoises. The juveniles were either not infested, or carried only a poor tick load. Hyalomma aegyptium was absent in the western Souss Valley and Ourika Valley in Morocco, the Cyrenaica Peninsula in Libya, Jordan, and the Antilebanon Mountains in Syria. Hemolivia mauritanica, a heteroxenous apicomplexan cycling between T. graeca and H. aegyptium, was confirmed in Algeria, Romania, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Iran. Its prevalence ranged from 84% in Romania (n = 45), 82% in eastern Turkey (n = 28), and 82% in the area of northwestern Syria with adjacent Turkish borderland (n = 90), to 38% in Lebanon (n = 8) and in only I of 16 sampled tortoises in Algeria. The intensity of parasitemia in the studied areas ranged from 0.01% up to 28.17%. The percentage of Hemolivia-infected erythrocytes was significantly higher in adults. All tortoises from Hyalomma-free areas were Hemolivia-negative. Remarkably, all 29 T. graeca from Jabal Duruz (southwestern Syria) and 36 T. graeca from the area north of Middle Atlas (Morocco) were Hemolivia-negative, despite the fact that ticks parasitized all adult tortoises in these localities. Identical host preferences of H. aegyptium and H. mauritanica suggest the occurrence of co-evolution within the Testudo-Hyalomma-Hemolivia host-parasite complex,

AB  - Latin American subtropical dry ecosystems have experienced significant human impact for more than a century, mainly in the form of extensive livestock grazing, forest products extraction, and agriculture expansion. We assessed the regional-scale effect of land use and land cover (LULC) on patterns of richness distribution of trees, birds, amphibians, and mammals in the Northern Argentine Dry Chaco (NADC) over c. 19 million hectares. Using species distribution models in a hierarchical framework, we modeled the distributions of 138 species. First, we trained the models for the entire Argentinean Chaco with climatic and topographic variables. Second, we modeled the same species for the NADC including the biophysical variables identified as relevant in the first step plus four LULC-related variables: woody biomass, distance to crops, density of livestock-based rural settlements (puestos), and vegetation cover. Third, we constructed species richness maps by adding the models of individual species and considering two situations, with and without LULC variables. Four, richness maps were used for assessing differences when LULC variables are added and for determining the main drivers of current patterns of species richness. We found a marked decrease in species richness of the four groups as a consequence of inclusion of LULC variables in distribution models. The main factors associated with current richness distribution patterns (both negatively) were woody biomass and density of livestock puestos. Species richness in present-day Semiarid Chaco landscapes is strongly affected by LULC patterns, even in areas not transformed to agriculture. Regional-scale biodiversity planning should consider open habitats such as grasslands and savannas in addition to woodlands.

AB  - Light and electron microscopy of the lungs of Ambystoma tigrinum (Urodela) revealed a relatively complex pattern of the neuroendocrine (NE) cells. In the apical parts of smaller septa single NE cells not associated with nerve fibres were covered and surrounded by pneumocytes. The larger septa possessed small areas of ciliated epithelium, in which the NE cells were grouped in a form of neuroepithelial bodies (NEB) consisting of 3-5 cells and covered by goblet cells. NE cells possessed a large nucleus with patches of condensed chromatin, clear cytoplasm, and membrane-bound vesicles of variable morphology and size, containing an electron dense interior surrounded by a lucent space. The size of these dense core vesicles (DCV) ranged from 70-140 nm, while rarely the larger ones exhibited a diameter of 300-600 nm. In some NEB a second type of NE cells was observed for the first time in an amphibian species: these cells communicated with the air space and exhibited on their surface microvilli and a single modified cilium with a 8 + 1 microtubule arrangement. Their cytoplasm contained two types of DCV: dense core granules with a diameter of 140-260 nm and vesicles 320-700 nm in diameter with a moderately electron dense interior. The NEB were associated with intracorpuscular, sensory nerve terminals morphologically afferent and efferent. By immunocytochemistry, the NE cells revealed the presence of serotonin, met-enkephalin, and leu-enkephalin. A paracrine and chemoreceptor role is proposed for NEB of Ambystoma tigrinum.

AB  - Plasma biochemical values are routinely used in the medical management of ill reptiles, and for monitoring the health of clinically normal animals. Laboratory tests, including clinical biochemical values, Lire subject to biological and analytical variation, the magnitude of which determines the utility of population-based reference ranges for the detection of abnormal results in the individual animal. Nested analysis of variance of repeated measurements allows the variance to be broken into within-individual, between-individual, and analytical variation. When the within-individual variation is large and the interindividual variation is low, a sample may be accurately classified as normal or abnormal based on a population-based reference interval. However, if the intraindividual variation is low and the interindividual variation high, population-based reference intervals are of limited value as the ranges for an individual encompass only a part of the conventional reference interval. Between-lizard, within-lizard, and analytical components of variance were assessed by nested analysis of variance for 16 commonly measured plasma biochemical parameters in eight healthy adult Dumeril's monitors (Varanus dumerili). Albumin, cholesterol, phosphate, calcium, sodium, and total protein demonstrated levels of individuality suggesting that comparison of a single measurement to a conventional population-based reference range may be too insensitive to detect small but significant alterations in the value for that animal. Only for potassium and AST did the index of individuality suggest that the use of reference values may be warranted. Uric acid, globulin, glucose, and amylase fell in a gray zone, where population-based ranges should be used with caution. The critical difference indicates the difference between two consecutive analytical results that may be safely ascribed to natural variation. In the present study critical difference varied from 7 and 11%, respectively, for sodium and chloride to 75 and 125% for uric acid and AST.

AB  - Background: Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) and Tacheng tick virus-1 (TcTV-1) are emerging tick-borne viruses that have been recently confirmed to be etiological agents of human disease in China. However, the ecology of JMTV and TcTV-1, especially their association with ticks in wildlife and livestock, remains largely unknown in Turkey.Materials and Methods: Eight hundred thirty-two tick specimens in 117 pools were collected in Turkey between 2020 and 2022 from wildlife (Miniopterus schreibersii and Rhinolophus hipposideros; n = 10, 1.2%; Testudo graeca; n = 50, 6%) and livestock (Ovis aries and Capra aegagrus hircus; n = 772, 92.7%). The specimens were individually screened for JMTV and TcTV-1 using nRT-PCR assays targeting the partial genes.Results: JMTV was detected in one Ixodes simplex pool and two Rhipicephalus bursa pools collected from central and Aegean provinces, respectively. TcTV-1 was identified in five Hyalomma aegyptium pools collected in Mediterranean provinces. No coinfection was detected in the tick pools. Maximum likelihood analysis of JMTV partial segment 1 sequences reveal that these sequences form a separate cluster together with viruses previously characterized in Turkey and the Balkan Peninsula. The phylogenetic analysis of the TcTV-1 nucleocapsid sequences indicates that they are closely related to viruses in ticks, sheep, cattle, and humans in China, but form a separate group among themselves.Conclusion: This study provides the first molecular evidence of TcTV-1 in Hy. aegyptium in Turkey. In addion, these findings indicate that JMTV and TcTV-1 extend ticks species and geographic distributions. Thus, multiregional surveillance in livestock and wildlife is needed to evaluate potential tick vectors and the human health impact of these viruses in Turkey.

AB  - Objectives: To study, the cytotoxic effects of some biological and chemical agents on G1, S, G2, M and Go phases of liver and colon carcinomas and myosarcoma cells obtained with chemical carcinogens dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) and cadmium chloride.
   Methods: Eight rabbit livers, colon carcinoma an myosarcoma cell lines were obtained by injection of DMBA in the Biology Laboratory, of the University of Dumlupinar, Kutahya, Turkey between January 2001 and June 2003. All lines were grown at 37degreesC and 5% carbon dioxide in sterile RPMI-1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum after addition of glutamate, penicillin (50 units/ml) and streptomycin (50 mug/ml) (complete medium). Cells were grown on standard tissue culture plastic flasks to 80% confluence and passed by trypsinization.
   Results: Tortoise (Testudo graeca) shell, sponge (Geodia cydonium), medusa (Aurelia aurita), meat flies (Calliphora erythrocephala) larva, frog (Rana ridibunda) larva and juniper (Juniperus communis) berry extracts killed a large amount of the liver and colon carcinomas and the myosarcoma cells in G2, M and G0 phases (p<0.01). The mistletoe (Viscum album) extract had more effect in only the Go phase (p<0.05). Genistein, genistin, glycitein, glycitin, daitzein and daitzin have significantly decreased in the cancer cells tests, particularly, genistein and daitzein caused the apoptotic effect in G2, M and Go phases (p<0.01). Cesium chloride, a mixture of cesium chloride with magnesium chloride had the most effect on tumor cells (p<0.01). AzhexSi, Azhex-AzhepSi, Et-Azhex-AzhepSi, AzhepSi, Hexamine and DL 54 have been inhibited in various levels of the cancer cells (p<0.05, p<0.01).
   Conclusions: This data suggest that some biological extracts and chemicals tested may be useful chemotherapeutic agents to inhibit the growth of cancer cells. This study sheds some light for new anti cancerogenic experiments preventing various cancers on humans.

AB  - Background: Neuro-epithelial bodies (NEB) are corpuscles of currently equivocal function which are present in the lungs of vertebrates. Comparative studies may help to elucidate their role.
   Methods: The NEB of Basiliscus vittatus (Reptilia, Iguanidae), a terrestrial lower vertebrate able to dive, are for the first time examined by electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry, and for argyrophilia.
   Results: Most NEB contain both immunoreactive calcitonin and serotonin but are not labelled with argyrophilia or immunocytochemistry against calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5), or the Leu-7 epitope (Leu-7). Therefore, in NEB of this species, the transcription of the calcitonin/CGRP gene exclusively favors the expression of calcitonin and this is in contrast to the intrapulmonary small neurons. Also, a physiologic difference is expected in the metabolism of ubiquitin in NEB of B. vittatus vs. mammalian NEB and neurons. In addition, the NEB cells are always covered by at least a thin cytoplasmic extension of a neighbouring cell, indicating that luminal contact is not required. Stronger still, it appears that in some lower vertebrates contact to the airspace is avoided. Finally, we provide ultrastructural evidence for the basket-like innervation of NEB in some reptiles. This way of innervation possibly represents an evolutionarily different concept for interaction between NEB corpuscular cells and nerve fibers.
   Conclusions: Beyond the confirmation that morphology, content of biologically active substances such as serotonin and calcitonin, and innervation are evolutionary well preserved features of NEB, the results reveal some intriguing features of B. vittatus NEB: strict separation of calcitonin and CGRP, reduced need for the de-ubiquitinating enzyme PGP 9.5, lack of luminal contact, and the basket-like innervation. The latter two properties possibly refer to a mechanoreceptor function of NEB in this species. (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to estimate the level of hard tick infestation in the tortoise subspecies Testudo hermanni boettgeri living within the free-range hills and mountains of four regions of central and south Albania. In addition, this study showed the morphological differences of infested and non-infested tortoises in several geographic locations where tortoises are known to be infested with Hyalomma aegyptium, a natural carrier of different zoonotic pathogens. Thirty-six of 145 (24.8%) examined Hermann's tortoises were found to be infested with hard ticks. After the tortoises were carefully captured and controlled, a total of 67 H. aegyptium were collected: 47 in Berati, 11 in Ballshi and 9 in Saranda. None of the 40 tortoises in the Tirana region were found to be infested with ticks. All ticks were identified as H. aegyptium adults. The highest prevalence of tick infestation was in the Berati region at 49.1%, followed by the Ballshi and Saranda region by 24% and 12%, respectively. The mean infestation intensity was 1.86 H. aegyptium per Hermann's tortoise, and it was found that H. aegyptium are less common in large Hermann's tortoises. The number of H. aegyptium male ticks was negatively correlated with the body dimensions of Hermann's tortoises. Hyalomma aegyptium is the most prevalent tick in Hermann's tortoises in three regions of south Albania, and with a typical three-host life cycle in different wild and domestic animals, they may be a vector of zoonotic pathogens. Furthermore, other studies should be conducted to detect the presence of zoonotic pathogens in ticks from these regions and to estimate the risk of transmission in animals and humans.

AB  - Environmental pollution has an especially high impact on wildlife. This is especially the case in industrialized countries. Although, many species within the European Union benefit from protection by the Habitats Directive, no special consideration is given to possible detrimental effects of pesticides. This is in particular remarkable as negative effects, which may lead to a regional diversity loss, have already been identified in laboratory and mesocosm studies. We conducted a pesticide exposure risk evaluation for all European reptile species with sufficient literature data on the considered biological and ecological aspects and occurrence data within agricultural areas with regular pesticide applications (102 out of 141). By using three evaluation factors (i) pesticide exposure, (ii) physiology and (iii) life history a taxon-specific pesticide exposure risk factor (ERF) was created. The results suggest that about half of all evaluated species, and thus at least 1/3 of all European species exhibited a high exposure risk. At the same time, two of them (Mauremys leprosa and Testudo graeca) are globally classified as threatened with extinction in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Variation regarding species occurrence in exposed landscapes between pesticide admission zones within the EU is rather large. This variation is mainly caused by differing land use and species abundances between zones. At the taxonomic level, significant differences in exposure risk can be observed between threatened and non-threatened species, which can be explained by the formers remote distribution areas. Lizards display the highest sensitivity toward pesticides, although no differences in overall ERFs can be observed between taxonomic groups. By identifying species at above-average risk to pesticide exposure, species-based risk evaluations can improve conservation actions for reptiles from cultivated landscapes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Context: The importance of traditional medicine cannot be over emphasized as a quarter of prescription drugs globally are natural based. In this type of medicine, plants are mixed together or are sometimes used in combination with other materials such as animals and minerals, as remedy. While a considerable amount of documentation of indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants has been executed, there is paucity of similar studies on animals in Nigeria.
   Aims: To carry out a survey of ethnozoology among the Epie-Atissa and Ogbia people of Bayelsa State, Nigeria, with a view to documenting species with zoo-therapeutic values.
   Methods: Using a semi-structured questionnaire, information was gathered through personal interviews with traditional medical practitioners. The data were evaluated using some ethnozoological indices such as use value of the species, family use value, relative frequency of citation, relative number of use, relative importance index, and cultural importance (CI).
   Results: A total of 43 species of animals belonging to three phyla, Chordata (66.7%), Arthropoda (22.2%) and Mollusca and Pisces (15.9%) were gathered in ten classes with Mammalia being the most mentioned (22.7%) followed by Reptilia (18.2%) and Pisces (15.9%). The most important diseases cited were inflammation/pain/arthritis (20.0%), ear/nose/throat (18.3%), reproductive purpose (16.7%) and convulsion/epilepsy (15.0%) while the most culturally important animals (CI) included Agama agama (0.85), Protopterus dolloi (0.45), Testudo graeca (0.23), Gorilla gorilla (0.17), Hemachatus haemachatus (0.14) and Hemidactylus frenatus (0.14).
   Conclusions: The survey furnishes the populace including medicinal plant researchers and some other traditional medicine practitioners with a real wellspring of communicable knowledge. These medicinal animal materials could be included in the healthcare delivery system of the country.

AB  - The aim of the investigations was to draw up reference blood values of European tortoises, which are more and more frequent patients in veterinary practice. Blood samples were taken from the Vena jugularis from 229 clinically healthy adult European tortoises, belonging to the species Testudo hermanni, T. graeca, T. marginata and Agrionemys horsfieldii. Blood samples were taken during the period of a year. The following 31 parameters were examined (results = mean value +/- standard deviation): haemoglobin (7.84 +/- 1.86 g/dl), PCV (28.0 +/- 6.1%), red cell count (0.63 +/- 0.19 x 10(6)/mul) and white cell count (8.73 +/- 6.86 x 10(3)/mul) including differentiation of lymphocytes, heterophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, calcium (8.7 +/- 6.7 mg/dl), magnesium (5.1 +/- 2.5 mg/dl), phosphorus (5.1 +/- 3.1 mg/dl), alkaline phosphatase (445 +/- 293 IU/l), alanine aminotransferase (22 +/- 18 IU/l), aspartate aminotransferase (108 +/- 79 IU/l), gamma-glutamyltansferase (0 IU/l), lactate dehydrogenase (1433 +/- 1029 IU/l), creatine kinase (1156 +/- 1379 IU/l), amylase (190 +/- 96 IU/l), lipase (57 +/- 42 IU/l), glucose (67.9 +/- 38.1 mg/dl), total protein (4.6 +/- 1.6 mg/dl), albumin (1.6 +/- 0.8 mg/dl), globulin (2.9 mg/dl), urea (18.1 +/- 55.9 mg/dl), uric acid (3.2 +/- 1.9 mg/dl), ammonia (519 +/- 314 mu mol/l), creatinine (0.14 +/- 0.15 mg/dl), cholesterol (141 +/- 70 mg/dl), triglycerides (285 +/- 264 mg/dl) and total bilirubin (0 mg/dl). Nine parameters showed statistically significant differences between sexes. 14 parameters showed more or less clearly distinct statistically significant seasonal variations. Species specific variations occurred in 11 parameters. 20 parameters were influenced by the conditions of husbandry. Blood samples may yield valuable information especially on infections, renal and liver disease in tortoises.

AB  - We compared the muscular anatomy of the distal front limb in terrestrial and aquatic chelonians to test whether observed differences between the two groups are associated with their divergent lifestyles and locomotor modes. Given the different use of the forelimb in the two environments (body support and propulsion on land vs. mainly propulsion in water) we expected that: (1) aquatic and terrestrial turtles would show differences in their muscular anatomy, with aquatic species having more individualized muscle bundles to allow for the complex forearm movements observed during swimming, and (2) that terrestrial turtles would have more robust muscles to support their body weight against gravity. To address these questions, we examined the forelimb myology and associated tissues in six aquatic or semi-aquatic turtles (Phyrnops hilarii, Podocnemis unifilis, Trachemys scripta, Sacalia bealei, Cuora amboinensis and Mauremys caspica) and six terrestrial or semi-terrestrial turtles (Geochelone chilensis, Testudo graeca, Cuora galbinifrons, Glyptemys insculpta, Terrapene carolina and Rhinoclemmys pulcherrima). This paper describes the general structure of the forelimb musculature in all species, and quantifies muscle masses in those species with more than five specimens available (Ph. hilarii, Po. unifilis and Ge. chilensis). The general structure of the forelimb muscles in the strictly terrestrial species Ge. chilensis and Tes. graeca was found to be notably different from the pattern of the aquatic and semi-aquatic species examined, showing a distinct fusion of the different muscular bodies. Ter. carolina also show a distinctly terrestrial pattern, but a less extensive tendon development. R. pulcherrima and Gl. insculpta were found to be morphologically intermediate; in the geoemydids the strictly terrestrial bauplan never appears. Quantitative differences in the robustness or mass of the distal forelimb muscles were also observed for the species investigated, supporting our prediction that the extensor muscles are more robust in terrestrial turtles. However, in contrast to our expectations, not only the extensor muscles of the distal forelimb (which are crucial in providing both body support and propulsion), but all muscles acting around the wrist were found to be heavier in terrestrial turtles.

AB  - Grass snakes (Natrix natrix) represent one of the most widely distributed snake species of the Palaearctic region, ranging from the North African Maghreb region and the Iberian Peninsula through most of Europe and western Asia eastward to the region of Lake Baikal in Central Asia. Within N.natrix, up to 14 distinct subspecies are regarded as valid. In addition, some authors recognize big-headed grass snakes from western Transcaucasia as a distinct species, N.megalocephala. Based on phylogenetic analyses of a 1984-bp-long alignment of mtDNA sequences (ND4+tRNAs, cyt b) of 410 grass snakes, a nearly range-wide phylogeography is presented for both species. Within N.natrix, 16 terminal mitochondrial clades were identified, most of which conflict with morphologically defined subspecies. These 16 clades correspond to three more inclusive clades from (i) the Iberian Peninsula plus North Africa, (ii) East Europe and Asia and (iii) West Europe including Corso-Sardinia, the Apennine Peninsula and Sicily. Hypotheses regarding glacial refugia and postglacial range expansions are presented. Refugia were most likely located in each of the southern European peninsulas, Corso-Sardinia, North Africa, Anatolia and the neighbouring Near and Middle East, where the greatest extant genetic diversity occurs. Multiple distinct microrefugia are inferred for continental Italy plus Sicily, the Balkan Peninsula, Anatolia and the Near and Middle East. Holocene range expansions led to the colonization of more northerly regions and the formation of secondary contact zones. Western Europe was invaded from a refuge within southern France, while Central Europe was reached by two distinct range expansions from the Balkan Peninsula. In Central Europe, there are two contact zones of three distinct mitochondrial clades, and one of these contact zones was theretofore completely unknown. Another contact zone is hypothesized for Eastern Europe, which was colonized, like north-western Asia, from the Caucasus region. Further contact zones were identified for southern Italy, the Balkans and Transcaucasia. In agreement with previous studies using morphological characters and allozymes, there is no evidence for the distinctiveness of N.megalocephala. Therefore, N.megalocephala is synonymized with N.natrix.

AB  - In studies of animal ecology, it is fashionable to use the residuals from an ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression of body mass against a linear measure of size (the body size indicator, BSI) as an index of body condition. These residual indices are used to study the relationship between condition and reproductive investment, survivorship, habitat use, and other parameters. I identify a series of key assumptions underlying the use of this method, each of which is likely to be violated in some or all studies. These assumptions are: (1) that the functional relationship between mass and BSI is linear; (2) that condition is independent of BSI length; (3) that BSI length accurately indicates structural size; (4) that there is no correlation between the size of BSI relative to other structural components (i.e., shape) and the parameter against which the residuals are analyzed; (5) that BSI length is strictly independent of mass: and (6) that BSI length is not subjected to error. Violations of these assumptions place the results of some studies in question and explain the poor relationship observed between OLS residuals and more direct measures of condition.
   I use avian morphometric data to illustrate how OLS methods can easily lead to Type I and Type II errors through violations of assumptions (5) and (6). Significant relationships reported between OLS residual indices and parameters correlating with body size (e.g., size of sexual ornaments or egg size) are at particular risk of being spurious when the correlation coefficient between mass and BSI is low. Residual indices of condition are often likely to be more reliable when calculated with alternative methods such as nonparametric or model II regression. However, whatever the method used to produce them, residual indices are not suitable for studying the heritability of condition.

AB  - Differences in the allometric scaling between gut capacity (with body mass. BM1.00) and food intake (with BM0.75) should theoretically result in a scaling of digesta retention time with BM0.25 and therefore a higher digestive efficiency in larger herbivores. This concept is an important part of the so-called 'Jarman-Bell principle' (JBP) that explains niche differentiation along a body size gradient in terms of digestive physiology. Empirical data in herbivorous mammals, however, do not confirm the scaling of retention time, or of digestive efficiency, with body mass. Here, we test these concepts in herbivorous reptiles, adding data of an experiment that measured food intake, digesta retention, digestibility and gut capacity in 23 tortoises (Testudo graeca, T. hermanni, Geochelone nigra, G. sulcata, Dipsochelys dussumieri) across a large BM range (0.5-180 kg) to a literature data collection. While dry matter gut fill scaled to BM1.07 and dry matter intake to BM0.76, digesta mean retention time (MRT) scaled to BM0.17; the scaling exponent was not significantly different from zero for species >1 kg. Food intake level was a major determinant of MRT across reptiles and mammals. In contrast to dietary fibre level. BM was not a significant contributor to dry matter digestibility in a General Linear Model. Digestibility coefficients in reptiles depended on diet nutrient composition in a similar way as described in mammals. Although food intake is generally lower and digesta retention longer in reptiles than in mammals, digestive functions scale in a similar way in both clades, indicating universal principles in herbivore digestive physiology. The reasons why the theoretically derived JBP has little empirical support remain to be investigated. Until then, the JBP should not be evoked to explain niche differentiation along a body size axis in terms of digestive physiology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Between August 1993 and September 1995, 24 gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) were received for pathological evaluations from various locations in Florida (USA). All tortoises were examined for clinical signs of upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) including nasal and ocular discharge, palpebral edema, and conjunctivitis. Of the 24 tortoises, 10 had current or previously observed clinical signs of URTD and 14 did not. A bleed sample was drawn for detection of anti mycoplasma antibodies by ELISA, and nasal lavage samples were collected for culture and detection of Mycoplasma agassizii gene sequences by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Of the 14 clinically healthy tortoises, eight were sero-, culture- and PCR-negative, and sis were seropositive for antibodies against M. agassizii. Of those six, five were culture- and/or PCR-positive for M. agassizii, and one was culture- and PCR-negative. OF the 10 ill tortoises, nine were seropositive by the ELISA and one was in the suspect range. Nine of the ill tortoises, including the suspect tortoise, were culture- and/or PCR-positive for M. agassizii, and one was culture- and PCR-negative. For histologic evaluation and discussion. the eight sero-, culture-, and PCR-negative tortoises were designated URTD-negative, and the other 16 were classified as URTD-positive. Histologic evaluation of the upper respiratory tract (URT) indicated the presence of mild to severe inflammatory, hyperplastic, or dysplastic changes in 14 URTD-positive tortoises. Seven of eight URTD-negative tortoises had normal appearing nasal cavities; one had mild inflammatory changes. Transmission electron microscopy revealed an organism consistent with Mycoplasma spp. on the nasal mucosal surface of tortoises with clinical signs and Lesions of URTD. Additionally, Gram-negative bacteria were isolated more frequently from the nasal cavities of URTD-positive tortoises than URTD-negative tortoises. Because clinical signs of URTD were never observed in sir of the URTD-positive tortoises, we also conclude that subclinical URTD can occur in gopher tortoises.

AB  - Turtles provide excellent models for studies of life history strategies, but terrestrial species are underrepresented in these analyses. We present a life table and demographic parameters of an inland population of Gopherus berlandieri to contribute to the study of evolution of turtle life histories. Data were gathered during a mark-recapture and radiotelemetry study in the Tamaulipan Biotic Province in southern Texas, USA. A total of 835 individuals were captured, measured, and their ages estimated. Females matured at 131 mm carapace length at an average of 5 yr of age (range: 4-8 yr). Clutch size, as determined by ultrasound, averaged 2.07 +/- 0.15 eggs (n = 49). No nests were found, and we estimated clutch frequency with a quadratic model to be 1.34 clutches female(-1).year(-1). Survival was estimated from age frequency regression and telemetry. Annual male survival (0.828, 0.834) differed (P < 0.05) from female survival (0.728, 0.774) for both techniques of estimation. Age-specific female survival ranged from 0.62 to 0.83 for 5- to 15-yr-old tortoises. Differential mortality of sexes led to a male-biased sex ratio in older age classes. Age structures of captured individuals did not vary (P > 0.05) among years, and population estimates did not differ among years; therefore, we constructed a life table under the assumption of a stationary population (r = 0.0). Under this assumption, survival from nest to age 4 yr must be at least 0.245, with hatchling survival of 0.528 to maintain a stationary population. Gopherus berlandieri matured at an earlier age, had smaller clutch sizes, and exhibited lower rates of female survival than other Gopherus species. We propose a physiological mechanism for lower female survival that implies trade-offs among egg size, subsequent hatchling survival, and female health. We maintain that high hatchling survival is necessary for population persistence. In an evolutionary context, we theorize that the selective advantages of small size and the life history strategies of G. berlandieri have been and are critical to its persistence.

AB  - Reptile-associated human salmonellosis cases have increased recently in the United States. It is not uncommon to find healthy chelonians shedding Salmonella enterica. The rate and frequency of bacterial shedding are not fully understood, and most studies have focused on captive vs. free-living chelonians and often in relation to an outbreak. Their ecology and significance as sentinels are important to understanding Salmonella transmission. In 2012-2013, Salmonella prevalence was determined for free-living aquatic turtles in man-made ponds in Clarke and Oconee Counties, in northern Georgia (USA) and the correlation between species, basking ecology, demographics (age/sex), season, or landcover with prevalence was assessed. The genetic relatedness between turtle and archived, human isolates, as well as, other archived animal and water isolates reported from this study area was examined. Salmonella was isolated from 45 of 194 turtles (23.2%, range 14-100%) across six species. Prevalence was higher in juveniles (36%) than adults (20%), higher in females (33%) than males (18%), and higher in bottom-dwelling species (31%; common and loggerhead musk turtles, common snapping turtles) than basking species (15%; sliders, painted turtles). Salmonella prevalence decreased as forest cover, canopy cover, and distance from roads increased. Prevalence was also higher in low-density, residential areas that have 20-49% impervious surface. A total of 9 different serovars of two subspecies were isolated including 3 S. enterica subsp. arizonae and 44 S. enterica subsp. enterica (two turtles had two serotypes isolated from each). Among the S. enterica serovars, Montevideo (n = 13) and Rubislaw (n = 11) were predominant. Salmonella serovars Muenchen, Newport, Mississippi, Inverness, Brazil, and Paratyphi B. var L(+) tartrate positive (Java) were also isolated. Importantly, 85% of the turtle isolates matched pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns of human isolates, including those reported from Georgia. Collectively, these results suggest that turtles accumulate Salmonella present in water bodies, and they may be effective sentinels of environmental contamination. Ultimately, the Salmonella prevalence rates in wild aquatic turtles, especially those strains shared with humans, highlight a significant public health concern.

AB  - Background: Exotic reptiles such as tortoises, have become increasingly common domestic pets worldwide and are known to host different gastrointestinal parasites. Some of these parasites bear zoonotic potential. In the present survey, we parasitologically examined tortoise faecal samples (n = 1005) from 19 different species held as pets in private German households and German zoological gardens.
   Methods: Saline faecal smears were used to generate prevalence data for potentially health-compromising gastrointestinal parasites. In addition, we performed complete parasitological dissections of dead tortoises (n = 49) to estimate endoparasite burdens precisely.
   Results: Analysed tortoise faecal samples contained a broad spectrum of endoparasites. We detected ten taxa of endoparasites; oxyurid nematodes (e.g. Tachygonetria spp.) were the most prevalent parasites in faecal samples (43.18%), followed by ascarids (Angusticaecum spp.) (0.01%), Hexamita spp. (0.007%), Balantidium spp. (0.007%), trichomonads (0.004%), Strongyloides spp. (0.003%), Entamoeba spp. (0.005%), Hartmanella spp. (0.001%), Blastocystis spp. (0.002%), heterakids (0.001%) and Trimitus spp. (0.001%). Additionally, we investigated dead tortoise individuals (n = 49; of 10 different species) for aetiological diagnosis and estimation of endoparasite burden. Of these individuals, 38 (77.6%) were infected with parasites and 14 (28.6%) of them died most probably due to severe parasitic infection. Oxyurid infections correlated positively with calcium deficiency and metabolic bone disease (MBD) as well as nephrosis/nephritis, mainly occurring in juvenile tortoises (< 5 years of age).
   Conclusions: The saline faecal smear technique proved to be efficient in detecting different metazoan and protozoan parasite stages in tortoise faeces. The prevalence of oxyurid infections was particularly high. In combination with pathological findings in clinical oxyuridosis obtained from necropsied animals, our findings call for further, detailed investigations on pathogenesis and immunology of oxyurids in pet reptiles. Coprological analyses for parasite detection should be mandatory before tortoises are transferred to a new owner, animal group, or public and private enclosures such as zoos. We advocate for regular health screenings in pet tortoises and, if parasitic infections are diagnosed, adequate medication or alternative hygiene management should be considered to improve and maintain individual and population health.

AB  - Background Recent reports have demonstrated the presence of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) genomic material in Hyalomma aegyptium ticks feeding primarily on tortoises belonging to the genus Testudo. This raises the question if these ticks and their hosts play a role in the natural transmission dynamics of CCHFV. However, the studies are limited, and assessing the relevance of H. aegyptium in perpetuating the virus in nature, and a potential spillover to humans remains unknown. This study aimed to detect CCHFV in H. aegyptium ticks and their tortoise hosts in the East Thrace region of Turkey, where H. aegyptium is the most common human-biting tick and where a high density of tortoises of the genus Testudo can be found. Methods During the study period, 21 blood samples from different tortoises (2 T. hermanni and 19 T. graeca), 106 tick pools (containing 448 males, 152 females, 93 nymphs and 60 larvae) collected from 65 tortoises (5 T. hermanni and 60 T. graeca), 38 adult unfed questing ticks (25 males and 13 females, screened individually) and 14 pools (containing 8 nymphs and 266 larvae) of immature unfed questing ticks collected from the ground were screened for CCHFV genome by nested PCR and partial genomes sequenced. Results As a result of the screening of these 179 samples, 17 (9.5%) were detected as positive as follows: 2 of 21 blood samples (9.52%), 13 (containing 18 nymphs in 3 pools, and 52 males and 8 females in 10 pools) of 106 tick pools from tortoises (12.26%), and 2 of 38 adult questing ticks (5.26%). No positive result was determined in 14 pools of immature questing ticks. Conclusions Previous studies have shown that reptiles can participate in the transmission of arthropod-borne viruses, but they may contribute to different aspects of the disease ecology and evolution of tick-borne viral pathogens. Our results indicate the presence of CCHFV in questing and feeding H. aegyptium ticks as well as tortoise hosts. This may indicate that CCHFV circulates in a cryptic transmission cycle in addition to the primary transmission cycle that could play a role in the natural dynamic of the virus and the transmission to humans.

TI  - The role of Virus "X" (Tortoise Picornavirus) in kidney disease and shell weakness syndrome in European tortoise species determined by experimental infection
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Tortoise Picornavirus (ToPV) commonly known as Virus "X" was recently discovered in juvenile European tortoises suffering from soft carapace and plastron as well as kidney disease. Therefore, this virus was a potential candidate to be a causative agent for these disease patterns. Spur thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) seemed to be more susceptible to establish clinical symptoms than other European species like T. hermanni. Thus this trial investigated the role of ToPV in the described syndrome. Two groups of juvenile European tortoises (T. graeca and T. hermanni) each of 10 animals, were cloacally, oronasally and intracoelomically inoculated with an infectious dose (similar to 2000 TICD) of a ToPV strain isolated from a diseased T. graeca. A control group of two animals of each species received non-infected cell culture supernatant. The tortoises were examined daily and pharyngeal and cloacal swabs for detection of ToPV-RNA by RT-PCR were taken from each animal every six days for a period of 6 months. At the end of the study the remaining animals were euthanised and dissected. Bacteriological and parasitological tests were performed and organ samples of all tortoises were investigated by RT-PCR for the presence of ToPV and histopathology. Animals that were euthanised at the end of the experiment, were examined for presence of specific anti-ToPV antibodies. Several animals in both inoculated groups showed retarded growth and a light shell weakness, in comparison to the control animals. Three animals were euthanised during the trial, showing reduced weight gain, retarded growth, severe shell weakness and apathy, in parallel to clinical observations in naturally infected animals. In all inoculated animals of both species an intermittent virus shedding, starting from 18 days post inoculation (d.p.i.), till 164 d.p.i. was detected, while the control animals remained negative. The virus was successfully reisolated in terrapene heart cell culture in 16 of 20 inoculated animals of both species. Histopathology of most inoculated animals revealed a lack of bone remodeling and vacuolisation in kidney tubuli which supports the described pathogenesis of nephropathy and osteodystrophy. Anti-ToPV antibody titres ranged from 1:2 to > 1:256 in 13 of 20 animals, whereas all control animals were seronegative. The study proofed the Henle Koch's postulates of ToPV as causative agent for shell dystrophy and kidney disease in both testudo species. The proposed species specific sensitivity towards clinical disease was not observed.

AB  - A series of studies was carried out to elucidate the relationship between the microscopic anatomy of the alimentary canal and the food habits in reptiles. Three reptiles were chosen according to different feeding habits, Uromastyx is a herbivouous, Chameleon is an insectivorous, while Crocodilys is a carnivorous reptile. So, it is obvious that the anatomy as well as the histology of the alimentary tract of reptiles demonstrate certain specific characteristics of functional adaptations as a reflection of the herbivorous, carnivorous and insectivorous mode of feeding. The anatomical and histological study of the alimentary canal of Uromastyx aegyptiaca was carried out. A comparison between the different histological structures found and those known in other reptiles was done. The straight oesophagus is lined with ciliated epithelium and goblet cells, leading to the stomach which consists of two portions, fundic or oxyntic and pyloric or mucous. The small intestine is comparatively short although the animal is purely herbivorous. It consists of the duodenum and ileum. The duodenual mucosa is in the form of leaf-like villi provided with shallow branched Lieberkuhn crypts at their bases. The ileum is devoid of found glands. The large intestine is formed of a well developed large caecum, colon and rectum. At the posterior edge of the caecum there is a small blind sac which is considered as the appendix. The caecum which is devoid of glands is lined with simple columnar cells of a special type. While the ileo -caecal valve is in the form of a characteristic well developed protrusion, the caeco-colic valve is formed of a flap arising from one side. The mucosa of the colon is folded and lined with goblet and columnar cells, while that of the rectum is, more or less, straight and is rich in goblet cells and lymph spaces. The distribution and localization of different carbohydrate categories (PAS-positive material, mucopolysaccharides) were studied in the mucosal epithelium of the alimentary canal of Uromastyx aegeptiaca. The goblet cells of the oesophagus are rich in acid mucpolysacharides, those of the small and large intestine contained smaller amounts. Neutral mucpolysacharides were found in small to moderate amounts, being most obvious in the gastric mucosa. Mode of feeding as well as habitat, show, more or less a close similarity in the histochemical pattern of their gut mucosa as regards to the distribution and localization of proteins and nucleic acids.

AB  - The world-famous markets of Marrakech, also known in Arabic as souks, harbor a vast diversity of reptiles that are sold for medicinal/magic/pet purposes or used for snake charming. This unique epidemiological context has never been studied considering the interactions of humans, reptiles, and zoonotic pathogens. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify the parasites and pathogens present in blood and feces associated with handled reptiles in the markets of Marrakech to assess the risk of zoonotic transmission within the reptile-human interface. Privately owned reptiles (n = 118), coming from vendors or snake charmers, were examined and blood and feces sampled. DNA was extracted and molecular screening (cPCR, nPCR, qPCR, dqPCR) was performed aiming to identify potentially zoonotic pathogens (i.e., Anaplasma/Ehrlichia spp., Rickettsia spp., Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Coxiella burnetii, Babesia/Theileria spp., Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., Leishmania spp., Cestoda). Overall, 28.9% (34/118) of reptiles were positive for at least one pathogen. In blood, Anaplasma spp. were detected in four snakes, with two Montpellier snakes positive for Anaplasma phagocytophilum, while Rickettsia spp. were detected in one Mediterranean chameleon and four puff adders. Leishmania tarentolae was molecularly detected in a Mediterranean chameleon and a Montpellier snake. In feces, the cox1 gene generated a myriad of sequences for nematodes, cestodes, fungi and bacteria. Importantly, Proteus vulgaris was identified from a Mediterranean chameleon. Cryptosporidium spp. nPCR yielded a positive sample (i.e., Cryptosporidium sp. apodemus genotype I) from a Moroccan worm lizard, as well as for bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa in an Egyptian cobra, and Morganella morganii from a puff adder. Results from this study demonstrated the risk of zoonotic transmission of microorganisms and parasites present in blood and feces from reptiles that are brought to the souks in Marrakech, Morocco, to be sold for medicinal purposes or used for snake charming, being in direct and straight contact with humans.
   Author summaryThe world-famous Marrakech souks (markets) are a unique and scarcely studied context where reptiles are in constant contact with humans and used for traditional medicine or for the ancient craft of snake charming. Hence, we aimed to identify the pathogens present in blood and feces of reptiles kept in the markets of Marrakech to assess the zoonotic risk. Animals from vendors or snake charmers were sampled. DNA was extracted and molecularly screened to identify potentially zoonotic pathogens. Overall, 28.9% of reptiles were positive for at least one pathogen. Importantly, we detected Anaplasma spp. from four snakes, Rickettsia spp. from Mediterranean chameleons and puff adders, and Leishmania tarentolae from snakes and chameleons. On the other hand, zoonotic bacteria such Proteus vulgaris were identified from a Mediterranean chameleon, Pseudomonas aeruginosa from Egyptian cobra, and Morganella morganii from puff adder. Thus, reptiles that are kept in the souks of Marrakech may play a role in the zoonotic transmission of pathogens and parasites, given the constant contact with humans.

AB  - Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato and Rhipicephalus turanicus are very prevalent in Israel and are known to be vectors of human and animal diseases. The aim of this study was to identify the pathogens found in questing ticks and such parasitizing domestic and wild animals. Ticks were collected from 16 localities in Israel with the flagging technique and by examining dogs, hedgehogs, a badger and a tortoise. Bacterial and protozoal patho-gens were analyzed by PCR and sequencing. Overall, 374 R. sanguineus s.l. specimens were collected, out of which 142 by flagging and 132 from six dogs. Rickettsia africae, Rickettsia massiliae, Rickettsia conorii subsp. israelensis, and Anaplasma sp. were identified in ticks collected by flagging, Rickettsia aeschlimannii was found only in specimens collected from dogs, while Ehrlichia sp., Coxiella burnetii, Hepatozoon canis and Leishmania infantum were recorded in ticks collected by flagging and from dogs. Out of 226 specimens of R. turanicus, 124 were collected by flagging, while additional 33 from eight dogs, 64 from seven southern white-breasted hedgehogs (Erinaceus concolor), two from a European badger (Meles meles) and one from a Greek tortoise (Tes-tudo graeca). Out of 65 R. sanguineus s.l. pools 17 (26.2%) had pathogens, while seven of them were positive for one pathogen, and 10 for two pathogens. In 43 R. turanicus pools, R. aeschlimannii R. africae, Rickettsia barbariae, R. massiliae, Anaplasma sp., Ehrlichia sp. and C. burnetii, as well as Babesia microti, B. vogeli, Hepatozoon felis, and L. infantum was detected, while Listeria monocytogenes, Bartonella sp. and Toxoplasma gondii were negative in all R. sanguineus s.l. and R. turanicus pools examined. In conclusion, Babesia microti is reported for the first time in Israel, R. africae, R. aeschlimannii, C. burnetii and L. infantum are reported for the first time in R. sanguineus s.l. and R. turanicus, while H. felis is reported for the first time from R. turanicus in the country.

AB  - Tortoise shell is not only an armor, but also an important structure for storing nutrients for tortoise. The shell from one tortoise strain, Chinemys reevesii (CR), has long been used as a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Nowadays, massive CR shells are also processed into healthy food in Asian countries. Despite large-scale culture of CR in nowadays, there still exist massive counterfeit CR shells derived from other strains of tortoises in the market of TCM. However, it is usually difficult to identify the strain of shell only with the naked eyes, which leads to uncertainties for the healthcare efficacy. In this context, the present study aims to analyze both metabolites and inorganic elements contained in the shell from CR and two other common tortoise strains in the market, using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). We report that comprehensive metabolic and elemental differences have been revealed in the shell of three analyzed tortoise strains. Higher levels of various amino acids, fatty acids, and salutary trace elements and lower levels of lead and arsenic were found in CR shell, in comparison to the other two strains. These metabolic and elemental hallmarks found in CR shell are in accordance with its predominant healthcare effect described in TCM. A combination between leucine and lead was determined to be a potential marker to predict the strain of CR. The top discriminant metabolites and elements, as well as the combinational marker identifying the strain of CR in the training set, were further validated for their predictability by external test samples. Our study demonstrates that analyses of metabolites and inorganic elements contained in tortoise shell are useful to identify the strain of the tortoise.
