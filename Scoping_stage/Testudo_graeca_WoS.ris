AB  - Collection for the pet trade has been considered one of the major threats to the Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca, since it modulates the size and structure of the species' populations and, therefore, their demography. Maamora forest is one of the most suitable habitats for this species. The proximity of the forest to Rabat indicated the possibility of these tortoise populations being particularly sensitive to over-collecting. Population demography was studied in four populations, in protected and unprotected areas in Maamora forest. The results showed significant differences as regards population size and structure between protected and unprotected areas. They specifically highlighted: i) higher density (23-17 indiv.ha(-1)) balanced populations in the protected areas, in which young adults were predominant, ii) a higher body condition in the protected areas, especially the females, and iii) a low density (5.5 ind.ha(-1)) more unbalance population in the unprotected areas, in which older females and younger males were predominant. In addition, a survey carried out by interviewing local adults (n = 200) showed that most people owned tortoises (61%, n = 200), mainly juveniles (65%, n = 123). The respondents stated that their tortoises had been captured in the forest (68%, n = 123). Maamora forest is home to one of the highest density populations of Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoises documented to date, and its conservation is essential if this species is to be maintained. Our social survey suggested that one of the challenges is to change the social perception of the Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise as a pet and highlight its intrinsic ecological value.

AB  - The spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca L., 1758) is classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN. In this context, it is important to explore the factors affecting its populations to set up an effective conservation plan. The present study was carried out in seven localities of Morocco with the objective to determine the ticks parasitizing this tortoise and their prevalence in relation to host characteristics and environmental factors. We examined 392 free-living tortoises for the presence of ticks during the spring 2018. A total number of 2238 adult ticks (no immature tick detected) were collected and all identified as Hyalomma aegyptium. Infection with at least one tick was detected in 77.6% +/- 6.5 of the total tortoises. The infestation prevalence varied according to localities. Infestation intensity varied from 1.5 to 12, while tick abundance ranged from 0.65 to 12 ticks/tortoise. Male tortoises were more infested than females (P < 0.01) and the infestation was age-dependant. Our statistical result provides that the best model drivers tick parasitism was which included locality and age. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of the high intensity of H. aegyptium infestation on the tortoise's health status and to assess the potential transmission of zoonotic pathogens.

AB  - Human-mediated secondary contact of recently diverged taxa offers valuable opportunities for studying the evolutionary mechanisms involved in the establishment and maintenance of genetic boundaries between taxa. We used mitochondrial and microsatellite markers to examine a recently introduced population of the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) of mixed origin in the Donana National Park (SW Spain). The earliest records of tortoises in Donana trace back to the 18th century, but several population reinforcements in the 20th century with animals from Morocco are welldocumented. Consequently, different genetic lineages, which represent distinct subspecies, are thought to co-exist there. Our results confirmed the presence of distinct lineages by revealing that tortoises of the subspecies T. g. marokkensis were introduced into a local allochthonous T. g. graeca population. Unexpectedly, T. g. marokkensis haplotypes exclusively appeared in males, and admixture levels were statistically sex-biased toward males. The sex ratio of the population deviated from parity, with males being 2.36-fold more abundant than females. Our results indicated that population reinforcements had a strong effect on the genetic composition of this population and aggravated its sex ratio deviation. We predict that this sex-biased pattern of introgression is ephemeral and advocated to the near loss of T. g. marokkensis haplotypes.

AB  - Demography and population biology aspects of the Moorish tortoise, Testudo graeca graeca were studied in the Pare National d'El Kala, north-eastern Algeria. Density, which was assessed by capture-mark-recapture procedures in a study plot of 30 ha surface, was 3.73 individuals x ha(-1). Adult sex-ratio was nearly equal (1.06:1). Sexual maturity was reached at 7-8 years of age in the males and at 9-11 years in the females. The mean age of tortoises was 13.8 +/- 6.4 years (n = 88). Maximum longevity was over 20 years in both sexes. The females reached larger body size than the males. The growth was rapid during the early years of age in both sexes, and tended to stop completely by the 9-12 years of life in the males and by the 8-10 years in the females. The instantaneous growth of adults which were recaptured in multiple years indicated an average growth rate of 11.34 mm/year in the males, and of 26.30 mm/year in the females. Mortality was estimated at 3.94%. The main mortality cause for the tortoises of this population was the occurrence of fires spreading throughout the study area. These data are of interest because demographic patterns of Testudo graeca seem to vary not only because of their relative genetical variability, but also because of their relative environmental stress.

TI  - First records of Hyalomma aegyptium (Acari : Ixodida : Ixodidae) from the Russian spur-thighed tortoise, Testudo graeca nikolskii, with an analysis of tick population dynamics
T2  - JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - During the fall of 1995 and the spring of 1996, 77 statistically comparable tick collections, comprising 792 specimens, were made from adults of the Russian spur-thighed tortoise, Testudo graeca nikolskii, at 4 sites along Russia's Black Sea coast. These are the first tick collections reported from T. g. nikolskii since its recognition as a taxonomic entity. All ticks were determined to be Hyalomma (Hyalomma) aegyptium, a common tortoise parasite in southern Russia that in 1930 was erroneously designated the type of subgenus Hyalommasta. Male ticks were recovered from more tortoises (67) than were females (57) or immatures (14), and nymphs were seen only in the fall. Significantly more ticks parasitized male tortoises than females, perhaps because males of T. g. nikolskii have larger home ranges. However, no functional relationship was found between tortoise ventral surface area and degree of tick infestation. Like other tortoise ticks, H. aegyptium is expected to decline in concert with its increasingly threatened hosts.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the main drivers threatening biodiversity. Together with the direct effects of exurban sprawl (e.g., habitat loss), the behavior of new residents may have important implications for species conservation. This manuscript addresses the effects of exurban sprawl on the collection and captivity of the endangered spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) in southeastern Spain. In June 2004, we undertook 362 structured interviews with exurban residents. Our results showed that most of the 12% of new residents who keeps tortoises in captivity have collected them from the wild (51%). Reintroductions and captive breeding were also frequent practices (24% and 26%, respectively). These practices, which are expected to increase in forthcoming years, might have important implications for the conservation of the species (local extinction, disease spread, or genetic mixing). Paradoxically, new residents collect tortoises to "protect'' wild individuals from natural and anthropic threats. Therefore, even though many new residents are concerned about the spur-thighed tortoise, they do not practice sound conservation measures. This study highlights the importance of incorporating human dimensions for wildlife into planning for urban sprawl. (C) 2012 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - We studied growth of 284 live Moorish tortoises (Testudo graeca graeca) from the central Jbilet Mountains, the Admine Forest, and near Essaouira in westcentral Morocco in 2001. Size structures, but not age structures, differed significantly among populations. No very old tortoises were found at any site. Most populations of tortoises suffered over-collecting for the tourist trade in the past, and some collecting still continues, which probably explains the lack of older tortoises. Of tortoises remaining in the populations we studied, both males and females grew relatively quickly for 10-12 yr in all three populations, after which their growth rates deceased markedly. Females in all three populations had greater asymptotic sizes than males, and CL and log mass differed significantly between sexes by age 9 yr for the three populations, except for log mass of tortoises from Essaouira, which differed by age 6. Mean CLs and log masses were significantly greater in Admine and Essaouira tortoises than in tortoises from Jbilet. Estimated mean age at maturity varied from 5.8 to 7.6 yr for males and 7.7-10.5 yr for females. Although past over-collecting of tortoises has probably depressed population abundances and eliminated the larger, older tortoises at all three sites, the current differences in population structure and growth pattern may be the result of geographic variation in environmental conditions, suggesting different selective mechanisms for the three populations.

AB  - Identifying key evolutionary strategies that support population persistence remains a challenging task for biodiversity conservation. Here we assess if animal adaptations to cope with low densities (i.e. that facilitate mate-findings or promote spatial aggregation of individuals) can allow species to persist in human-altered habitats. A spatially explicit and individual-based model was developed to assess if, and under what circumstances, such adaptations maintain population viability. The model was parameterised with data from the movement and demography of the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) and simulated scenarios with differences in adult survivorships, initial population Sizes and habitat alterations. Habitat alterations reduced population viability, and extinction rates were dependent on population characteristics and mate-finding distance. In contrast, philopatry around the birthplace did not prevent extinctions. Our results highlight the importance of considering specific spatial traits of species when assessing their vulnerability to human habitat alterations.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry has been proposed as a useful noninvasive tool for detecting the influence of the environment on body development. In the present study, we used digital images to estimate the fluctuating asymmetry of the plastron in an isolated Testudo graeca population in Dobrogea, Romania. We extracted data from the photos regarding the area, height, and width of 3 plastron scutes. A total of 155 adult tortoises analysed showed reduced variation in plastron asymmetry and no significant relationship was detected between fluctuating asymmetry and sex or body size. We suggest that fluctuating asymmetry may be an individual trait, with no predictive value at the population level.

AB  - The spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca has a wide distribution encompassing southern Europe and the Middle East through to northern Africa. The populations at the northern limit of T. graeca's range in the province of Dobrogea (Romania) are sparsely distributed across the entire area, with higher densities found in the hilly forested areas. Although strictly protected, the spur-thighed tortoise was and continues to be impacted by human activities. This study investigated the presence and characteristics of scars from past injuries on their shells. We studied three populations from protected areas, situated along a north-south gradient of approximately 150 km: Macin Mountains National Park (northernmost limit of T. graeca's range), Cetatea Histria, located within the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve, in the central part of the region, and the Dumbraveni Forest Natural Reserve in the south. All three populations had individuals with scars from past injuries on their shells. The highest numbers of injured tortoises were in Dumbraveni Forest (35.78%) and Macin Mountains (35%) while the population from Cetatea Histria (11.26%) was less affected. Carapace injury frequency was higher in the Macin Mountains whilst the Dumbraveni Forest population had a higher frequency of plastron injuries. Human-caused injuries were observed mainly in the anterior and dorsal zones of the carapace and the anterior zone of the plastron. Natural injuries were located on the posterior zone of the carapace, mainly on marginal scutes. Our study showed that the scars of turtle shells proved to be an excellent depository of past and recent human impacts and may offer insights for better conservation and management strategies.

AB  - The Spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, with small and fragmented populations located around the Mediterranean basin. In Turkey, this species has remained poorly studied which hampers solid assessment of threats and conservation measures. We studied the spatial distribution, habitat use, and demography of the species in the Gediz Delta (Aegean coast of Turkey) between 2015 and 2017 with a specific capture-mark-recapture survey made in the Sazligol marshes. A total of 114 individuals (20 juveniles, 62 males and 32 females) were captured and released in that period. Carapace length of adult females was on average higher (205.2 +/- 3.2 mm) than in adult males (190.9 +/- 2.3 mm). Sex ratio was biased with 1.94 males per female. Based on the capture-recapture histories of 65 individuals (3 juveniles, 37 males and 25 females) marked in 2015, we estimated the population size of the Sazligol marsh population to be 137 +/- 23 individuals, which corresponds to a density of 5.7 individuals per ha. The main threats detected were agricultural activities, urbanisation and captures for the pet trade.

AB  - Wild populations of many species are declining as a result of habitat destruction and climate change but also through the over-collection for wild meat and the pet trade. With a long history of trade around the Mediterranean, populations of the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca graeca) have become highly disturbed. In this study we utilise a molecular approach to investigate the diversity, population admixture and structure of T. g. graeca populations in northern Africa and southern Spain, as well as to obtain an insight into the origin of newly established populations in the south of Europe. We infer this from the sequencing of two partial regions of the mitochondria (12s rRNA + cyt b) and genotyping at 16 microsatellite markers in 448 tortoises. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that Spanish populations were founded from North Africa, the consequence of multiple introductions or exchanges in genetic material as a result of trans-oceanic dispersal. Despite the trade of individuals between both sides of the Gibraltar Strait, our analysis of population structure showed clear differences between both the African and European populations, suggesting an incipient evolutionary lineage in southeast of Spain. As such, these populations possess unique genetic identities and should be treated as different management units. Surprisingly, the genetic data identified a great deal of diversity contained within pet (captive) stock and also allowed us to infer hybrids among individuals with another species of terrestrial tortoise from northern Spain (T. hermanni hermanni). Additionally, our results provide insight into the local movement and trade of individuals that has occurred around the Mediterranean basin (between northern Africa and southern Spain) and as such provides guidance for the effective management of T. g. graeca captive stock and the illegal trafficking.

AB  - In semi-arid areas of the Saharan Atlas region in Algeria, 33 tortoises (Testudo graeca) were examined for ticks in 2017-2018. All ticks found were adults and they were identified as Hyalomma aegyptium. For the total sample studied, the infestation prevalence was 63.6 %. The mean infestation intensity was 4.04 and the parasite abundance was 2.57. The infestation prevalence, the mean infestation intensity and the parasite abundance in female tortoises were higher than in males, but this variation was statistically insignificant. The number of ticks was positively and significantly correlated with tortoises' body measurements: body weight, straight carapace length, carapace height, mid-body carapace width and plastron length. The parasitism by female and male ticks separately was not statistically significant. A total of 40 % of ticks were found attached to the hind limbs, 37.7 % to the forelimbs, 10.6 % to the neck, 11.7% to the tail, and no individuals were detected on the carapace. Statistically, the forelimbs and the neck were the preferred attachment areas for H. aegyptium.

AB  - From March to April 2017, a total of 147 free-ranging spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) was captured in different habitat types of northern Tunisia and examined for tick infestation. A total of 134 was infested, yielding an infestation prevalence of 91.2%. From these tortoises, 1,174 ticks were collected, a subsample (10%, n=120) of which was randomly selected and identified; the remaining ticks were stored at -80 C and examined for zoonotic pathogens. Only adult Hyalomma aegyptium were found among the subsample of ticks collected for spur-thighed tortoise. The prevalence of tick infestation did not vary significantly within the study area but differences in intensity were observed in relation to the size of tortoises and the vegetation coverage. Our results provide strong evidence that adult H. aegyptium is the predominant tick species found on wild spur-thighed tortoises in northern Tunisia, where the species is commonly traded illegally across the Mediterranean Basin. Considering the potential transmission of several zoonotic pathogens by H. aegyptium to humans, we highlight the need to develop a surveillance system to prevent the introduction and the spread of tick-borne pathogens in the Mediterranean Basin.

AB  - Tortoises of the genus Testudo are commonly kept pets on the Maltese Islands. This is a first record of the presence of Hyalomma aegyptium (Linnaeus 1758), also known as the "tortoise tick," on Malta. Two male H. aegyptium were collected from an adult Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca Linnaeus 1758) and a further two male H. aegyptium were collected from an adult female Egyptian tortoise (Testudo kleinmanni Lortet 1883). These tortoises were believed to be illegally imported, wild-caught specimens from North Africa. The presence of H. aegyptium on Malta is of both biological and medical relevance since these ticks are known potential vectors for numerous zoonotic diseases. This is also believed to be the first record of T. kleinmanni as a host for H. aegyptium.

AB  - Fire is a key ecological process in several biomes worldwide. Over recent decades, human activities (e.g. rural abandonment, monoculture plantations) and global warming are magnifying the risk of fire, with changes in fire intensity and frequency. Here, we offer the first study that examines the impact of fire on the spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca living in a native cork oak forest and pine plantation in north-western Africa. A total of 44 transects (22 burnt and 22 unburnt) were sampled at 8 sites affected by fires of natural cork oak forest and pine plantation with 8 surveys per site in 2015-2017 (264 hours of sampling effort). Tortoise densities were estimated with line-transect distance sampling. The detection probability of tortoises was higher in burnt (0.915) than unburnt (0.474) transects. The density of tortoises was negatively associated with elevation and declined with fire by c. 50% in both forest types. The negative response of T. graeca to fire should be considered in conservation planning of this species in north-western Africa in a future scenario of changes in fire regime.

AB  - Macroparasites in general, and ectoparasites in particular, have the potential to regulate host population dynamics. In this context, this study addresses the tick parasitism traits of the Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) in the core area of its distribution range (northwestern Morocco, Maamora). It was discovered that 92.5% of the tortoises were parasitized by ticks in spring, with an infestation intensity and an abundance of 6.7 and 6.2 tick/tortoise, respectively. The observed parasitization rates were among the highest reported worldwide for T. graeca, which could relate to density-depended effects driving host-parasite interactions. The main tick species that parasitized the tortoises were Hyalomma aegyptium (95.6% of the ticks and in the 100% of the parasitized tortoises), Hy. marginatum, Hy. excavatum and Hy. scupense. Individual predictors for the tortoises, such as age, sex and the interaction between body condition and sex, were significantly related to tick abundance. Age-related behavioural differences might favour a higher host-tick effective contact in adults than in juveniles. The fact that males are more active in spring - the breeding season - might explain the observed male-bias in tick abundance and may also be responsible for the negative effect of male body condition on tick infestation rate in contrast to females. Given the potential role played by parasites as regards modulating population dynamics, our results suggest that ticks should be taken into account in the conservation and management programmes of this tortoise species.

AB  - Population fluctuations are driven by a combination of multiple factors, which can be classified into endogenous and exogenous. Endogenous factors are directly related to density-dependent forces, whereas exogenous factors are environmental drivers (e.g. climate). Several studies have reported the effects of endogenous and exogenous factors using exponential population models in mammals, birds or insects, but few works have explored the effects on reptiles, specifically in tortoises. In this study, we developed logistic population growth models to decipher the role of these factors on the population dynamics of the spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca. The role of environmental drivers in the distribution, movement, survival, reproduction or individual growth has been described for this species in previous works, but no studies have examined the effects of both endogenous and exogenous factors in population growth rates. Using long-term data of T. graeca in southeastern Iberian Peninsula (1999-2013), we fitted non-linear logistic models with endogenous and exogenous effects. The results showed that endogenous processes are important drivers of the population dynamics of this species, and that exogenous factors, such as freezing hours in winter, also directly affect the population growth rate. Intolerance of extreme winter temperatures may especially affect hatchlings and juvenile tortoises. Our models also showed that perturbations (i.e. a fire occurred during the monitoring period) have a lasting impact by reducing the carrying capacity of the population. This study shows that simple quantitative approaches based on population dynamic theory are useful for deciphering the ecological mechanisms underlying dynamics of tortoise populations.

AB  - A reduction in adult survival in long-living species may compromise population growth rates. The spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) is a long-lived reptile that is threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation. Golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), whose breeding habitats overlap that of tortoises, may predate them by dropping them onto rocks and breaking their carapaces. In SE Spain, the number of golden eagles has increased in the last decades and the abundance of their main prey (i.e., rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus) has decreased. Our aims were to 1) describe the role of tortoises in golden eagles' diet, and 2) estimate the predation impact of golden eagles on tortoises in eagles' territories and in the regional tortoise population. We collected regurgitated pellets and prey remains under eagle nests and roosts, and obtained information on tortoise abundance and population structure and rabbit abundance. We found that tortoises were an alternative prey to rabbits, so that eagles shifted to the former where the latter were scarce. The average predation rate on tortoises was very low at the two studied scales. However, eagles showed a marked selection for adult female tortoises, which led the tortoise sex ratio to be biased towards males in those eagle territories with higher tortoise predation. Whether this may compromise the spur-thighed tortoise long-term population viability locally deserves further attention.

AB  - The diet of an Algerian population of spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) was studied with the aims of exploring: (i) the variation in diet among males, females and juveniles, (ii) the relationships between consumption and relative availability of the plant species, and (iii) which plant tissues, vegetative or reproductive, are eaten by tortoises. We recorded more than forty plant species at the study area, with monocot species (n = 7) having a greater percent cover than that of dicot species (n = 31 species) or Gymnospermae (n = 2). Tortoise diet was studied by categorising 4422 plant and animal fragments in faecal pellets of 20 males, 16 females and eight juveniles. Tortoises ate a wide variety of plant species, including 13 dicots and three monocots, and occasionally invertebrates. The number of fragments for a plant species was correlated with plant species cover, and plant vegetative tissues exceeded plant reproductive tissues in the faeces. Dicots (Fabaceae, Composeae, Primulaceae, and Caryophyllaceae) accounted for over 70% of the diet (faecal fragments). The high dietary (niche) overlap, and null model analysis (RA3 algorithm with 30,000 Monte Carlo simulations), indicate that males, females and juveniles did not partition fund resources; all three groups ate the same plant species.

AB  - Aim Recent biogeographical studies have postulated a North African, Late Pleistocene, origin for some species of the Iberian Peninsula. However, a robust assessment of such range expansions requires high-resolution molecular tools to resolve overlapping biogeographical and cultural processes. Here we aim to determine whether the spur-thighed tortoise, Testudo graeca, arrived in south-eastern Spain during historical or prehistoric times, and whether its dispersal to the Iberian Peninsula was human-mediated. Location The western Mediterranean Basin (south-eastern Spain, northern Algeria and north-western Morocco). Methods Using 428 samples from 19 sites in North Africa and 18 in south-eastern Spain, we obtained mitochondrial sequences from the cytochrome b gene and genotypes derived from seven microsatellite loci. These data were employed to obtain population genetics descriptors, haplotype networks, Bayesian cluster analyses and isolation-by-distance patterns. Moreover, we used a Bayesian demographic approach to delimit the dates involved in the range expansion. Results We found lower levels of genetic variability and weak mitochondrial differentiation in the south-eastern Spanish tortoises compared with the North African ones. However, exclusive haplotypes occurred in the Iberian samples and microsatellite cluster analyses revealed moderate levels of admixture across both sides of the Mediterranean. A coastal area in the west of Algeria and the central-southern region in south-eastern Spain are suggested as the most probable founder and arrival places, respectively. Finally, we identified signatures of an ancient bottleneck event approximately 20,00030,000 years ago. Main conclusions The spur-thighed tortoise probably arrived in south-eastern Spain during Late Pleistocene sea-level low stands. The role that humans may have played as dispersers across the Mediterranean remains unclear. Our results are in accordance with other recent findings of trans-Mediterranean expansions during this period and highlight the importance of employing precise methodological approaches before a species can be considered as historically introduced.

AB  - Fires strongly influence the ecology of reptiles and have both direct and indirect effects on population dynamics as they affect life history traits. Here, we examine the effects of fire on individual growth patterns and on the survival rates of a tortoise Testudo graeca population in south-eastern Spain. We compare the biometric data from recaptures 4 years before and after a fire which burned 31 % of our study area. The von Bertalanffy and Gompertz growth models best describe the individual growth patterns for males and females. In males, but not females, fire significantly decreased the time required to reach their asymptotic size (k parameter). However, adult survival analyses reveal that the local survival rates lowered for both sexes after fire. Our work evidences that the effects of fire can be complex and maintained over time, affecting different life history traits.

AB  - Simple Summary The trading and collection of wildlife for pets is one of the main threats for the conservation of some species worldwide. Assessing the human dimension of it is essential to improve our understanding of its drivers, which may help inform the design of effective species conservation strategies. We address this issue using the Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) as a case study. This species has sharply declined in its native range, tortoise trade and non-commercial collection for pets being some of the main threats. In fact, both uses have been documented in southern Europe and northern Africa, although this species has been protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) since 1975. Our study, which was based on a questionnaire survey, (i) demonstrated that many people in Rabat city (Morocco) and surroundings keep tortoises as pets (55%; n = 480), most of which had been collected directly from wild populations, and (ii) highlighted the limited ecological and biological knowledge of tortoise owners (mainly of those living in the city of Rabat) on the species. Our findings evidence how both the sociological context and the role of consumers/harvesters play a major part in this problem with international projection. We discussed deeply how tortoise non-commercial collection might affect its conservation and welfare, and recommended appropriate actions that focus on strengthening collection bans. The trading and collection of wild animals as pets may be cause for concern regarding animal welfare and species conservation. These concerns can be exemplified by Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca), a long-living species whose use as pets is long established. The human dimension plays a major role in the wildlife for the pet collection, and is particularly important in countries like Morocco, where this might pose a threat to the conservation of the species involved. This study, which is based on a questionnaire survey (n = 480 participants), documents the fact that many people in Morocco keep tortoises as pets: 55% of the participants in the survey and over two tortoises/person. Importantly, most captive tortoises, particularly juveniles, had been collected directly from wild populations by their owners (42%, n = 264). In general, the tortoise owners had limited knowledge of their tortoises' habits and requirements, although rural people were more likely to acknowledge that the tortoise is a wild and threatened species. Our study reveals that non-commercial collection is a common activity in Morocco that may threaten wild tortoise populations and hence species conservation, and it could have consequences regarding the welfare of the animals. We were also able to identify the profile of people towards whom education campaigns should be directed in order to reduce the number of tortoises collected from wild populations. Additional field research should also be conducted to quantify the impact of pet collection on wild tortoise populations.

AB  - Much of our current knowledge about the genetic dynamics in range expansions originates from models, simulations and microcosm experiments that need to be corroborated by field data. Here, we report a neutral genetic pattern that matches the predictions of the genetic surfing theory. Genetic surfing occurs when repeated founding events and genetic drift act on the wave of advance of an expanding population, promoting strong spatial structure. In the range expansion of the tortoise Testudo graeca from North Africa to southeastern Spain, we found several genetic signatures consistent with surfing: a decrease of genetic diversity with distance from the initial founder area, clinal patterns in allele frequencies, rare African alleles which have become common at distal sites in the Spanish range, and stronger spatial differentiation in the expanded range than in the original one. Our results provide support for the theory that genetic drift can be an important force in shaping the genetic structure of expanding populations.

AB  - Human behavior is an important factor in understanding the impact of exurban sprawl (i.e. low-density rural home development) on native species. We studied the long-term effect of pet collection on populations of the threatened spur-thighed tortoise by residents of exurban areas in southeastern Spain. We built a system dynamic model using authors' own data and bibliographic data about tortoise population dynamics, the housing development dynamics, and the behavior of local residents toward this species. The model includes two submodels (spur-thighed population dynamics and households dynamics) interconnected through a tortoise collection submodel. Simulations showed that exurban intensity (i.e. size of a housing development) is essential in determining the intensity and speed of tortoise population decrease. Populations may become extinct due to collection in areas around medium to large housing developments (above 650 houses). Low housing development causes a considerable reduction of original population levels (more than 14%). Environmental education program by itself, with the aim of reducing the willingness of new residents to keep tortoises in captivity, does not seem very effective. The quality and the speed with which the educational program is initialized are key factors in determining the effectiveness of the educational program. The scenarios simulation results suggest that the integration of policies of strong development constraints and educational programs are the most effective way in reducing the impact of exurban development on tortoise populations.

AB  - Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) is actually included in the IUCN as vulnerable species. Its main European population is located in southeastern Spain. Although a great deal of information has been acquired on the internal medicine and survey and even parasitological fauna on these animals, there are no references about contaminants levels in this species. The objectives of this study were to compare the levels of two metals (cadmium and lead) in the blood of spur-thighed tortoises from two different populations, one from Southeastern of Spain (n = 22) and the other from North of Africa (n = 39), kept in captivity at the Santa Faz Recuperation Centre (Alicante, Spain) and to investigate the relationship between their blood levels of lead and their blood delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (delta-ALAD) activity. Blood lead and cadmium concentrations were higher in tortoises from African than in those from Spain. Moreover, a negative and significant correlation (P < 0.05) was found between delta-ALAD activity and blood lead levels, indicating the suitability of this enzyme as biomarker for lead in this species.

AB  - A reliable estimation of individuals' age is helpful to conduct demographic studies on wildlife populations. In tortoises, many studies have estimated individuals' age by counting growth rings on their scutes, assuming one ring per year (1:1 ratio). However, the accuracy of this method is controversial. The ring deposition pattern can vary depending on species, or even populations, and should be studied comprehensively. We studied the ring deposition pattern of Testudo graeca in southeastern Iberian Peninsula, using recaptures of 156 individuals between 2004 and 2010. We used a novel approach to explore the ring deposition pattern and to test possible differences between localities and individuals. Our results revealed that most analysed individuals (57.4%) showed a 1:1 ratio, in which rings were deposited during months of activity (spring to autumn). However, we found a trend to count less rings than years, which underestimated 1 year every 3 or 4 years. No differences in the deposition patterns were found among sites, sizes or sexes because the halt in growth during hibernation equally affects all tortoises in all sites. Our results support that the assumed 1:1 ratio in the assignment of individuals' age is too simplistic. Since ring deposition patterns are complex, the use of statistical approaches capable of handling deviations from the assumed deposition ratios can help to better depict population age structures.

AB  - The predation of young tortoise is considered a major cause of mortality for many tortoise species. The predation by common ravens has been identified as being responsible for significant decreases in tortoise populations. Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise hatchlings and juveniles in Maamora forest (Morocco) were studied in order to describe the size/age class predation of common ravens on young tortoises and infer the drivers of predation risk and population abundance. The results showed a high level of predation on young tortoises (<75mm carapace length) attributed to ravens in areas with low vegetation cover, representing 100% of the cases of mortality (n=147), but it was moderate in covered areas (n=19), representing 12-27%. The population structure of living juveniles differed significantly between covered and uncovered areas, thus suggesting that raven predation might modify juvenile population structure. Finally, N-mixture models showed a positive relationship between (i) bare cover and tortoise detectability that is only evidenced when the plot is far from a perch and (ii) population abundance and shrub species-richness, being higher in uncovered areas. Our results improve the knowledge on predation and survival on this critical stage in life, which is crucial for the conservation of the Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise.

AB  - Studying phylogeographic histories in wide-ranging species provides key insights into those processes shaping current species' distributions and genetic structuring. In this work, we extend previous sampling and analyse data from three mitochondrial genes to explore in-depth the phylogeography of the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca), the most widely distributed of Western Palearctic tortoise species. The combination of loci with different evolutionary rates and new fossil data in molecular clock analyses allow us to infer a dual diversification burst of the species, which took place since the Mio-Pliocene for the eastern subspecies and during the Pleistocene for the subspecies distributed in North Africa. The latter seems to correspond to a more or less contemporary diversification burst, which resulted in the current west-east allopatric/parapatric distribution of the North African lineages. In addition to the previously known genetic lineages, a new one was discovered in Libya. Within a more recent framework, we use estimates of genetic diversity and demographic inferences from molecular data to address the origin of three extant Western European populations. The comparison of their current genetic signatures supports the recent introduction of T. graeca into Majorca and Sardinia and an ancient origin of the populations in south-eastern Spain. The fossil history of T. graeca supports our findings from the most comprehensive and unifying phylogeographic study conducted to date for T. graeca. Our work highlights T. graeca as a paradigmatic system for studying phylogeographic processes that act in very different temporal and geographical contexts.

AB  - The spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca ibera Pallas, 1814 is a good example of a vulnerable long-lived CITES species, which is widely bred as a pet and can be easily reproduced in captivity. However, the high number of bred tortoises makes it difficult to monitor the international pet trade. Despite microchipping being widely recommended as an identification method, it is unsuitable for hatchlings and young tortoises because implanting the chip in chelonians can sometimes cause health problems. We believe that these disadvantages can be resolved by plastron photo documentation but this method is still not considered a valid alternative. The objective of this study was to find a method for identifying a specimen from a photograph database using morphometrics, an approach potentially more reliable than other fingerprinting methods currently used for tortoises. We propose a combined dissimilarity measure calculated from the relative differences in seam distances between two plastron photographs. The reliability of identification is studied on a dataset of 90 spur-thighed tortoises, 20 of which were photographed at ages two, eight, 14 and 20 months. We achieved a reliability of 99.3-99.9% in identifying time-lagged photographs of the same individual against photographs of unrelated individuals, and 97.5-99.8% in identifying time-lagged photographs against photographs of siblings. We conclude that a properly taken plastron photograph of Testudo graeca enables precise identification during the first years of ontogenetic development.

AB  - The spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) is an endangered Mediterranean tortoise that lives in North Africa, Southern Europe and Southwest Asia. In the wake of recent legislation making their keeping as domestic animals illegal, many of these animals have been returned to wildlife recovery centers in Spain. In the present study, a population of such tortoises showing signs of ocular disease and nasal discharge was examined for the presence of Chlamydia spp. Cloacal, conjunctival and/or choanal swabs were collected from 58 animals. Using a real-time PCR specific for the family Chlamydiaceae, 57/58 animals tested positive in at least one sample. While only a few samples proved positive for C. pecorum, sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed a sequence identical to previously published sequences from specimens of German and Polish tortoises. Whole-genome sequences obtained from two conjunctival swab samples, as well as ANIb, TETRA values and a scheme based on 9 taxonomic marker genes revealed that the strain present in the Spanish tortoises represented a new yet non-classified species, with C. pecorum being its closest relative. We propose to designate the new species Candidatus Chlamydia testudinis. (C) 2020 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - An epidemic of chronic rhinitis in a population of 50 captive spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca graeca) from Palafrugell (Girona, Spain) is described, in which eight animals died and 12 were euthanatized to perform necropsies and post-mortem studies. The main clinical sign was a bilateral, seromucous rhinitis often accompanied by stomatitis and glossitis. Hematology and serum biochemistry were performed in 33 of the 50 ill animals and in 29 healthy tortoises from three disease-free populations. Lymphocyte count, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity, and alpha-globulin levels were significantly higher in the animals from the sick population. The heterophil count was significantly lower in the sick animals. Some of the diseased tortoises also showed a normocytic-normochromic anemia. Lesions were restricted to the respiratory system and oral cavity. Marked epithelial hyperplasia and presence of a severe mixed inflammatory infiltrate in the epithelium of the oral, nasal, and tracheal mucosae were observed. Electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of intracytoplasmic and intranuclear viral particles of the size, shape, and distribution pattern typical of a herpesvirus.

AB  - Using mtDNA sequences and 12 microsatellite loci, we compare populations of Testudo graeca from Sardinia and North Africa. The observed pattern of almost no differentiation combined with reduced variation in the Sardinian population is consistent with introduction in prehistoric or historic times from what is now Tunisia and neighbouring Algeria. Furthermore, in the light of the recently published recommendation to eradicate the non-native T. graeca from Italy, we review recent studies on the archaeological and fossil record, on the phylogeography and population genetics of the three other chelonian species occurring in Sardinia (Emys orbicularis, T. hermanni, T. marginata). We conclude that the extant Sardinian populations of all four species are not native. However, they are and should be safeguarded under EC law (Council Regulation No 338/97 on the Protection of Species of Wild Fauna and Flora; Flora Fauna Habitat Directive: Appendix IV, Art. 12) because they serve as a back-up for the declining mainland populations. Moreover, these populations constitute an important part of the human-shaped natural heritage of the Mediterranean.

AB  - Tortoise ticks, Hyalomma aegyptium , are considered so strongly associated with their hosts that they are even used as indirect indicators for them. In such a case, a robust pattern of congruence between host and parasite could be expected, with phylogeographic breaks within the host being reflected in their parasites. We sequenced two mitochondrial partial gene regions (12S rRNA and Cytochrome Oxidase 1) from ticks across northern Africa and Anatolia, and compared patterns of variation with those identified in its main host, Testudo graeca. Two distinct haplogroups were identified, both of which were found distributed across much of northern Africa. This pattern does not reflect the known variation within the host, which has multiple, geographically disjunct subspecies in this region, but rather the major climatic zones. This relationship can be explained by adaptive processes to environmental conditions influenced by the climate, as well as by the spatial structure of the communities of tick potential hosts in larval and nymphal stages. Extensive anthropogenic movement of tortoises may also obscure congruence patterns between H. aegyptium ticks and their hosts.

AB  - Although the spur-thighed tortoise, Testudo graeca, is one of the most widely distributed species of tortoises, its natural populations are threatened through its whole range. Particularly at south-eastern Spain, the species is mainly threatened by habitat destruction and over-collection, given that this chelonian has been traditionally considered an appreciate pet. As south-eastern Spanish wildlife recovery centers shelter hundreds of captive animals mainly coming from illegal trade or captive-bred, there is a strong debate about what to do with these animals: maintaining them in captivity all along their lives or reintroducing them to wildlife. It is well known that the reintroduction of captive animals supposes a risk for the wild population due to the uncertainty of their genetic origin and to the possible spread of infectious diseases. However, despite the increasing evidence that infectious agents are a potential health hazard for wildlife, little is known about the risk that introduced parasites could suppose for the wild populations of spur-thighed tortoise.
   The present study investigates for the first time the presence of helminth eggs and worms in faeces from 107 wild and captive individuals collected from mid-March to mid-June 2010, and relates the findings to different environmental and host variables. Sixteen oxyurid species and the ascarid Angusticaecum holopterum were identified. This last nematode and the oxyurid species Tachygonetria palearticus and T. seurati had not been reported in Spanish wild T. graeca previously. The prevalence of oxyurid eggs and worms were 94% and 70%, respectively; while, ascarid eggs and worms were found in 26% and 5% of tortoises, respectively. Ascarid infections affected mostly captive animals and were associated to caparace deformities and symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease (p < 0.05). Oxyurid infections were not associated to negative health traits and prevalence increased with age. In free-living tortoises, the distribution of pharingodonid genera also varied according to habitat; moreover, T. longicollis, T. pusilla, conica, T. robusta and Mehdiella stylosa where significantly more frequent in wild compared to captive tortoises (p < 0.05). Study results highlight important differences in the nematode fauna of captive and free-living tortoises and questions one more time if the reintroductions of captive animals suppose a risk for the wild population since the former ones can harbor and distribute among free populations pathogens like ascarid nematodes.

AB  - We assessed the dynamics of a population of spur-thighed tortoises, Testudo graeca, placed under long-term protection from human interference, We estimated demographic parameters and constructed vertical life tables based on age structures for two different study periods separated by a 12-yr interval. Average age at maturity was 6.9 yr for males and 8.5 yr for females. Clutch size varied with female size, but tended to be constant among years. Average annual female fecundity over 9 yr was 8.4 eggs and decreased significantly in years of high rainfall. Females seemed to reproduce yearly, but with a constantly low output, probably maximising both their long-term reproductive potential and the probability of producing offspring during favourable years for hatchling survival. Adult survival was high and constant between periods. Juvenile survivorship from egg to 6 yr and recruitment into the 5-8-yr-old cohorts were significantly higher in the second period. Life tables indicated a predominantly negative demographic trend for the first period, with an average population increase rate of 0.977, and an overall positive tendency for the second period, with an average increase rate of 1.091. These figures suggest that the population experienced a variation that was closer to the maximum estimates for the first period. mediated mainly by an increase in juvenile recruitment. The data indicate that, besides high adult survival rates, occasional high juvenile recruitment bouts may have an important regulatory effect on the population dynamics of Testudo graeca.

AB  - The spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) is a terrestrial species in which multiple mating is frequently observed. We assessed the probability of multiple paternity in clutches (n = 15) laid by eight females, including successive clutches. Paternity was determined by microsatellite analyses at three loci. A large number of alleles per locus (n = 15-22) provided high probabilities of detecting multiple paternity, particularly at all loci combined (P = 0.989). Multiple paternity was found in 20% of the clutches in which offspring displayed more than two paternal alletes. However, this frequency may have been underestimated, given the small clutch sizes and the few loci used. Also, T graeca is able to store sperm from single or multiple matings and can use it to fertilize subsequent clutches of eggs, as indicated by the fact that the second clutch of a captive female was sired by a different male and that clutches of another female were multiply sired by the same males. These results confirm that multiple paternity exists in T graeca and that sperm storage in this species may be an important reproductive strategy to fertilize multiple clutches per year.

AB  - The study of the movement of individuals directly informs about home-range sizes, migratory routes or habitat selection. But also, integrating movement into ecological models allows for larger-scale studies. Here we summarize the results of our line of research based in the individual-based model STEPLAND. The model was parameterized with movement, demographic and genetic data of spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) in SE Spain. We developed different simulation experiments to answer questions about the effects of global change on the conservation of this species. At the species level, we identified those evolutionary traits of tortoises, such as female sperm storage, that prevent extinctions in human-altered habitats. At landscape scale, we assessed the impact of agricultural abandonment and agricultural intensification on the population dynamics of this long-lived species. Only agricultural intensification negatively affected reproductive rates, population density, and probability of extinction of T. graeca, with time-lag responses of 20, 30 and 130 years respectively. Finally, in a regional context, we aim to simulate the early stages of a range expansion. Preliminary results reveal patterns compatible to "genetic surfing", a process affecting the expansion of low dispersal species impacted by strong ge-netic drift. We believe that our line of research exemplifies well that the scientific value of movement data goes well beyond the individual level.

AB  - The range dynamics of species distributed in temperate zones was significantly influenced by climatic fluctuations during the Pleistocene. However, little is known on how glacial and interglacial cycles affected the distribution of species occupying lower latitudes. The aim of this study was to assess Quaternary range dynamics of the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) in Iran and Transcaucasia and to infer how range fluctuations influenced the species' genetic diversity. We analysed mitochondrial DNA variation of samples from Iran and Transcaucasia and reconstructed the species' palaeogeography by projecting species distribution models (SDMs) onto palaeoclimatic conditions of the mid-Holocene (6000 BP) and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21 000 BP). We found three mitochondrial lineages in Iran, corresponding to the subspecies T. g. armeniaca, T. g. buxtoni and T. g. zarudnyi, whose current distribution is limited predominately by precipitation. A combination of SDMs and demographic analyses revealed that the ranges of these subspecies experienced only a slight shift during the Quaternary and did not expand significantly after the LGM. These results for T. graeca indicate that range dynamics of ectothermic taxa occupying lower latitudes in the western Palaearctic might be more complex and may not follow a simplistic scenario of glacial retraction and postglacial expansion.

AB  - The dissemination of vector arthropods harbouring zoonotic pathogens through the uncontrolled transboundary trade of exotic and pet animals poses an important threat to Public Health. In the present report, we describe the introduction of pathogenic Rickettsia africae and R. aeschlimanni in ticks removed from imported tortoises in Qatar. A total of 21 ticks were collected from pet spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) from Doha, May 2018, and studied for species identification and characterization of Rickettsia spp. Morphological and molecular analysis of ticks allowed their identification as Hyalomma aegyptium. Molecular analysis of partial ompA and gltA genes showed that Rickettsia sequences found on these ticks clustered with sequences classified as R. aeschilimanii and R. africae. Since pre-adult stages of H. aegyptium also feed on humans, this tick species may play a role in the transmission of R. aeschilimanii and R. africae. We alert for the introduction of non-native pets as vehicles for tick importation, known vectors for animal and human pathogenic agents. Importation of exotic species into non-autochthonous countries deserves strict control to enforce robust surveillance and mitigate potential exotic diseases epidemics.

AB  - The use of local ecological knowledge (LEK) has been advocated for biodiversity monitoring and management. To date, however, it has been underused in studying wild populations of animals and, particularly, in obtaining quantitative abundance estimates. We evaluated LEK as a tool for collecting extensive data on local animal abundance and population trends. We interviewed shepherds in southeastern Spain, asking them to estimate the local abundance of the terrestrial tortoise Testudo graeca. We quantified reliability of abundance estimates derived from interviews by comparing them with those obtained from standard field-sampling protocols (distance sampling). We also explored the complementarity of these 2 approaches. LEK provided high-quality and low-cost information about both distribution and abundance of T. graeca. Interviews with shepherds yielded abundance estimates in a much wider range than linear transects, which only detected the species in the upper two-thirds of its abundance range. Abundance estimates from both methodologies showed a close relationship. Analysis of confidence intervals indicated local knowledge could be used to estimate mean local abundances and to detect mean population trends. A cost analysis determined that the information derived from LEK was 100 times cheaper than that obtained through linear-transect surveys. Our results should further the use of LEK as a standard tool for sampling the quantitative abundance of a great variety of taxa, particularly when population densities are low and traditional sampling methods are expensive or difficult to implement.

AB  - Simple Summary
   A central goal of life history studies is documenting traits related to reproduction. In long-lived species, older individuals might have traits that enhance reproductive success. However, survivorship at young life stages is usually unknown, which blurs the basic understanding of how female traits influence recruitment and the relevance of climate variation. Our study, which was based on the spur-thighed tortoise, demonstrated that (i) maternal age and climatic conditions influence the recruitment, (ii) older females have greater offspring numbers, greater survival and smaller size and mass than younger females and (iii) severe climatic conditions-low rainfall and temperature-reduce the number of surviving offspring despite their increased size. We discuss deeply how the maternal age and climatic conditions might affect population dynamics of long-lived species and recommended long-term studies of reproductive parameters and appropriate conservation actions.
   Long-lived species are particularly interesting for investigation of trade-offs that shape reproductive allocation and the effective contribution to the next generations. Life history theory predicts that these species will buffer environmental stochasticity via changes in the reproductive investment, while maintaining high adult survival rates. The spur-thighed tortoise was selected as a case study in order to investigate the relationship between the linked maternal characteristics (size and age) and related traits in their hatchlings. We tracked naturally emerging hatchlings from young and old females under semi-natural conditions to test variations in hatchling numbers, body mass, size and survival over two years. We used linear mixed-effect models to analyze variations in hatchling body mass and size, and a mark-release-recapture framework to model their survival. Our study illustrates that old females of long-lived species have greater offspring numbers, greater survival and smaller size when compared with those of young females. The interannual variability evidenced the reduced offspring number and survival in the lower autumn rainfall and spring mean temperature year. Our results highlight the role of maternal age and climatic conditions in the population dynamics and the need for long-term studies of reproduction traits for designating adequate conservation strategies.

AB  - Mate searching is a key component of sexual reproduction that can have important implications for population viability, especially for the mate-finding Allee effect. Interannual sperm storage by females may be an adaptation that potentially attenuates mate limitation, but the demographic consequences of this functional trait have not been studied. Our goal is to assess the effect of female sperm storage durability on the strength of the mate-finding Allee effect and the viability of populations subject to low population density and habitat alteration. We used an individual-based simulation model that incorporates realistic representations of the demographic and spatial processes of our model species, the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca). This allowed for a detailed assessment of reproductive rates, population growth rates, and extinction probabilities. We also studied the relationship between the number of reproductive males and the reproductive rates for scenarios combining different levels of sperm storage durability, initial population density, and landscape alteration. Our results showed that simulated populations parameterized with the field-observed demographic rates collapsed for short sperm storage durability, but were viable for a durability of one year or longer. In contrast, the simulated populations with a low initial density were only viable in human-altered landscapes for sperm storage durability of 4 years. We find that sperm storage is an effective mechanism that can reduce the strength of the mate-finding Allee effect and contribute to the persistence of low-density populations. Our study highlights the key role of sperm storage in the dynamics of species with limited movement ability to facilitate reproduction in patchy landscapes or during population expansion. This study represents the first quantification of the effect of sperm storage durability on population dynamics in different landscapes and population scenarios.

AB  - Animal movement and behavior may respond to habitat modification or fragmentation in non trivial ways, thereby strongly conditioning the fate of populations. This study aims to understand movement patterns of non-dispersal animals in both natural and altered landscapes, using the endangered terrestrial tortoise Testudo graeca as example. We used individual-based simulation models representing competing hypotheses on tortoise movement. Model parameterization and selection was based on radiotracking data and an inverse approach that is able to deal with observation uncertainty, individual variability, and process stochasticity. We find that land use intensification had a strong impact on the movement and behavior of non-dispersing individuals of T. graeca. In natural landscapes, males and females showed a similar movement and behavior profile with a strong home behavior component, and little individual variability. However, in altered landscapes, movement and behavior greatly varied among individuals, particularly in females, and males and females showed different movement patterns. Females showed a wide range of movement patterns, from strong home behavior to an unbounded movement. Our study shows that population or movement models that assume single behavioral states for animals inhabiting different landscape structures can be strongly misleading and, furthermore, that the impact of landscape modification on movement and behavioral patterns can be strongly sex-biased. Flexible, individual-based movement models coupled with inverse parameterization and model selection approaches proved useful in understanding the mechanisms controlling animal movement patterns.

AB  - The Testudo graeca complex is a CITES-listed group of taxa (species or subspecies) that is under threat from over-harvesting for the Western pet and Asian food trade. Taxonomically, T graeca populations are in a state of flux. Middle Eastern T graeca in particular are very poorly known because of a lack of adequate sampling, especially in Iran. Two recent studies generated mitochondrial sequence data from Iran using non-overlapping mitochondrial (mt) markers from samples from localities with largely non-overlapping geographical distributions. By generating new sequence data from key Iranian specimens, this study allows for a more comprehensive appraisal of mt phylogeography. Using historic DNA methods, we provide mtDNA sequence data from a 19th century holotype (T. zarudnyi Nikolsky, 1896) along with new data from two recently collected topotypes of other putatively valid taxa (T. buxtoni Boulenger, 1921; Testudo perses Perala, 2002). The new data are used to assess the taxonomic assignments of previously published mtDNA sequences, reinforce the signal of considerable admixture among mt lineages in northwest Iran, establish a reference database for forensic studies of trade specimens and identify areas for future sampling.

AB  - Hyalomma aegyptium (Linnaeus, 1758) is a hard-tick species of the Ixodidae family with the main adult hosts being Palearctic tortoises of the genus Testudo. In Morocco, it is commonly found infecting Testudo graeca that has a wide geographic distribution and is subject to protection through international illegal trade legislation. This tortoise tick has been reported as an important vector of various human and animal pathogens. Unfortunately, to date, there are no strategies to control this hematophagous ectoparasite. The present study was conducted in laboratory to evaluate the acaricidal activity of essential oils (EOs) extracted from six plants of Moroccan origin as an alternative against H. aegyptium. All EOs tested displayed toxic effects on different life stages of H. aegyptium. Mentha suaveolens subsp. timija (LC50=0.910 mu L/mL and LC90=1.465 mu L/mL) and Satureja calamintha EOs (LC50=0.927 mu L/mL and LC90=1.347 mu L/mL) exhibited higher activity against hatching eggs, whereas Chenopodium ambrosioides EO was comparatively more toxic to larvae (LC50=0.444 mu L/mL and LC90=0.918 mu L/mL). Juniperus thurifera var. africana (LC50=0.0045mL/cm(2) and LC90=0.0118mL/cm(2)) and Lavandula pedunculata subsp. atlantica EOs (LC50=0.0036mL/cm(2) and LC90=0.0110mL/cm(2)) caused high mortality in nymphs. The effect of different EOs is discussed according to their chemical composition and bioactive components.

AB  - Ticks carry a diverse community of microorganisms including non-pathogenic symbionts, commensals, and pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, protozoans, and fungi. The assessment of tick-borne microorganisms (TBM) in tortoises and their ticks is essential to understand their eco-epidemiology, and to map and monitor potential pathogens to humans and other animals. The aim of this study was to characterize the diversity of microorganisms found in ticks collected from the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) in North Africa and Anatolia. Ticks feeding on wild T. graeca were collected, and pathogens were screened by polymerase chain reaction using group-specific primers. In total, 131 adult Hyalomma aegyptium ticks were collected from 92 T. graeca in Morocco (n = 48), Tunisia (n = 2), Algeria (n = 70), and Turkey (n = 11). Bacteria and protozoa detected included Hemolivia mauritanica (22.9%), Midichloria mitochondrii (11.4%), relapsing-fever borreliae (8.4%), Ehrlichia spp. (7.6%), Rickettsia spp. (3.4%), Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. (0.9%), Francisella spp. (0.9%), and Wolbachia spp. (0.8%). The characterization of Rickettsia included R. sibirica mongolitimonae (Algeria), R. aeschlimannii (Turkey), and R.africae (Morocco). Hemolivia mauritanica and Ehrlichia spp. prevalence varied significantly with the sampling region/country. We did not detect significant associations in microorganism presence within ticks, nor between microorganism presence and tick mitochondrial DNA haplogroups. This is the first report of Francisella persica-like, relapsing fever borreliae, M. mitochondrii, and Wolbachia spp. in H. aegyptium ticks collected from wild hosts from the South and Eastern Mediterranean region, and of R. sibirica mongolitimonae and R. africae in H. aegyptium from Algeria and Morocco, respectively. Given that T. graeca is a common species in commercial and non-commercial pet trade, the evaluation of the role of this species and its ticks as hosts for TBM is particularly relevant for public health.

AB  - Background. Tortoises of the genus Testudo are widely distributed throughout the Mediterranean region and southwestern Asia. However, the evolutionary mechanisms of diversification in this genus are still poorly understood. Methods. In this study, we assessed the evolutionary patterns in the climate niches of five species and 11 subspecies of the genus Testudo using ecological niche models and evaluated the niche overlap based on species phylogenetic distances. Results. The ecological models indicated that most species differ in their climate niches, but show overlap, with gradual transitions at range boundaries. As expected, the ecological divergence among subspecies was lower than that among species. Evaluation of the phylogenetic signal indicated that climate niches have been weakly conserved, but sister species also show high evolutionary divergence.

AB  - Survival is a key parameter in species' management and conservation. Most methods for estimating survival require time series data, large sample sizes and, overall, costly monitoring efforts. Inverse modeling approaches can be less data hungry, however they are underused in conservation sciences. Here we present an inverse modeling approach for estimating relative survival rates of long-lived species that is mathematically straightforward and evaluate its performance under constraints common in conservation studies related to small sample sizes. Specifically, we (i) estimated the relative survival rates in a Testudo graeca population based on one-year monitoring, (ii) assessed the impact of sample size on the accuracy, and (iii) tested alternative hypotheses on the impact of fire on the survival rates. We then compared the results of our approach with capture-recapture (CRC) estimates based on long-term monitoring. Our approach (153 individuals within a single year) yielded estimates of survival rates overlapping those of CRC estimates (11 years of data and 1009 individuals) for adults and subadults, but not for juveniles. Simulation experiments showed that our method provides robust estimates if sample size is above 100 individuals. The best models describing the impact of fire on survival identified by our approach predicts a decrease in survival especially in hatchlings and juvenile individuals, similar to CRC estimates. Our work proves that inverse modeling can decrease the cost for estimating demographic rates, especially for long-lived species and as such, its use should be encouraged in conservation and management sciences.
