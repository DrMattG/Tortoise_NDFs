AB  - Enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens was associated with diarrhea in a 4-yr-old female captive-bred red-footed tortoise (Geochelone carbonaria). Diagnosis was based on bacterial culture, detection of C. perfringens enterotoxin in feces, and exclusion of commonly recognized pathogens. After treatment with metronidazole, normal feces were passed and C. perfringens enterotoxin was no longer detected in the feces. Although the role of C. perfringens cannot be determined definitively from this case, this pathogen should be considered in cases of diarrhea in tortoises and, perhaps, other reptiles.

AB  - The aim of this study was to describe the topography of the spinal cord of the red-footed tortoise to establish a morphological basis for applied research in anesthesiology and morphology. Six tortoises from the state of Maranhao (Brazil) that had died of natural causes were used. The common carotid artery was used to perfuse the arterial system with saline solution (heated to 37 degrees C) and to fix the material with a 20% formaldehyde solution. The specimens were then placed in a modified decalcifying solution for 72 hours to allow dorsal opening of the carapace with a chisel and an orthopedic hammer. Dissection of the dorsal musculature and sectioning of the vertebral arches were performed to access the spinal cord. The results revealed the spinal cord of G. carbonaria to be an elongated, whitish mass that reached the articulation between the penultimate and last caudal vertebrae. The cervical intumescence (Intumescentia cervicalis) was located between vertebral segments C5 and T1, whereas the lumbosacral intumescence (Intumescentia lumbalis) was located between T6 and Ca1.

AB  - Gaze following refers to the ability of an animal to orient its gaze direction to that of another organism. Such a behavior may be adaptive as it alerts the observer to important objects in the environment such as food or predators. This behavior has been shown in mammals and birds, but the evolutionary history and the distribution of this behavior throughout the animal kingdom remain unclear. Here, we show that a reptile, the red-footed tortoise (Geochelone carbonaria), is able to follow the gaze of a conspecific in a lookup task. Controls revealed that neither the mere presence of a conspecific nor the presentation of a light stimulus (without a demonstrator present) controlled the tortoises' behavior. The findings indicate that the ability to follow gaze may be found in mammals, birds and reptiles and could have evolved before the amniotic line diverged, or may result from a general ability to learn.

AB  - There are few clinical reports of melanomas in reptiles. A 10-year-old male red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonaria) was referred to the Veterinary Hospital presenting with an ulcerated mass in the lateral aspect of the left pelvic limb. Radiographs demonstrated swelling and increased soft tissue density overlying the femur, tibia, and fibula, without bone involvement. Fine-needle aspiration cytology revealed innumerable round cells, with a defined cytoplasm filled with fine brown-black granules (melanin), which were considered well-differentiated melanocytes, suggesting a case of cutaneous melanoma. The mass was surgically removed. It was encapsulated and had an abundant blood supply. Histopathological examination revealed a well demarcated and encapsulated neoplastic proliferation of mesenchymal cells, with high cellularity and moderate fibrous stroma. Lymphangiectasia in the dermis adjacent to the tumor was also observed. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis, with cells staining positive for Melan-A antibody being observed in neoplastic proliferation, adjacent dermis, inside lymphatic vessels, and invading the delimiting tumor's capsule. There was no evidence of local or systemic recurrence of the neoplasm over 500 days after removal. Chelonians can be affected by cutaneous melanomas. Surgical removal in this case was curative.

AB  - Temperature effect on digestive response is still unknown in most reptile species as is the case with the red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonaria). Hatchlings were fed with two diets, one high in fiber (14.16% crude fiber, 39.20% neutral detergent fiber dry matter basis, DMB) and one high in starch (27.71% DMB), housed at 30 degrees C or 20 degrees C, to evaluate the temperature effect on food intake (FI), digesta passage, apparent digestive efficiency (Da), and growth. At 30 degrees C the animals showed higher FI and digestible energy (DEI), as well as metabolic mass-specific intake of digestible nutrients and energy (DEImm, 99.48 +/- 14.30 versus 43.18 +/- 17.26 kJ kg-0.86 day-1; P<0.001); daily gain (0.98 +/- 0.26 versus 0.32 +/- 0.11 g day-1; P<0.001), and growth of carapace length (0.25 +/- 0.05 versus 0.09 +/- 0.02 mm day-1; P<0.001) and width (0.15 +/- 0.03 versus 0.05 +/- 0.01 mm day-1; P<0.001). DEI at 30 degrees C was expressed: (R2=0.67). Non-diet effect was observed on digesta passage, however, at 20 degrees C the transit (5.50 +/- 1.36 versus 3.60 +/- 1.05 days; P<0.01) and retention times (13.80 +/- 1.29 versus 8.90 +/- 1.15 days; P<0.001) were longer than at 30 degrees C. Animals housed at colder conditions also presented lower gut content (30.39 +/- 13.39 versus 40.45 +/- 9.76 g Kg-1; P<0.05) and gut fill time (0.08 +/- 0.01 versus 0.02 +/- 0.01 g day-1; P<0.001). Da were similar between temperatures but due to the diet effect, hatchlings fed the high starch diet presented higher DM and energy coefficients. Environmental temperature influences the digestive response and growth of C. carbonaria. Overall digestive efficiency was temperatureindependent but rather influenced by diet quality and composition.

AB  - Computed tomography is a sensitive and highly applicable technique for determining the degree of radiographic attenuation of the hepatic parenchyma. Radiodensity measurements of the liver can help in the diagnosis of hepatic lipidosis in humans and animals. The objective was to investigate the presence of hepatic lipidosis in captive red-footed tortoises (Chelonoidis carbonaria) using computed tomography. Computed tomography was performed in 10 male red-footed tortoises. Mean radiographic attenuation values for the hepatic parenchyma were 11.2 +/- 3.0 Hounsfield units (HU). Seven red-footed tortoises had values lower than 20 HU, which is compatible with C. carbonaria hepatic lipidosis. These results allowed an early diagnosis of the hepatic changes and suggested corrective measures regarding feeding and management protocols.

AB  - The literature contains numerous reports of the effect of acupuncture on domestic or experimental animals, but only a few involving wild animals. This paper reports on acupuncture treatment for locomotor disabilities in a South American red-footed tortoise ( Geochelone carbonaria, SPIX, 1824), an endangered land tortoise found in Brazil's Cerrado region. The animal was captured and kept in an aquatic pen, subsequently developing respiratory symptoms and locomotor disabilities. The respiratory symptoms resolved in response to antibiotic treatment. However, despite the use of nutritional supplements, the motor symptoms remained unchanged. After 16 months, the tortoise was given six acupuncture sessions. No other changes were made to its environment or management. The location of the acupuncture points was transposed from canine charts. After acupuncture, the animal's motor functions, which had remained unchanged during the preceding 16 months, were restored, enabling it to eat and walk unaided. The improvement persisted during 18 months follow up. The transposition of acupuncture points from canine charts is a viable alternative for chelonians.

AB  - Intraocular pressure (IOP) reflects a balance between aqueous humor production and outflow and is often an essential ophthalmic diagnostic procedure in animals. The objective of this study was to estimate IOP in clinically normal red-footed tortoises (Geochelone carbonaria) of various sizes by using applanation tonometry. Intraocular pressures were estimated for 25 captive red-footed tortoises (10 males, 10 females, and 5 animals of unknown sex) by using an applanation tonometer after topical anesthesia. Body length ranged from 5.1 to 54.9 cm, measured from nuchal to anal scutes. Five measurements from each eye were obtained by a single observer in an ambient temperature of approximately 30degreesC. Observer's reliability was good (intraclass r = 0.75), and IOP did not change over the ordered sequence of five replicate measurements. For individual tortoises the correlation for IOP between the left and right eyes was low (r = 0.20). The paired t-test did not show any statistical effect (P = 0.426) for the difference in IOP between the left and right eyes. Mean IOP determined for 10 confirmed males and 10 confirmed females did not differ between sexes (P = 0.244). The mean IOP of five small tortoises (<10 cm long) was not significantly different (P = 0.244) from that of 20 large tortoises (>10 cm long). In red-footed tortoises there does not appear to be any relation between carapace length and IOP.

AB  - The occurrence of hepatic lipidosis is commonly reported in different reptilian species, especially in animals under captivity. Liver accumulation of fat is associated with disorders, better described in mammals as non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD), ranging from simple steatosis, to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and to more severe lesions of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Mitochondria play a central role in NAFLD pathogenesis, therefore in this study we characterized livers of ad libitum fed captive red-footed tortoise Chelo-noidis carbonaria through histological and mitochondrial function evaluations of juvenile and adult individuals. Livers from adult tortoises exhibited higher levels of lipids, melanomacrophages centers and melanin than ju-veniles. The observed high score levels of histopathological alterations in adult tortoises, such as microvesicular steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis, indicated the progression to a NASH condition. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption at different respiratory states and with different substrates was 30 to 58% lower in adult when compared to juvenile tortoises. Despite citrate synthase activity was also lower in adults, cardiolipin content was similar to juveniles, indicating that mitochondrial mass was unaffected by age. Mitochondrial Ca2+ retention capacity was reduced by 70% in adult tortoises. Overall, we found that aggravation of NAFLD in ad libitum fed captive tortoises is associated with compromised mitochondrial function, indicating a critical role of the organelle in liver disease progression in reptiles.

There is evidence that group-living mammals, birds, fishes and insects can learn through observation, but this has never been investigated in reptiles. Here, we show that the non-social red-footed tortoise (Geochelone carbonaria) can learn from the actions of a conspecific in a detour task; non-observer animals (without a conspecific demonstrator) failed. This result provides the first evidence that a non-social species can use social cues to solve a task that it cannot solve through individual learning, challenging the idea that social learning is an adaptation for social living.

AB  - Three hypotheses have attempted to explain the phenomenon of contagious yawning. It has been hypothesized that it is a fixed action pattern for which the releasing stimulus is the observation of another yawn, that it is the result of non-conscious mimicry emerging through close links between perception and action or that it is the result of empathy, involving the ability to engage in mental state attribution. This set of experiments sought to distinguish between these hypotheses by examining contagious yawning in a species that is unlikely to show nonconscious mimicry and empathy but does respond to social stimuli: the red-footed tortoise Geochelone carbonaria. A demonstrator tortoise was conditioned to yawn when presented with a red square-shaped stimulus. Observer tortoises were exposed to three conditions: observation of conditioned yawn, non demonstration control, and stimulus only control. We measured the number of yawns for each observer animal in each condition. There was no difference between conditions. Experiment 2 therefore increased the number of conditioned yawns presented. Again, there was no significant difference between conditions. It seemed plausible that the tortoises did not view the conditioned yawn as a real yawn and therefore a final experiment was run using video recorded stimuli. The observer tortoises were presented with three conditions: real yawn, conditioned yawns and empty background. Again there was no significant difference between conditions. We therefore conclude that the red-footed tortoise does not yawn in response to observing a conspecific yawn. This suggests that contagious yawning is not the result of a fixed action pattern but may involve more complex social processes [Current Zoology 57 (4): 477-484, 2011].

AB  - This is the first report about a disease known as hepatic lipidosis (steatosis) and cirrhosis in this kind of animal. The gross and microscopic lesions are described. It is important to emphasise that this pathological process has a multifactorial etiology such as, over and underfeeding, some bacterial toxins along with lack of proteins or enzymes as well as toxic agents and some medicaments. Therefore, its etiopathogenesis is discussed.

AB  - The radial-arm maze is an established method for testing an animal's spatial win-shift behavior. Research on mammals, birds, and fish has shown that the mastery of this task is commonly mediated, to different degrees, by two types of strategy: those based on external cues and those based on response stereotypy. In the present study we trained four red-footed tortoises (Geochelone carbonaria) to navigate an eight-arm radial maze while providing different levels of access to visual room cues. The results indicate that response stereotypy is the more prevalent mechanism in these tortoises, although navigation based on landmarks can also occur if learned initially. The findings suggest that tortoise spatial navigation may be more similar to that observed in mammals and birds than previously thought.

AB  - The ejection fraction of the trabeculated cardiac ventricle of reptiles has not previously been measured. Here, we used the gold standard clinical methodology - electrocardiogram-gated flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - to validate stroke volume measurements and end diastolic ventricular blood volume. This produced an estimate of ejection fraction in our study species, the red footed tortoise Chelonoidis carbonarius (n=5), under isoflurane anaesthesia of 88 +/- 11%. After reduction of the prevailing right-to-left intraventricular shunt through the action of atropine, the ejection fraction was 96 +/- 6%. This methodology opens new avenues for studying the complex hearts of ectotherms, and validating hypotheses on the function of a more highly trabeculated heart than that of endotherms, which have lower ejection fractions.

AB  - Herein it was describe sonographic morphology and sintopy of the bowels of the coelomic cavity in the red-footed tortoise. Coelomic cavity of 19 males and 19 females were scanned through cervical and prefemoral access with a multifrequency sector transducer. Morphology, syntopy and echogenicity of the heart, thyroid, liver, gallbladder, reproductive organs, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, urinary bladder and kidneys were evaluated. The heart showed two atria and one ventricle with a thick, trabecular wall. The thyroid was oval and hyperecoic, visualized in the cardiac portion of the ultrasound. The liver, gallbladder and digestive system were similar to those seen in mammals and turtles. However, the tortoise liver was relatively more hyperechoic than mammals. The kidneys appeared as triangular structures, which were hypoechoic, homogeneous and vascularized; the bladder was observed mostly as being elongated with anechoic content, and its wall appeared as a thin hyperechoic line when free fluid was present. The testes were observed to be elongated, homogeneous and more hyperechoic than kidneys. The ovarian follicles were seen as hyperechoic, echogenic balls of variable size and quantity, the oviduct as a sigmoid tubular structure and the eggs as thin hyperechoic lines with posterior acoustic shadowing. In some animals, there were variable amounts of fluid around the heart and in the coelomic cavity.

AB  - Captive terrestrial tortoises of the species Chelonoidis carbonaria (n=17) and Chelonoidis denticulata (n=37) in the state of Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil, were examined for hematozoans by using a combination of microscopic and molecular methods. Microscopic examination revealed young intra-erythrocytic forms in blood smears from both species of tortoises. The results of PCR, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis indicated that these parasites belonged to the Haemoproteus spp., whose observed prevalence was 17.6 % in C. carbonaria and 13.5 % in C. denticulata. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that these sequences formed a clade that was grouped with other sequences of Haemoproteus spp. parasites in birds, separate from the clade formed by Haemoproteus spp. of reptiles. This study expands the information regarding the occurrence and distribution of hemosporidia in turtles and is the first study of blood parasites in C. carbonaria.

AB  - The homology model of hemoglobin D from Geochelone carbonaria, the red-footed tortoise was predicted using the 3D structure coordinates of Geochelone gigantea hemoglobin D as the template. The model was built using the program, MODELLER (8v1) and evaluated with PROCHECK and PROSA. The present study features an in-depth analysis of the 3D model and its conformational changes brought about with variations in its environment. These structural changes are correlated with its ability to adapt to different environmental constraints enabling the organism to better suit to its natural habitat. The model shows additional contacts between amino acid pairs of alpha-119 and beta-55, alpha-35 and beta-124, alpha-103 and beta-112, alpha-115 and beta-116, alpha-120 and beta-52, alpha-120 and beta-55, alpha-36 and beta-127 which are not found in human hemoglobin. It is predicted that these contacts may result in T-state stabilization thus lowering oxygen affinity. Furthermore, decrease in the interaction of phosphate heteroatoms with the amino acid residues of G. carbonaria Hb was also predicted in this study.

AB  - The intranuclear coccidian parasite of Testudines (TINC) is an emerging pathogen of tortoises. Three captive red-footed tortoises (Chelonoidis carbonaria) from an isolated collection presented with multiple acute, nonspecific clinical signs. One tortoise died and was diagnosed with intranuclear coccidiosis on histopathology with confirmation by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). In addition to tissues where TINC has been previously described, coccidia were identified in the pineal gland, choroid plexus, and testicular Sertoli cells. The two remaining tortoises survived after treatment with oral ponazuril (20 mg/kg every 48 hr for 56 days) and remained asymptomatic, although not cleared of infection, for 21 months, as the number of coccidian gene copies detected by qPCR was reduced in one tortoise. This report extends the known host range of this parasite to continental South American tortoises, describes new sites of infection by histopathology, and has management implications for this disease.

AB  - Tortoise husbandry includes reports of excessive growth and carapace pyramiding, although triggers still remain to be fully elucidated. Juvenile red-footed tortoises (Chelonoidis carbonaria) were fed with two different diets, one high in fiber (HF; 14.2% crude fiber; 39.2% neutral detergent fiber, NDF; dry matter basis, DMB) and one high in starch (HS; 27.7% DMB), to assess effects on energy metabolism, nutrient digestibility, and growth. A total of 20 hatchlings (10 per diet) were used to evaluate: apparent digestibility coefficients (Da) of nutrients and gross energy (GE), passage times at 5 and 11 months of age; resting and post-prandial metabolic rates at 6 and 12 months of age; growth rates; pyramiding; and estimated body composition. Animals fed HS showed higher mass-specific intake of digestible energy (113.9 +/- 32.1 kJ kg(-1) day(-1) vs. 99.6 +/- 35.3 kJ kg(-1) day(-1); P < 0.05), digestible DM (6.1 +/- 1.8 g kg(-1) day(-1) vs. 5.0 +/- 1.8 g kg(-1) day(-1); P < 0.01), shorter transit (3 +/- 1 days vs. 4 +/- 1 days; P < 0.01) and retention times (8 +/- 2 days vs. 10 +/- 2 days; P < 0.01), and higher Da of DM, starch, NDF, and GE. Crude protein Da was higher for HF. Rest and post-prandial metabolic rates, and pyramiding degree were not affected by diets. At 13 months, the animals from HS presented wider plastrons and carapaces, and higher carapace width growth rates. In addition, these animals had lower body mineral content (1.88 +/- 0.15% vs. 2.15 +/- 0.19%; P < 0.01) and bone density (0.13 +/- 0.01 g mm(-2) vs. 0.15 +/- 0.02 g mm(-2); P < 0.02). Results provide evidence that highly digestible foods can accelerate shell growth and lower mineralization in this species.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify and describe intestinal lesions caused by helminths in red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonarius) and yellow-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis denticulatus) reared in captivity in the Zoo and Botanical Park of Teresina, Piaui State, Brazil. The parasitological evaluation of 142 of these tortoises revealed that all were parasitized by helminths (ascarids and strongyles), which were identified by light and electron microscopy as Atractis thapari and Chapiniella variabilis. The 12 most parasitized tortoises (six per species) were euthanized, and samples of small and large intestine were evaluated by histopathology. Macroscopically, all small and large intestines had hyperaemia. Microscopically, hyperaemia (12/12), diffuse goblet cell hyperplasia (8/12) and submucosa oedema (1/12) were observed in the small intestine. Hyperaemia was observed in the large intestine, varying from discrete to intense (12/12) and focally extensive and severe transmural granulomatous enteritis (1/12).

AB  - Seed dispersal by frugivores is essential in plant life cycles, with birds and mammals the principal and well studied dispersal agents. However, there is an increasing recognition that terrestrial tortoises could also be considered important seed dispersers in many ecosystems. The red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonaria) is one of the largest terrestrial tortoises in South America and is thought to disperse large seeds. However, little is known about their role as seed dispersers, and their potential use as restorers of defaunated areas. Here, we assessed the maximum width of seeds this species could ingest, the mean gut retention time (GRT), and the post consumption germination capacity for tropical fruit species. Forty different fruit species were offered to eight captive individuals, obtaining a maximum seed width swallowed of 23 mm. We used four native plant species to measure the GRT within four tortoises, and we found a mean retention time of 18.92 & PLUSMN; 4.81 days. We also found that sex is an important indicator of GRT, with females presenting longer retention periods. This novel finding may be due to the higher metabolic defecating and dispersing rates of males. Although germination proportions varied between the four plant species used in the experiment, overall defecated seeds germinated faster than control seeds. We conclude that red-footed tortoises are potentially important seed dispersers due to their ability to swallow a large quantity and size of seeds while accelerating seed germination rates. This species should be considered a viable ecological substitute for large frugivores in rewilding projects, as C. carbonaria performs similar functions to large dispersers that have been extirpated due to defaunation processes.

AB  - This study identifies the endoparasites in Red-footed tortoises (Chelonoidis carbonaria) during March 2018 to March 2019 from Grenada, West Indies. Fecal samples from a total of 103 tortoises were collected and examined by simple fecal floatation techniques for parasitic eggs and oocysts. Adult parasites found in the feces were examined under the microscope for identification based on their morphology. Fecal samples for this research were collected from four parishes; St. Andrew, St George. St. John and St. Patrick. The overall prevalence of intestinal parasites among tortoises was 14.6%.
   The internal parasites consisted of nematodes belonging to three genera: Atractis, Labiduris and Proarractis. The most prevalent nematodes were Atractis spp. (86.7%), which included two species: A. thapari (7.7%) and A. marquezi (15.4%) followed by Labiduris gulosa (20%) and Proatractis parvicapiticaronata (13.3%). All nematodes of three genera found in red-footed tortoises in Grenada are reported for the first time. They are not zoonotic but are serious pathogens for tortoises.

AB  - A chorioallantoic membrane artery in embryos of the red-footed tortoise, Chelonoidis carbonaria was occlusively cannulated for measurement of blood pressure and injection of drugs. Two age groups of embryos in the final 10 % of incubation were categorized by the ratio of embryonic body to yolk mass. All embryos first received cholinergic and beta-adrenergic blockade. This revealed that beta-adrenergic control was established in both groups whereas cholinergic control was only established in the older group immediately prior to hatching. The study then progressed as two series. Series one was conducted in a subset of embryos treated with histamine before or after injection of ranitidine, the antagonist of H-2 receptors. Injection of histamine caused an initial phasic hypertension which recovered, followed by a longer lasting hypertensive response accompanied by a tachycardia. Injection of the H-2 receptor antagonist ranitidine itself caused a hypotensive tachycardia with subsequent recovery of heart rate. Ranitidine also abolished the cardiac effects of histamine injection while leaving the initial hypertensive response intact. In series, two embryos were injected with histamine after injection of diphenhydramine, the antagonist to H-1 receptors. This abolished the whole of the pressor response to histamine injection but left the tachycardic response intact. These data indicate that histamine acts as a non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic factor, regulating the cardiovascular system of developing reptilian embryos and that its overall effects are mediated via both H-1 and H-2 receptor types.

AB  - Wide-ranging species are seldom considered conservation priorities, yet they have the potential to harbour genetically deeply differentiated units across environments or ecological barriers, including some that warrant taxonomic recognition. Documenting such cryptic genetic diversity is especially important for wide-ranging species that are in decline, as they may comprise a set of even more endangered lineages or species with small distributions. However, studies of wide-ranging species, particularly when they cross political borders, are extremely challenging. One approach to overcoming these challenges is to conduct detailed local analyses in combination with less detailed, range-wide studies. We used this approach with the red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonarius), a threatened species likely to contain cryptic diversity given its vast range and the distinctive ecoregions that it inhabits. Previous single-gene molecular studies indicated the presence of at least five lineages, two of which occur in different ecoregions separated by the Andes within Colombia. We used a comprehensive genomic analysis to test the hypothesis of cryptic diversity within the single jurisdiction of Colombia. We used a combination of restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing and environmental niche modelling to provide three independent lines of evidence that support the presence of important cryptic diversity that may deserve taxonomic recognition: allopatric reproductive isolation, local adaptation and ecological divergence. We also provide a fine-scale genetic map with the distribution of conservation units in Colombia. As we complete ongoing range-wide analyses and make taxonomic adjustments, we recommend that the two lineages in Colombia be treated as separate units for conservation purposes.

AB  - Coccidial disease is significant in tortoises; Testudines intranuclear coccidiosis (TINC), caused by an unnamed coccidia, causes high mortality in diverse tortoise species. There is a lack of information on anticoccidial drugs in tortoises. The drug ponazuril has demonstrated efficacy in treating mammals infected with similar coccidial disease. Previous empirical use of ponazuril in TINC cases suggests that it may be an effective treatment. In this study, 20 mg/kg of ponazuril was orally administered to tortoises with the goal of achieving blood concentrations known to be effective for anticoccidial therapy in mammals. Ponazuril was measured in tortoise plasma, and noncompartmental analyses of pharmacokinetic parameters were attempted. Ponazuril in these tortoises did not achieve the desired concentrations known to be effective for anticoccidial treatment in mammals. Tortoises showed prolonged oral absorption, and despite sampling for 168 hr (1 wk), a terminal elimination rate constant and half-life were not able to be determined. Additional studies are needed to fully characterize ponazuril pharmacokinetics in red-footed tortoises. The optimal dose for treating TINC remains to be determined.

AB  - Reptile embryos respond to temperature changes with metabolic and physiological adjustments that influence hatchling success, phenotype, behaviour, and growth rate. Climate change and global warming can affect the reptile population by altering the frequencies of hatchling survival and phenotypes. Therefore, previous studies proposed artificial incubation as a potential strategy for mitigating these effects. Red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonaria) eggs were collected and incubated at constant temperatures of 27.5 degrees C and 29.5 degrees C to investigate the physiological effects of temperature on embryo development, hatchling morphology, and early post-hatch growth rate. The direct effect of temperature on the incubation period, egg mass loss, hatching success, hatchling size, and mass was evaluated at hatching and three months of age. Hatchlings from 29.5 degrees C presented a shorter incubation period (141 days) than those from 27.5 degrees C (201 days; p < 0.05). Egg mass loss, hatchling mass, and size at hatching were not different between the incubation temperatures (p > 0.05). However, the hatching success (survival rate) was lower (64.5% versus 100%) in eggs incubated at 29.5 degrees C, but the hatchling mass and straight plastron width were higher at three months of age than those from eggs incubated at 27.5 degrees C (p < 0.05). These results indicate that incubation temperature influences hatching success and hatchling size and mass in the first months by influencing the early growth rate.

AB  - Understanding reproductive biology and embryonic development is vital to guide conservation programs for endangered species. The Red-footed Tortoise, Chelonoidis carbonarius, is a vulnerable species for which the sex determination mechanism and the transitional temperatures range are unknown. In an attempt to obtain this information, we incubated 145 eggs (38 nests) at 3 constant temperatures: 29 degrees C, 31 degrees C, and 33 degrees C. All embryos incubated at 33 degrees C (n = 49) died during the first third of the incubation period. Of the eggs incubated at 31 degrees C (n = 47), only 10.6% hatched, and 2.12% of the embryos showed malformations of the carapace, head, or legs. Of the eggs incubated at 29 degrees C (n = 49), 52% hatched successfully with 10.2% exhibiting body malformations. From the 30 neonates obtained, we were able to sex 20 individuals by laparoscopies, 2 by gonads histology, 1 was impossible to identify because of the small sizes of the gonads at the time of death, and the remaining were released back to their tortoise origin of collection without being sexed. These results suggest that C. carbonarius exhibits a temperature-dependent sex determination mechanism with females produced at, or above, 29 degrees C. Our incidental findings of embryo malformations, asynchronous hatching, and incomplete yolk absorption suggest that this species may be able to arrest embryonic development via embryonic diapause, aestivation, or both. Future studies should focus on the developmental biology of this species including confirmation of the production of males at temperatures below 29 degrees C.

AB  - To recognize that a picture is a representation of a real-life object is a cognitively demanding task. It requires an organism to mentally represent the concrete object (the picture) and abstract its relation to the item that it represents. This form of representational insight has been shown in a small number of mammal and bird species. However, it has not previously been studied in reptiles. This study examined picture-object recognition in the red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonaria). In Experiment 1, five red-footed tortoises were trained to distinguish between food and non-food objects using a two-alternative forced choice procedure. After reaching criterion, they were presented with test trials in which the real objects were replaced with color photographs of those objects. There was no difference in performance between training and test trials, suggesting that the tortoises did see some correspondence between the real object and its photographic representation. Experiment 2 examined the nature of this correspondence by presenting the tortoises with a choice between the real food object and a photograph of it. The findings revealed that the tortoises confused the photograph with the real-life object. This suggests that they process real items and photographic representations of these items in the same way and, in this context, do not exhibit representational insight.

AB  - Much research has investigated spatial cognition in mammals and birds. Evidence suggests that the hippocampus plays a critical role in this; however, reptiles do not possess a hippocampus. It has been proposed that the reptilian medial cortex plays a similar role, yet little behavioral research has directly investigated this. Consequently, this study examined the role of extramaze cues in spatial navigation by the red-footed tortoise (Geochelone carbonaria) using an eight-arm radial maze. In Experiment 1 the maze was surrounded by a black curtain on which geometrical shapes were attached. After the tortoise reached above-chance performance we introduced test sessions in which the cues were removed. Performance was unaffected by cue removal. The tortoise appeared to have developed a "turn-by-one-arm" strategy. In a second experiment the curtain was removed and the tortoise was allowed access to a rich-cue environment. The use of the turn-by-one-arm strategy was significantly reduced and the tortoise appeared to be using the extramaze cues to navigate around the apparatus. This type of response-based strategy, and the specific contexts in which it was used, has not been observed in mammals and birds, suggesting that the mechanisms served by the reptilian medial cortex do not parallel exactly those of the hippocampus.

AB  - In the Bolivian Chaco, the tortoise Chelonoidis carbonaria is an important reptile for indigenous people for subsistence purposes and in traditional medicine. This article describes research on seasonal activity, daily activity, and burrow use for the species at two long-term research camps in the Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park. The principal research method is the use of internal and external temperature dataloggers in 15 individuals over a two-year period. Tortoises reduce their activity in the dry season, and are not active when air temperatures are below 20 degrees C or above 37 degrees C, though they can be active outside burrows at any time of year. Body temperature varies from 4 degrees C in winter (monthly average of minimum daily temperatures) to 38 degrees C in summer (monthly average of maximum daily temperatures). The instantaneous difference between body and environmental temperature could be as great as -23 degrees C or +12 degrees C, but the monthly average was between -2 degrees C and +4 degrees C. Tortoises rely principally on shelters including fallen trees, dense bromeliad ground cover, and leaf mulch; but also use armadillo burrows and rock crevices. They use multiple shelters /burrows over time, occasionally sharing shelters with other individuals. Burrow use is important both in cold periods as well as in hot and dry periods. The dataloggers provided extremely detailed data on body and environmental temperature, but the implantation caused problems in several individuals and the procedure may need modifications.

AB  - The interaction between supraphysiological cytosolic Ca2+ levels and mitochondrial redox imbalance mediates the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). The MPT is involved in cell death, diseases and aging. This study compared the liver mitochondrial Ca2+ retention capacity and oxygen consumption in the long-lived red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonada) with those in the rat as a reference standard. Mitochondrial Ca2+ retention capacity, a quantitative measure of MPT sensitivity, was remarkably higher in tortoises than in rats. This difference was minimized in the presence of the MPT inhibitors ADP and cyclosporine A. However, the Ca2+ retention capacities of tortoise and rat liver mitochondria were similar when both MPT inhibitors were present simultaneously. NADH-linked phosphorylating respiration rates of tortoise liver mitochondria represented only 30% of the maximal electron transport system capacity, indicating a limitation imposed by the phosphorylation system. These results suggested underlying differences in putative MPT structural components [e.g. ATP synthase, adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) and cyclophilin D] between tortoises and rats. Indeed, in tortoise mitochondria, titrations of inhibitors of the oxidative phosphorylation components revealed a higher limitation of ANT. Furthermore, cyclophilin D activity was approximately 70% lower in tortoises than in rats. Investigation of critical properties of mitochondrial redox control that affect MPT demonstrated that tortoise and rat liver mitochondria exhibited similar rates of H2O2 release and glutathione redox status. Overall, our findings suggest that constraints imposed by ANT and cyclophilin D, putative components or regulators of the MPT pore, are associated with the enhanced resistance to Ca2+-induced MPT in tortoises.

AB  - Optical illusions have been widely used to compare visual perception among vertebrates because they can reveal how the system is able to adapt to visual input. Sensitivity to visual illusions has never been studied in reptiles. Here, we investigated whether red-footed tortoises, Chelonoidis carbonaria, and bearded dragons, Pogona vitticeps, perceive the Delboeuf illusion. This illusion involves the misperception of the size of a target circle depending upon the context in which it is presented. We adopted the same size discrimination for both species to compare their performance. Animals were presented with two different types of trials. In control trials, they received two different-sized food portions on two plates of the same size. In test trials, they received two same-sized food portions but presented on two different-sized plates. If they perceived the illusion in the same way as humans, we expected them to select the food portion presented on the smaller plate. The tortoises exhibited poor performance in the control trials, which prevented us from drawing any conclusions about their perception of the Delboeuf illusion. In contrast, the bearded dragons selected the larger amount of food in control trials. In test trials, they selected the portion presented on the smaller plate significantly more often than chance, suggesting a human-like sensitivity to the Delboeuf illusion. Our study provides the first evidence of the perception of a visual illusion in a reptile species, suggesting that rather than simply detecting visual input, they interpret sensory information captured by photoreceptors.

AB  - Incubation temperature is a factor that can affect several traits in turtles such as body size, growth, shape, and sex in species with temperature-dependent sex determination. A clear understanding of these effects is particularly important in threatened species such as the red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonarius), classified in Colombia as Vulnerable mainly due to the capture of wild individuals to be kept as pets. A previous study on the effect of incubation temperature on sex determination concluded that constant temperatures of 31 degrees C and 33 degrees C are lethal to C. carbonarius embryos and that a temperature of 29 degrees C produces 100% females. Although this showed that C. carbonarius has a temperature-based sex determination mechanism, its full reaction norm is still unknown. To fill in the gaps, we incubated 160 eggs from 47 nests at constant temperatures of 24 degrees C, 26 degrees C, and 28 degrees C. The hatching success rates were 55%, 53%, and 60%, respectively, with extremely long incubation periods of 213, 164, and 138 d. Of the 75 neonates obtained, 58 reached 8 mo of age, at which time 45% (rs = 26) were sexed. The sexual proportions (% males) obtained were 88.9%, 60%, and 0% from the 24 degrees C, 26 degrees C, and 28 degrees C treatments. From the calculated thermal reaction norm, we estimated that the pivotal temperature is 26.05 degrees C (95% CI = 25.31-26.69) and the transitional temperature range is from 2434 degrees C to 27.77 degrees C. Incubation temperature also affected incubation period and hatchling body size and growth. Additionally, we found a significant effect of female body size and mass on egg size and mass, supporting a fecundity selection hypothesis of body size. Finally, we inspected hatchlings for sexual shape dimorphism using geometric morphometrics. We found significant differences in anal notch and plastron shape at 7 d of age, but only differences for anal notch at 1 and 2 mo of age. However, the statistical signal was weak and the results varied with age; thus this sexing technique was unreliable. Given the low critical thermal maxima for embryo survivorship (31 degrees C or less), together with a 100% feminizing temperature of 27.9 degrees C, global climate change coupled with deforestation constitute imminent threats to this species due to demographic impacts such as low recruitment rates and skewed primary sex ratios.

TI  - "Ancient DNA" reveals that the scientific name for an extinct tortoise from Cape Verde refers to an extant South American species
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - We examined the type material of the extinct tortoise species Geochelone atlantica Lopez-Jurado, Mateo and Garcia-Marquez, 1998 from Sal Island, Cape Verde, using aDNA approaches and AMS radiocarbon dating. High-quality mitochondrial genomes obtained from the three type specimens support that all type material belongs to the same individual. In phylogenetic analyses using mitochondrial genomes of all species groups and genera of extant and some recently extinct tortoises, the type material clusters within the extant South American red-footed tortoise Chelonoidis carbonarius (Spix, 1824). Our radiocarbon date indicates that the tortoise from which the type series of G. atlantica originates was still alive during 1962 and 1974. These results provide firm evidence that the type material of G. atlantica does not belong to the Quaternary tortoise bones excavated on Sal Island in the 1930s, as originally thought. Thus, the extinct tortoise species remains unstudied and lacks a scientific name, and the name G. atlantica has to be relegated into the synonymy of C. carbonarius. The circumstances that led to this confusion currently cannot be disentangled.

AB  - Red-footed Tortoises (Chelonoidis carbonaria Spix, 1824) raised as pets and voluntarily handed over to environmental officers by their owners or apprehended by officers represent a large contingent of animals that overfill triage centres in Brazil. There is no consensus on the fate of these animals, and their numbers continue growing. In this study, we evaluated the movement patterns of C. carbonaria originating from triage centres in areas of cocoa plantations and forest remnants to define their home range and dispersion. After 120 days of quarantine and acclimatisation, eight C. carbonaria adults were released and monitored via radio telemetry for 10 months. The radio transmitters of two individuals presented problems, and consequently, it was not possible to track these individuals. Five individuals remained in an area of 7.75 ha 10 months after release, avoiding contact with humans after the first three months. The greatest problems were the proximity of individuals to inhabited areas in the first three months after release, the death of two individuals, and the escape of one individual. After the experiment, the animals were sent back to the triage centre. Our results suggest that a proportion of the animals in the triage centres are able to survive in natural conditions. Considering their survival and fidelity to the release site, the translocation of animals described herein should be considered partially successful. However, if this measure is adopted, it must be preceded by studies of the animals' origins and by a rigorous genetic, sanitary and behavioural analysis of each individual.

AB  - A single tortoise (Geochelone carbonaria) was trained in an eight-arm radial maze, with the apparatus and general procedures modeled on those used to demonstrate spatial learning in rats. The tortoise learned to perform reliably above chance, preferentially choosing baited arms, rather than returning to arms previously visited on a trial. Test sessions that examined control by olfactory cues revealed that they did not affect performance. No systematic, stereotyped response patterns were evident. In spite of differences in brain structure, the tortoise showed spatial learning abilities comparable to those observed in mammals.

AB  - Hermaphroditism is a term used to describe animals that have genitals of both genders. This anomaly has been described in reptiles such as lizards and snakes. The jabuti species Geochelone carbonaria hull has a high and very concave bone which is covered by corneal plates with yellow spots at the center, and collect the neck caudally into the hull. Although sexual dimorphism is externally quite clear, the females have straight plastron, while the male presents a clear concave plastron that serves to facilitate the mounting and a well developed penis having the size of the animal body. However, hermaphroditism in this species can only be confirmed with additional exams.

T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
LA  - English
KW  - HOMINIS
AB  - The growth of axenic reptilian isolates of Blastocystis in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) was studied and the morphology of the parasite was examined by phase-contrast microscopy. The chromosomal patterns of these reptilian isolates of Blastocystis were examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and compared with those of B. hominis and B. lapemi, a sea snake Blastocystis. IMDM with 10% horse serum supported excellent growth of the reptilian Blastocystis isolates. The parasites from all the isolates were predominantly vacuolar, but multivacuolar and amoeboid forms were also seen. Amoeboid forms with rather elongate pseudopodia were also observed. There were some differences in size, morphology, and growth characteristics in the different reptilian isolates. The karyotypic patterns of the Blastocystis isolates from tortoise, iguana, and python were distinctly different from one another and from those obtained with B. hominis and B. lapemi. On the basis of the above-mentioned differences in chromosomal patterns, the tortoise, iguana, and python isolates are described as new species, viz., B. geocheloni sp. nov. from Geochelone carbonaria (red-footed tortoise), B. cycluri sp, nov. from Cyclura cornuta (rhino iguana), and B. pythoni sp. nov. from Python reticulatus (reticulated python).

AB  - Knowledge of energy requirements is necessary to optimise the nutritional management of animals. For tortoises, very little is known about their nutrient and energy requirements. Data on substrate oxidation and the implications of starch or fat intake on the energy metabolism are lacking. The present study compared the daily energy expenditures (DEE) of red-footed tortoises (Chelonoidis carbonaria) that were fed three extruded diets: a control diet high in fibre and two test diets, one with high starch content and another with high fat content. A total of 18 tortoises (5.5 +/- 1.18 kg) were used in a completely randomised design, with 6 animals per diet. After 14 months of experimental diet intake and 48 h of preliminary fasting, the animals were kept for 12 h in 70-l respiratory chambers. An open "push mode" system was used to determine the carbon dioxide production and oxygen consumption levels for the subsequent calculations of DEE. The data were analysed with ANOVA, and the means were compared by using Tukey's test (p < 0.05). The body weights, chamber temperatures and food intakes of the tortoises were similar among the treatments (p > 0.05). There were no significant differences in oxygen consumption (21.7 +/- 3.16 ml center dot kg(-1) center dot h(-1)), carbon dioxide production (18.1 +/- 1.96 ml center dot kg(-1) center dot h(-1)), or DEE (9.7 +/- 1.04 kJ center dot kg(-1) d(-1)) between diets or sex (p > 0.05). The respiratory quotients (0.84 +/- 0.11) were also similar among the diets (p > 0.05). The DEE of red footed tortoises did not differ after a long-term starch or fat intake.

AB  - The scleral ossicle rings function has been related to mechanical protection, muscle fixation, support for eyeball shape and visual accommodation. There are few morphobiometric reports on these rings in different Testudines species, and we performed ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) of the scleral ossicle rings in one green turtle (Chelonia mydas), one black-bellied slider (Trachemys dorbigni) and one red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonarius). The US and CT of the ossicle rings were performed for anatomical identification. The thickness, density, width, and diameters of each ring were measured. The US and CT of the scleral ossicle rings of three animals showed single and continuous circular structures, located in the anterior pole. These structures were easily observed in C. mydas, whose rings were the biggest, thickest and widest. The T. dorbigni CT presented decreased dimensions and the ossicles were the most difficult to identify. Bone density in the superior region was greater than in the inferior of each ring in all animals. Non-invasive imaging exams are good tools to study the anatomy of the ocular skeleton. The scleral ossicle rings of the three specimens presented general morphological similarities and CT enabled visualizing a greater number of details of the ring bone morphology.

AB  - An adult specimen of "Jaboty-piranga" (Geochelone carbonaria), female, weighing 3.5 kg, was attended in the Doctor-school Dr. Luiz Cataldi de Souza of the University Centre Serra dos Orgaos - Teresopolis, Rio de Janeiro, presenting historically of eggs retention. By means of physical and radiografic examination the presence of three eggs was noted in normal positions. Because of being a reproductive station, the observation of the animal was advised to the owner, a year later, the tortoise was returned to the clinic because of not having expelled the eggs. After new radiografic examination, the presence of three eggs in the same positions was diagnosed, and 0.03 mL of oxitocine was applied, for subcutaneous road in the previous appendix of the animal. Passed three hours of the application of the hormone, the female of giant tortoise-pauper expelled the eggs naturally, no surgical intervention was needed.

AB  - In order to determine the reproductive strategy of Goechelone carbonaria, inasmuch egg production and its relationship with body size, three groups (I, II, III) of 12 females each were selected, with averages of 364.50, 303.75 and 254.66mm, respectively, in lineal size of the carapace. The selected specimens were kept under similar nutritional and density conditions. The observations were made between May 1997 and March 1998. Very few variations were found with respect to the average number of nests per group, without any tendency in relation to the size of the female. The total number of eggs per female per season increased with female size. Statistically significant differences were found between the three groups with respect to egg size (maximal length, minimal lenght and volume) and nest size, all of which increased together with the female size. The duration of the reproductive season of groups I, II and III was 160, 207 and 191 days, respectively, suggesting that larger animals improve their performance with a reduced nesting season. There, were no significant differences in the incubation time according to egg size. The results corroborate that this species does not behave according to the theory of the optimum egg size. A record maximum of 8 nests per season and a record nest size of 13 eggs are reported.

AB  - Geochelone carbonaria hemoglobin (Hb) was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and purified by ion exchange chromatography on CM-cellulose. Seven fractions were obtained using flesh Hb preparations. CM-cellulose chromatography of Hb reacted with iodoacetamide, showed one minor (HbI) and one major band (HbII). Analysis of the molecular masses of recently collected Hb and of aged solutions determined by gel filtration showed that polymerization increased with the duration of storage. The reaction with oxidized glutathione changed the electrophoretic pattern of Hb, and highlighted the bands corresponding to glutathionyl-Hb. The presence of these bands in fresh Hb solutions and in alkylated preparations suggests that they may occur in vivo. PAGE under dissociating conditions showed that the hemolysate contained 3 different polypeptide chains (G(1), G(2) and G(3)). Both Hb components shared the G(1) globin chain with HbI containing G(1) and G(2) and HbII, G(1) and G(3) chains.

AB  - The hemoglobin of the terrestrial tortoise Geochelone carbonaria was separated into two major components by ion exchange chromatography. The oxygen binding properties of both the unfractionated hemolysate and the separated components were investigated. The stripped hemoglobin of G. carbonaria displayed an oxygen affinity of approximately 6.3 mm Hg at pH 7.4 with a Bohr effect of about -0.55. The Hb-O-2 binding properties were also studied in the presence of the organic polyphosphates ATP and IHP. Inositol hexaphosphate (IHP) was more effective in lowering oxygen affinity, yielding a P-50 Of 20.1 mm Hg at pH 7.4. The n(50) value were quite low in the stripped form of the protein (1.0-1.9) but increased in the presence of both organic phosphates, attaining a value of approximately 2.9 at pH 7.9. The oxygen binding properties of the major hemo globin components were also investigated in the presence and absence of organic phosphates, and the values were compared with those obtained for the total hemolysate.

AB  - In recent years red-footed tortoises have been shown to be proficient in a number of spatial cognition tasks that involve movement of the animal through space (e.g., the radial maze). The present study investigated the ability of the tortoise to learn a spatial task in which the response required was simply to touch a stimulus presented in a given position on a touchscreen. We also investigated the relation between this task and performance in a different spatial task (an arena, in which whole-body movement was required). Four red-footed tortoises learned to operate the touchscreen apparatus, and two learned the simple spatial discrimination. The side-preference trained with the touchscreen was maintained when behaviour was tested in a physical arena. When the contingencies in the arena were then reversed, the tortoises learned the reversal but in a subsequent test did not transfer it to the touchscreen. Rather they chose the side that had been rewarded originally on the touchscreen. The results show that red-footed tortoises are able to operate a touchscreen and can successfully solve a spatial two-choice task in this apparatus. There was some indication that the preference established with the touchscreen could transfer to an arena, but with subsequent training in the arena independent patterns of choice were established that could be evoked according to the test context.

AB  - We studied changes in a population of red-footed Amazonian tortoises, Geochelone carbonaria, consequent to isolation in an insular forest fragment. Altered age structure, population density and body growth rate are shown here for the first time to be associated responses. Age structure was strongly biased toward juveniles and growth rates were reduced compared to the mainland. Our data suggest that density-dependent processes induced by habitat fragmentation changed demography and life history parameters in a scant 16 years.

AB  - 1 Most previous studies of terrestrial ectotherms have emphasized the limitations of ectothermy by concentrating on small organisms, or ones inhabiting xeric environments. To investigate the potential plasticity of ectotherm behaviour in a benign environment, aspects of the behaviour and ecology of two species of tortoise (Testudinidae) were examined in a rain forest in north-western Brazil.
   2 Activity levels were monitored by a mark-recapture study and movements were examined by radiotracking and trailing several individuals simultaneously. Fifty-six tortoises were followed over the 18-month study (1442 tortoise-days).
   3 Most of the variation observed in activity levels, movement behaviour and use of area was explained at the level of individuals. The few patterns observed seemed related to reproductive biology: young individuals and adult females were active all year round, while large males were active almost exclusively during the mating season. However, except for male Geochelone carbonaria (Spix) during the mating season, individual behaviour patterns differed markedly within each species, sex and season group.
   4 We argue that the low metabolic requirements of adult tortoises, along with their low vulnerability to predation and existence in a benign environ-ment, allow individuals

AB  - The role of red-footed tortoises (Geochelone carbonaria) and yellow-footed tortoises (G. denticulata) as seed dispersal agents was investigated in northwestern Brazil from 5 to 26 January 2002 by analyzing fecal samples for frequency and viability of seed species and estimating daily displacement of tortoises from recaptured and thread-trailed individuals. Fourteen of 19 fecal samples contained a total of 646 seeds represented by 11 plant species. The most abundant species was Ficus sp. (N = 400) with 100 percent of seeds viable, followed by Aechmea sp. (N = 88) with 93 percent of seeds viable, and Genipa americana (N = 59) with 91 percent of seeds viable. Mean minimum retention time of seeds was 1.6 d and mean daily displacement of tortoises based on recaptured (N = 7) and thread-trailed tortoises (N = 2) was 57 m. Thus, the diversity and proportion of viable seeds consumed by tortoises, combined with the seed retention times and daily movements, suggest they may be effective dispersal agents. These preliminary findings warrant further investigation into the ecological role of these tortoises in Neotropical ecosystems and their contribution to the maintenance of species diversity and forest structure.

AB  - The tick Amblyomma humerale Koch is endemic to South America. All host records refer to the adult stage parasitizing tortoises, mostly yellow-footed tortoise, Geochelone denticulata (L.), and red-footed tortoise, Geochelone carbonaria (Spix). The current study reports the presence of A. humerale in the state of Rondonia, Brazil. A total of 215 adult ticks (201 males, 14 females) was collected from six G. denticulata in an Indian reserve and nine Geochelone sp. in rural Monte Negro County, giving an overall mean infestation of 14.3 +/- 12.0 (range: 2-44) ticks per tortoise. Male ticks always outnumbered females on the host and nine tortoises had only male ticks. Male ticks were mostly attached in clusters on the ventral sides of the carapace near the anterior and posterior margins, and more rarely on the outer margin of the plastron. All females were found attached to the tortoise skin, at different sites such as head, neck, shoulders or legs. Male ticks were rarely observed attached to the body skin. Seven engorged nymphs collected on small vertebrates from Monte Negro County molted to adults of A. humerale. This included one nymph each on the seven-colored lizard, Plica plica (L.), green tree climber, Plica umbra (L.), and wide-foraging lizard, Kentropyx calcarata Spix, three nymphs on the common opossum, Didelphis marsupialis L., and one nymph on the silky anteater, Cyclopes didactylus L. These constitute the first host records for the immature stages of the tick A. humerale.

AB  - The extinction of frugivores has been considered one of the main drivers of the disruption of important ecological processes, such as seed dispersal. Many defaunated forests are too small to restore function by reintroducing large frugivores, such as tapirs or Ateline monkeys, and the long-term fate of large-seeded plants in these areas is uncertain. However, such small fragments still host many species and play relevant ecosystem services. Here, we explore the use of two tortoise species, the red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonarius) and the yellow-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis denticulatus), as ecological substitutes for locally extinct large seed dispersers in small forest patches in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We employed prior knowledge on the known occurrences of Chelonoidis species and used ecological niche modeling (ENM) to identify forest patches for tortoise rewilding. Based on habitat suitability, food availability and conservation co-benefits, we further refined our analysis and identified that the more suitable areas for tortoise reintroduction are forest patches of northern Atlantic Forest, areas with high defaunation intensity. Giant tortoises have been used to restore lost ecological services in island ecosystems. We argue that reintroducing relatively smaller tortoises is an easy-to-use/control conservation measure that could be employed to partially substitute the seed dispersal services of extinct large disperser species, mitigating the negative cascading effects of defaunation on reducing plant diversity.

AB  - PurposeThe aim of this study was to establish normal ophthalmic parameters for select diagnostic tests in red-footed tortoises (Chelonoides carbonaria). A total of 52 animals, approximately 20-30years old, were studied.
   MethodOphthalmic diagnostic tests included culturing of the normal conjunctival bacterial flora in summer and winter, evaluation of tear production using Schirmer tear test (STT) and endodontic absorbent paper point tear test in two different environmental temperatures (EAPPTT-1 at 32 degrees C and EAPPTT-2 at 18 degrees C), cytology of conjunctival cells, B-mode ultrasonography, measurement of palpebral fissure length (PFL), and applanation tonometry (in two different positions).
   ResultsIn both seasons, Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Median (+/- IQR/2) STT was 12.0 +/- 3.5mm/min, EAPPTT-1 was 15.9 +/- 0.7mm/15s, and EAPPTT-2 was 15.4 +/- 0.4mm/min (OD) and 17.8 +/- 1.0mm/min (OS). Anterior chamber depth was 1.0 +/- 0.1mm, lens axial length was 2.3 +/- 0.1mm, vitreous chamber depth was 4.3 +/- 0.2mm, and axial globe length was 7.7 +/- 0.3mm. PFL was 11.7 +/- 1.7mm. Intraocular pressure was 11.5 +/- 2.8mmHg for males and 14.0 +/- 3.5mmHg for females (dorsoventral position) and 18.0 +/- 3.2mmHg for males and 24.1 +/- 3.0mmHg for females (ventrodorsal position with inclination of 45 degrees). The ophthalmic parameters reported here can aid in the diagnosis of eye diseases in red-footed tortoises (Chelonoides carbonaria).

AB  - In order to help elucidate the evolution of alpha-globins, the complete cDNA and amino acid sequences of Geochelone carbonaria and Geochelone denticulata land turtles alpha-D chains have been described. In G. carbonaria, the cDNA is 539 bp with ATG start codon located at position 46, TGA stop codon at position 469 and AATAAA polyadenylation signal at position 520. In G. denticulata, the cDNA is 536 bp with ATG start codon located at position 46, TGA stop codon at position 469 and AATAAA polyadenylation signal at position 517. Both cDNAs codify 141 amino acid residues, differing from each other in only four amino acid residues. When comparing with human Hb alpha-chain, alterations in important regions can be noted: alpha110 Ala-Gly, alpha114 Pro-Gly, alpha117 Phe-Tyr and alpha122 His-Gln. There is a high homology between the amino acids of these turtles when compared with chicken alpha-D chains, progressively decreasing when compared with human, crocodile, snake, frog and fish alpha-chains. Phylogenetic analysis of alpha-D chains shows that those of turtles are closer to those of birds than to snakes and lizards. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Thiol groups of hemoglobin and blood glutathione are higher in Geochelone carbonaria than in Geochelone denticulata. Exposure of stripped hemolysate of both tortoises to terc-butyl hydroperoxide, resulted in a higher ferroheme oxidation of G. denticulata hemoglobin. In this example glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase, were not active due to the absence of GSH and NADPH, suggesting that the thiol groups of G. carbonaria hemoglobin act as antioxidant, similar to GSH. In the total hemolysate, however, where the antioxidant enzymes are active, both species showed similar levels of hemoglobin oxidation, suggesting that the protective effect of thiol groups of hemoglobin are less effective for heme protection. The activity of glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase was higher in erythrocytes of G. denticulata and the activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase was higher in erythrocytes of G. carbonaria.

AB  - The cDNA sequence encoding the turtle Geochelone carbonaria beta-chain was determinated. The isolation of hemoglobin mRNA was based on degenerate primers' PCR in combination with 5'- and 3'-RACE protocol. The full length cDNA is 615 bp with the ATG start codon at position 53 and TGA stop codon at position 495; The AATAAA polyadenylation signal is found at position 599. The deduced polypeptyde contains 146 amino-acid residues. The predicted amino acid sequence shares 83% identity with the beta-globin of a related specie, the aquatic turtle C. p. belli. Otherwise, identity is higher when compared with chicken beta-Hb (80%) than with other reptilian orders (Squamata, 69%, and Crocodilia, 61%). Compared with human HbA, there is 67% identity, and at least three amino acid substitutions could be of some functional significance (Glu43 beta-->Ser, His 116 beta--> Thr and His143 beta-->Leu). To our knowledge this represents the first cDNA sequence of a reptile globin gene described.

AB  - The oxygen-binding properties of hemoglobin (Hb) from the adult terrestrial turtle Geochelone carbonaria are described. Turtle hemoglobins have a low intrinsic oxygen affinity and a low sensitivity to an endogenous cofactor (ATP) usually present at high concentrations in the reptile erythrocytes. The amplitude of the Bohr effect for O-2 binding was virtually the same in the absence and presence of saturating ATP concentrations (Delta logP(50)/Delta pH, about -0.60) and increased in the total hemolysate (-0.83). The large Bohr effect found in G. carbonaria Hb may be important for O-2 delivery to the tissue. The degree of cooperativity displayed by Hb for O-2 binding ranged between 1.5 and 2.0 in stripped solution and total hemolysate. These observations suggest the stability of the low affinity conformation, which needs to be confirmed by additional experiments.

AB  - Sulfhydryl groups are important to avoid oxidative damage to the cell. In RBC, tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tert-BOOH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are capable of oxidizing heme and promoting lipid peroxidation. H2O2 caused greater oxidation of heme than tert-BOOH, although the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups was similar. Geochelone carbonaria Hb, a rich sulfhydryl protein, inhibited the TBA-reactive substances formation of human erythrocytes exposed to tert-BOOH by about 30%; this decrease was smaller with Geochelone denticulata Hb. Sulfhydryl reagents diminished the number of reactive sulfhydryl groups in the G. carbonaria Hb resulting in a decrease of its antioxidant power, suggesting the involvement of sulfhydryls of Hb in the protection against lipid peroxidation.

AB  - Objective. Evaluate different venipuncture points and the use of two anticoagulants to obtain blood samples in turtles. Materials and methods. Eighty-two turtles of the species Trachemys callirostris, Podocnemis unifilis and Chelonoidis carbonaria were sampled. Three venipuncture points were evaluated: subcarapacial venous sinus, dorsal coccygeal vein, and jugular vein. Two anticoagulants were tested: sodium heparin and EDTA. Results. The jugular vein was the best place to practice venipuncture as the blood samples obtained were free of hemodilution and enough volume to carry out a blood profile. In contrast, samples from the other venipuncture points were usually hemodiluted. Blood samples from C. carbonaria stored with EDTA (40 mu l/ml of blood) showed haemolisis, which was not observed using sodium heparin (100 UI/ml of blood) as anticoagulant. Conclusions. The jugular vein is the most recommended venipuncture site for the extraction of blood samples for clinical purposes. Sodium heparin was the best anticoagulant to store blood samples due to the fact that it does not induce haemolisis in any sample.

AB  - The contractions of Chelonoidis carbonaria aortic rings induced by electrical field stimulation (EFS) are not inhibited by blockade of the voltage-gated sodium channels by tetrodotoxin but almost abolished by the alpha 1/alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine. The objective of this study was to identify the mediator(s) responsible for the EFS-induced contractions of Chelonoidis carbonaria aortic rings. Each ring was suspended between two wire hooks and mounted in isolated 10 ml organ chambers filled with oxygenated and heated Krebs-Henseleit's solution. Dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations were analysed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The contractions caused by dopamine and EFS were done in absence and presence of the nitric oxide (NO) synthesis inhibitor L-NAME, the NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ, the D1-like receptor antagonist SCH-23390, the D2-like receptor antagonists risperidone, quetiapine, haloperidol, and the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitors salsolinol and 3-iodo-L-tyrosine. Basal concentrations of dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline were detected in Krebs-Henseleit solution containing the aortic rings. The catecholamine concentrations were significantly reduced in endothelium-denuded aortic rings. L-NAME and ODQ significantly potentiated the dopamine-induced contractions. The D2-like receptor antagonists inhibited the EFS-induced contractions of the aortic rings treated with L-NAME, whereas SCH 23390 had no effect. Similar results were observed in the contractions induced by dopamine in L-NAME treated aortic rings. These results indicate that catecholamines released by endothelium regulate the EFS-induced contractions. This may constitute a suitable mechanism by which reptilia modulate specific organ blood flow distribution.

AB  - We developed and optimized a simple, efficient and inexpensive method for in vitro culture of peripheral blood lymphocytes from the Brazilian tortoise Chelonoidis carbonaria (Testudinidae), testing various parameters, including culture medium, mitogen concentration, mitotic index, culture volume, incubation time, and mitotic arrest. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from the costal vein of four couples. The conditions that gave a good mitotic index were lymphocytes cultured at 37 degrees C in minimum essential medium (7.5 mL), with phytohemagglutinin as a mitogen (0.375 mL), plus streptomycin/penicillin (0.1 mL), and an incubation period of 72 h. Mitotic arrest was induced by 2-h exposure to colchicine (0.1 mL), 70 h after establishing the culture. After mitotic arrest, the cells were hypotonized with 0.075 M KCl for 2 h and fixed with methanol/acetic acid (3: 1). The non-banded mitotic chromosomes were visualized by Giemsa staining. The diploid chromosome number of C. carbonaria was found to be 52 in females and males, and sex chromosomes were not observed. We were able to culture peripheral blood lymphocytes of a Brazilian tortoise in vitro, for the preparation of mitotic chromosomes.

AB  - In this study, we associated imaging modalities, such as computed tomography (CT) and standard radiography, with anatomical specimens to describe the anatomy of the appendicular skeleton of red-footed tortoises (Chelonoidis carbonaria), using animals of different sizes, ages, sexes and weights. Manus and pes bones were described from conventional radiography and osteological specimens, because they have small structures that could not be reconstructed. The main anatomical feature that differentiates C. carbonaria from others Testudines is the ischial-pubic tuberculum. The pectoral girdle is formed by the union of two bones, the scapula and the coracoid, showing no bone connection with the shell. Carpal and tarsal bones can be fused or not and include: carporadial and central carpus, carpoulnar and V carpal, central tarsal and fibular tarsal, distal tarsal I and II. The phalangeal formula is 2:2:2:2:2 in the forelimb and 2:2:2:2:1 in the hind limb. Imaging examinations are important tools in anatomical description and can be used in living individuals, replacing or aiding the study with anatomical specimens.

AB  - Chelonoidis carbonaria aortic rings present endothelium-derived release of dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline and 6-nitrodopamine (6-ND). Here it was investigated whether 6-ND release is coupled to nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and its action on the vascular smooth muscle reactivity.
   Basal release of 6-ND from aortic rings in the absence and presence of the NO synthesis inhibitor L-NAME was quantified by LC-MS-MS. Aortic rings were suspended vertically between two metal hooks in 10-mL organ baths containing Krebs-Henseleit's solution and attached to isometric transducers. The tissues were allowed to equilibrate for 1 h before starting the experiments.
   The release of 6-ND was significantly reduced by previous incubation with L-NAME. 6-ND (up to 300 mu M) had no contractile activity in the aortic rings. 6-ND (1, 3 and 10 mu M) produced significant rightward shifts of the concentration-response curves to dopamine in endothelium-intact (pA(2) 6.09) and L-NAME pre-treated endothelium-intact (pA(2) 7.06) aortic rings. Contractions induced by noradrenaline and adrenaline were not affected by pre-incubation with 6-ND. The EFS (16 Hz)-induced aortic contractions were significantly inhibited by incubation with 6-ND (10 mu M).
   In the thromboxane A(2) mimetic U-46619 (30 nM) pre-contracted endothelium intact aortic rings, 6-ND (1 nM-1 mu M) and the dopamine D-2-receptor antagonist haloperidol (1 nM-1 mu M) induced concentration-dependent relaxations. The relaxations were not present in endothelium-removed aortic rings but they were not affected by incubation with L-NAME in endothelium-intact aortic rings.
   The results indicate that the synthesis of this novel catecholamine in Chelonoidis carbonaria aortic rings is coupled to NO release and that 6-ND acts as a highly selective dopamine D-2-like receptor antagonist.

AB  - In this study the nitric oxide (NO)-soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) pathway was characterized in tortoise Chelonoidis carbonaria aorta. Concentration response curves (CCR) to ATP, ADP, AMP, adenosine and histamine were performed in the presence and absence of L-NAME in aorta pre-contracted with ACh (3 mu M). CCR to SNP, BAY 41-2272 (sGC stimulator), BAY 60-2770 (sGC activator) and tadalafil (PDE-5 inhibitor) were constructed in the presence and absence of ODQ (10 mu M). ATP (pEC(50) 6.1 +/- 0.1), ADP (PECso 6.0 +/- 0.2), AMP (pEC(50) 6.8 +/- 0.1) and histamine (pEC(50) 6.8 +/- 0.12) relaxed Chelonoidis aorta and the addition of L-NAME reduced their efficacy (p < .05). Adenosine effects (pEC(50) 6.6 +/- 0.1) were not changed in the presence of L-NAME. SNP (pEC(50) 7.5 +/- 0.7; Emax 102.2 +/- 2.5%), BAY 41-2272 (pEC(50) 7.3 +/- 0.2; Emax 130.3 +/- 10.2%), BAY 60-2770 (pEC(50) 11.4 +/- 0.1; Emax 130.3 +/- 6.5%) and tadalafil (pEC(50) 6.7 +/- 0.3; Emax 121.3 +/- 15.3%) relaxed Chelonoidis aorta. The addition of ODQ reduced the SNP and tadalafil maximum response (p < .05) and promoted 63 fold right shift on BAY 41-2272 curve. In contrast, no alteration was observed on BAY 60-2770 response. Transcriptomic analysis for eNOS and sGC were found in aorta and brain libraries with high homology when compared with human transcripts. The NO-sGC-PDE-5 is functionally present in Chelonoidis aorta with a functional and genomic similarity to mammalian vessels. Unlike most of mammalian vessels, ACh did not cause endothelium-dependent relaxation in Chelonoidis carbonaria aortic rings.

AB  - Chapiniella variabilis (Chapin, 1924), a strongylid nematode, was collected parasitizing the large intestine of the tortoises Chelonoidis carbonarius (Spix, 1824) (Cc) and C. denticulatus (Linnaeus, 1766) (Cd) in the Zoobotanical Park of the municipality of Teresina, state of Piaui, Brazil. The taxonomic identification was based on morphological and morphometric features, using bright-field and scanning electron microscopy. The present study adds new observations on the morphology, mainly relating to the mouth papillae, external and internal leaf-crown elements, excretory pore, deirids and male and female posterior end. The parasitic indices of prevalence (P), mean intensity (MI), mean abundance (MA) and range of infection (RI) of C. variabilis in these two tortoise species were: P = 100%, MI = 833.3, MA = 833.3, RI = 500-1,500 (Cc); P = 100%, MI = 472.2, MA = 472.2, RI = 333-500 (Cd). This record expands occurrences of C. variabilis to a new host, C. carbonarius, and to another state in Brazil, in the Neotropical region of South America. Adjustment to host management with the aim of improving hygiene and health conditions is suggested.

AB  - Respiratory tract diseases of various origins are commonly diagnosed in captive testudines. In tortoises, computed tomography is considered the method of choice for evaluation of the lung. Our objective was to describe the anatomy of the lung parenchyma of red-footed tortoises (Chelonoidis carbonaria) using cornputed tomography to estimate the normal radiodensity of the lung and lung volume. We selected 10 healthy adult red-footed tortoises of similar size. Computed tomography images were obtained using lung window settings and multiplanar reconstructions for quantitative evaluation using the histogram method. The tortoises were not sedated and were allowed to maintain their head and limbs retracted during the exam. Data were expressed in mean and standard deviation. In testudines, the lung is divided into left and right, and there are no lobes. There is a main bronchus in each lung. Mean values for radiodensity and lung volume were -811.30 +/- 19.82 Hounsfield units and 942.12 +/- 189.29 cm(3), respectively. These findings can be useful as a normal range for evaluating red-footed tortoises in a clinical setting. It also serves as a basis for future studies regarding specific patterns in lung disease.

AB  - The sedative effects of intranasal midazolam and dexmedetomidine were evaluated in 2 tortoise species as a means to facilitate handling and performing diagnostic procedures. Six red-footed tortoises (Chelonoidis carbonaria) and 6 Indian star tortoises (Geochelone platynota) received the following treatments in a randomized order with 2-week washout periods between the treatments: midazolam (0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg), dexmedetomidine (0.05 and 0.15 mg/kg), and saline control. Tortoises were evaluated and scored for sedation (using a previously published subjective method) by blinded observers, and results were averaged for each species and treatment group. Low-dose dextnedetomidine (0.05 mg/kg) in red-footed tortoises resulted in a significantly higher median sedation score at 5 minutes compared with other treatments. Control saline resulted in a higher median sedation score 5 minutes after administration in Indian star tortoises compared with red-footed tortoises. No other significant differences were observed between treatments or between species. The results suggest that intranasal administration of midazolam or dexmedetomidine, at the dosages used in this study, do not provide effective sedation in red-footed tortoises or Indian star tortoises, based on a subjective scoring system.

AB  - The reaction of thiol reagents with G. carbonaria hemoglobin was studied, and the oxygen equilibrium and kinetic of oxidation of derivatives determined. The oxygen affinity and kinetic of oxidation of hemoglobin derivatives were modified to various extents depending on the nature of thiol reagents used. Diamide yielded approximately 80% polymeric hemoglobin, although the oxidation kinetic, and the functional properties, were practically invariant (T-1/2 =10.0 min.; P50 = 5.0 mm Hg at pH 7.4; alkaline Bohr effect = -0.64). Iodoacetamide did not modify the electrophoretic pattern significantly, although all the free SH groups of hemoglobin were alkylated. A P50 of 2.5 mmHg at pH 7.4 and the Bohr effect of -0.15 were obtained; the T-1/2 Of about 6.4 min. was shorter than that for un-modified Hb. Similar T-1/2 were obtained for Hb treated with oxidized glutathione, which produced polymeric Hb and glutathionyl-Hb. The oxygen binding characteristics showed that both of Hb derivatives, glutathionyl-Hb and polymeric Hb, maintain the capacity to transport the gas.

AB  - Background: Reference hematological values for chelonians are uncommon, especially those that take account of seasonal variations. While there exists controversy over how climate influences hematological values in different reptile species, the identification of this influence would help with the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of diseases that affect these species, often kept as pets. Chelonians are ectotherms and, therefore, intrinsic and extrinsic factors may affect physiological and hematological values, affecting the interpretation of clinical information on these species. The aims of this study were to assess the hematological values of captive red-footed tortoises (Chelonoidis carbonaria) and to check their variation according to the cold and warmer seasons of the year.
   Materials, Methods & Results: Blood samples were collected from nine red-footed tortoises (C. carbonaria) of indeterminate sex and different ages, bred in captivity without control over environmental variables during one year, one each season (summer, fall, winter and spring). A total of 36 samples were considered to study. The colder seasons were collapsed together into one group that holds winter and fall (colds) and the months whit warmer weather spring and summer were grouped as a class called (warm). The complete blood count was performed manually, and medians, maximum values, and minimum values were obtained from the animals in each season of the year. The samples were grouped in "cold" and "warm" classes as above. Repeated measures ANOVA were used in order to compare the influence of climate variation on hematologic variables. For this mater Bonferroni's test was employed as post-hoc analysis. As results, the erythrocytes total count, hemoglobin value, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, absolute numbers of heterophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, and total plasma proteins varied significantly (P < 0.05) between colder and warmer seasons. Erythrocyte values yielded significantly higher values in warmer seasons than in the other seasons. The seasonality was verified in erythrocytes total count (P < 0.001), hemoglobin value (P < 0.001), hematocrit values (P < 0.001) and differential white blood cell count (P < 0.001).
   Discussion: The hematological alterations detected in C. carbonaria were similar observed in similar studies in reptiles species and due to the distinct method and management used and different species, it was not possible to compare the statistical results. In previously studies, as a C. carbonaria, the hematological variations between climatic seasons were identified in other reptile species due particular ectothermic metabolism. The variation in total WBC count produced by seasons of the year had already been described in snakes, such as in South American rattlesnakes and in tropical snakes. Changes in metabolic activity may be influence in TPP values in reptiles when season of the year is included as a variable. In hibernating species, the variation in TPP values is attributed to hibernating behavior when the lower food intake led to a decrease in plasma protein levels. In the case of C. carbonaria, which does not hibernate, other variables could influence the difference between seasons. All hematological changes observed in studied animals confirm the influence of climate between cold and hot months, given the peculiar metabolism of chelonians. The results point out the importance is to consider the seasonal climate variations in the interpretation of hematological values of C. carbonaria under uncontrolled environmental conditions.

AB  - The hematology of wild and captive animals is essential for obtaining details about species and represents a simple method of diagnosing disease and determining prognosis. Few studies have described the morphology of chelonian blood cells, which are more common in sea and freshwater turtle species. Thus, in order to further our understanding and recognition of different chelonian cells types, the present study aimed to describe blood cells from the two species of Brazilian tortoises, Chelonoidis carbonarius and C. denticulatus. Cytochemical analysis of tortoise blood tissue with Panotico, made it possible to describe all the of the chelonian cell types (with the exception of thrombocytes): erythrocytes, agranular leukocytes (monocytes and lymphocytes), and granular leukocytes (eosinophils, heterophils, basophils, and azurophils). These data are of high importance for establishing hematological profiles of Brazilian tortoises and reptiles. Therefore, based on our results and on comparative analyses with data from the literature for other reptile species, we can conclude that the blood cells described for Brazilian tortoises are found in all species of reptiles that have been analyzed thus far, and may be characterized and used as a comparative parameter between different groups to evaluate the health status of these animals.

AB  - In this study, the development and validation of a method for quantification of 6-nitrodopamine in Krebs-Henseleit's solution by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with positive ion electrospray ionization is described. Aortic rings taken from tortoise were either denuded or left with endothelium intact (15 mm, N = 6) and were incubated for 30 min in 5 mL Krebs-Henseleit's solution in an organ bath. Solid phase extraction (SPE) was performed for aliquots of 1 mL of the supernatant. The separation of 6-nitrodopamine was obtained on a 150 mm x 3 mm Shim-pack GIST-HP C18 column, using 75% of mobile phase A consisted of deionized water with 0.1% formic acid (v/v) and 25% of mobile phase B consisted of acetonitrile/deionized water (50/50, v/v) + 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 350 mu L/min in an isocratic mode. The method was linear over the concentration range of 0.1-20 ng/mL. The method was sensitive, precise and accurate for the assessment of the basal release of 6-nitrodopamine from Chelonoidis carbonaria aortae in vitro. The mean +/- SEM concentrations of 6-nitrodopamine released from endothelium-intact and endothelium-denuded aortae were 0.44 +/- 0.06 ng/mL and 0.18 +/- 0.05 ng/mL, respectively. These results indicate that tortoise's aortae display a basal endothelium-derived 6-nitrodopamine release.

AB  - The horizontal-vertical illusion is a size illusion in which two same-sized objects appear to be different if presented on a horizontal or vertical plane, with the vertical one appearing longer. This illusion represents one of the main evidences of the anisotropy of the perceived space of humans, an asymmetrical perception of the object size presented in the vertical and horizontal space. Although this illusion has been widely investigated in humans, there is an almost complete lack of studies in non-human animals. Here we investigated whether reptiles perceive the horizontal-vertical illusion. We tested two reptile species: bearded dragons (Pogona vitticeps) and red-footed tortoises (Chelonoidis carbonaria). In control trials, two different-sized food strips were presented and animals were expected to choose the longer one. In test trials, animals received two same-sized strips, presented in a spatial arrangement eliciting the illusion. Only bearded dragons significantly preferred the longer strip in control trials; in test trials, bearded dragons selected the strip arranged vertically, suggesting a human-like perception of this pattern, while no clear choice for either array was observed in tortoises. Our results raise the interesting possibility that the anisotropy of perceived space can exists also in a reptile brain.

AB  - Using sequence data of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, we investigated phylogeographic differentiation of the Amazonian tortoise species Chelonoidis carbonaria and C. denticulata. While C. carbonaria is generally restricted to savannah habitats and adjacent forests, C. denticulata is associated with wet tropical and subtropical forests. Our study suggests a correlation between distinct habitat preferences and phylogeography of the two species. In Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analyses, haplotypes of C. carbonaria cluster in several distinct clades reflecting the species' patchy distribution in savannah habitats. By contrast, haplotypes of C. denticulata are only weakly differentiated; a finding also confirmed by parsimony network analysis. This suggests that the contiguous Amazonian rainforest allows gene flow between populations of the forest-dwelling C. denticulata throughout the range, but significantly impedes gene flow in C. carbonaria. The phylogeographic structure and extant distribution pattern of C. carbonaria is supportive of former Amazonian rainforest fragmentation, enabling the dispersal of savannah species. Based on fossil calibration, we dated divergence times for the C. carbonaria clades using a relaxed molecular clock, resulting in average estimates ranging from 4.0-2.2 mya. This implies that the onset of rainforest fragmentation could predate the Pleistocene considerably. Furthermore, our findings call for further research on geographic and taxonomic variation in C. carbonaria and for a reassessment of the conservation status of the distinct genetic units.

AB  - Introduction of exotic ticks and pathogens through international animal trade (farm animals and pets) is a serious threat to public health and local fauna. Rapid and correct identification of potential threats is an important step on the way to conduct an efficient control of imported pests. In this report we describe the molecular identification of the neotropic tick Amblyomma rotundatum intercepted from red-footed tortoise (Chelonoides carbonaria), imported to Israel from Florida, USA. Molecular analysis of the ticks conducted upon their identification, revealed that they were infected with Rickettsia bellii. Following their collection, the ticks were examined morphologically and five molecular markers were used to determine their taxonomic identity: cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COX1), cytochrome b (CytB), 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA and internal transcribed sequence 2 (ITS-2). Molecular analysis indicated that all of the collected ticks were Amblyomma rotundatum. Using rickettsial gltA (citrate synthase) gene in real-time PCR analysis we found that approximately 25% of the intercepted ticks (8 of 33) were infected with Rickettsia bellii. It is concluded that accurate and timely identification of imported exotic ticks prevented their introduction to Israel, and that use of molecular tools may further improve the response to such potential threats.

AB  - Tetrasporocystic, dizoic oocysts of reptiles have been separated by some authors into the genera Eimeria, Choleoeimeria and Acroeimeria (Protozoa: Eimeriidae), based on the site and mode of development of their endogenous stages. The majority of Eimeria species have been, and still are, however, described on cocyst morphology alone. Four different oocysts with this basic morphology were encountered in the faeces of Brazilian tortoises, Geochelone carbonaria Spix, 1824 and are assigned to the genus Eimeria, with the view that they can readily be transferred to the genus Choleoeimeria or Acroeimeria if this is indicated by a future examination of their endogenous development. A morphological comparison distinguishes the oocysts from those of Eimeria spp., previously described in chelonids of the family Testudinidae, and the names F. amazonensis, F. carbonaria, E. carajasensis and E. wellcomei n. spp. ore proposed. Coccidial infection appears to be common in G. carbonaria, with three of seven animals examined passing oocysts. Oocysts of Isospora rodriguesae n. sp. (Protozoa: Eimeriidae) are described in the faeces of Geochelone denticulata Linnaeus, 1766. They are morphologically very different from those of Isospora testudae, Davronov, 1985 in Testudo horsfieldi. Eimeria motelo Hurkova et al., 2000, previously described in Geochelone denticulata from Peru, is here recorded in the some chelonid from Amazonion Brazil.

AB  - In the last few decades, there has been a global increase in the adoption of reptiles as companion animals, mainly turtles and ('onsidering the popularity of reptiles as pets in Brazil, and a notable lack of data about potentially pathogenic staphylococci in these animals, this study isolated and evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility of staphylococcal species from healthy tortoises (Chelonoidis carbonaria) in Brazil. During a 12-month period (February 2019 to February 2020), cloacal swabs from 66 healthy tortoises were collected at the Wild Animals Screening Center in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The swabs were plated onto mannitol salt agar for staphylococci isolation, and species identification was performed using MALDI-TOF MS. Antimicrobial susceptibility was investigated using the disk diffusion method, and the presence of the mecA gene was investigated by PCR to detect methicillin resistance. Of the tested animals, 72.7% were positive for staphylococcal isolation. All isolates were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), and Staphylococcus sciuri (81.3%), and S. xylosus (12.5%) were the most frequently isolated species. The majority of the isolates (56%) were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent. A high frequency of resistance was observed for penicillin (35.5%) and tetracycline (29.1 N. All strains were susceptible to cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, and gentamicin. All isolates were negative for the mecA gene. The present work suggests that healthy tortoises are mainly colonized by CoNS, especially S. sciuri. Half of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial, raising questions regarding the possible role of these animals as reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance genes.

AB  - The diagnosis of several diseases in chelonians is a challenge in the veterinary clinic, because a detailed physical examination with auscultation and palpation is difficult due the presence of carapace and plastron. Imaging analysis such as radiography and computed tomography (CT) have been shown to be beneficial for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment in numerous animal species. Thus, this study aimed to identify and describe the structures of the lower respiratory tract in red-foot tortoises, by computed tomography, radiography and gross anatomy in twelve red-foot tortoises (Chelonoidis carbonaria), adults and of both sexes. The lower respiratory tract in these animals comprised the larynx, trachea, bronchi and the lungs. The presence of epiglottic cartilage was not observed in the animals studied. CT allowed the observation of the intrapulmonary part of the bronchi, which was accompanied by large intrapulmonary blood vessels. The lungs presented a reticulated parenchyma, without lobulations. Each lung had a small chamber located near the cranial and caudal poles. These structures were identified in CT and 3D CT reconstructions and these could suggest that these chambers could be non-respiratory structures, and could be comparable to the air sacs of birds. This study establishes normal CT anatomy of the lower respiratory tract of the red-foot tortoise; and may be used as a reference in the assessment of respiratory disorders in this tortoise.

AB  - Animal personality, the consistent between-individual differences in e.g., risk-taking, exploration, antipredator or mating behaviours, has major impacts on the fitness of individuals in many species. Understanding how to quantify animal personality should help us predicting how species interact with their environment and with the current environmental changes. We adapted existing behavioural assays to quantify the personality of two Brazilian tortoises, Chelonoidis carbonarius and C. denticulatus. We recorded behavioural responses to stress, novel environments, novel objects and social encounters. Behavioural components were consistent through time, supporting the existence of personality in both species. These behaviours were further correlated and could be summarized into two behavioural axes with recognizable biological meanings. One axis was related to responses to threats and novelty, as well as interest and interaction behaviours towards conspecifics and one to submission. The behavioural dimensions were similar in both species, suggesting that they share the same behavioural syndromes, but C. carbonarius had greater frequency of risk taking behaviours. This pattern can be related to differences in resource availabilities and predator pressures in their respective natural habitats. Within each species, however, the individual variation in morphology only had a weak effect on personality and males tended to show more signs of submission. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of habitat features (resource availabilities and predation risk) on individual behavioural variation in each species in order to improve conservation and translocations programs.

AB  - Visual illusions have been widely used as a tool to study animal visual perception. In many cases, identical experimental procedures were adopted to make highly controlled interspecific comparisons. However, reducing methodological variability may prevent reliable comparisons because a certain methodology could be more suitable for some species than others. This study sought to build on previous work that investigated the perception of the Delboeuf illusion in reptiles. Reptiles were presented with trials composed of 2 different-sized food portions on 2 identical plates in which they were expected to maximize their food intake. In contrast to the bearded dragons (Pogona vitticeps), tortoises (Chelonoidis carbonaria) performed poorly in all conditions and therefore no firm conclusion regarding their perception of the illusion could be made. Such results could be due to cognitive challenges or due to the experimental setup. because descending a ramp is demanding for the tortoises. In this study. we adopted the same experimental paradigm but in a flat apparatus. Tortoises significantly discriminated the larger food portions in baseline trials, however, their performance did not differ from chance in illusory trials revealing that, under these conditions, they are not sensitive to the Delboeuf illusion. This nonperception could be ascribed to different factors, such as poorer discrimination ability or a low sensitivity to contrast and assimilation phenomena. Our study highlights the importance of additional investigation to better understand the nature of null results, taking in consideration the ecological needs of the species before drawing any conclusions about its abilities.

AB  - The effects of temperature on breathing pattern and oxygen consumption are being investigated in juvenile tortoises and compared to adults, in order to understand physiological adjustments of the respiratory system as related to body size, especially regarding the energetic expenditure associated with growth. We analyzed the breathing pattern and oxygen consumption of juvenile and adult red-footed tortoises (Chelonoidis carbonarius, Cryptodira: Testudinidae). The animals (N = 9; body mass ranging from 0.03 Kg to 2.5 Kg) were exposed to normoxic-normocarbic conditions using open respirometry in order to determine the breathing pattern and oxygen consumption in three different temperatures (15, 25, 35 degrees C). The obtained results showed intermittent breathing pattern in all tested temperatures in juveniles and adults. Tidal volume was not affected by changes in temperature, while breathing frequency increased significantly with increasing temperature, leading to a sig-nificant increment in minute ventilation between 15 and 35 degrees C. Mass specific oxygen consumption increased significantly with temperature and juveniles showed greater values when compared to adults. The alterations in the ventilatory response to temperature changes occurred in order to maintain the oxygen supply with increased metabolic activity. The differences between juveniles and adults in breathing frequency lead to juveniles needing a lower ventilation rate to perform gas exchange while extracting more oxygen. While these differences might be attributed to a greater metabolic expenditure during development, scaling effects on respiratory variables might be the main contributors to the found differences.

AB  - Background: The growing contact between men and wild animals, caused by the increase in the population in urban centers and the destruction of the habitat of these animals, has been leading to a greater circulation of pathogens between humans and wildlife. Chelonoidis carbonaria, a tortoise found throughout South America, is one of the animals most rescued from animal trafficking and illegal breeding. Considering this situation, this study aimed to verify the occurrence of hemoparasites in C. carbonaria.Materials and Methods: Blood samples from 73 C. carbonaria were collected from animals located in (1) a rural commercial breeding unit, (2) an urban zoo, and (3) a center of rescued animal screening. Genomic DNA was extracted from these animals and used in PCRs to detect specific genomic fragments of haemogregarines (i.e., Hepatozoon and Hemolivia), and members of the Anaplasmataceae Family (i.e., Ehrlichia sp. and Anaplasma sp.). Blood samples were screened for hemopathogens by direct microscopy and were used for hematological assays, and serum samples were analyzed to determine the concentration of serum components.Results: It was found that 34.2% of the tortoises presented Sauroplasma sp. in their blood samples; these animals showed clinical biochemistry changes that indicate altered liver function. Two zoo animals were positive for Ehrlichia sp. in PCR, and also presented clinical biochemistry and hematological changes.Conclusion: The present project is pioneer in the detection of Ehrlichia sp. in C. carbonaria, and was able to identify changes in clinical biochemistry that can be a result of the infection by hemopathogens in this species.

AB  - OBJECTIVE
   To evaluate the effects of a dexmedetomidine-midazolam-ketamine (DMK) combination administered IM to captive red-footed tortoises (Chelonoidis carbonaria).
   ANIMALS
   12 healthy adult red-footed tortoises.
   PROCEDURES
   In a prospective experimental study, DMK (0.1, 1.0, and 10 mg/kg, respectively) was administered IM as separate injections into the right antebrachium. Atipamezole (0.5 mg/kg, IM) and flumazenil (0.05 mg/kg, SC) were administered into the left antebrachium 60 minutes later. Times to the first treatment response and maximal treatment effect after DMK administration and time to recovery after reversal agent administration were recorded. Vital signs and reflexes or responses to stimuli were assessed and recorded at predetermined intervals.
   RESULTS
   DMK treatment produced deep sedation or light anesthesia for = 20 minutes in all tortoises. Induction and recovery were rapid, with no complications noted. Median times to first response, maximum effect, and recovery were 4.5, 35, and 14.5 minutes, respectively. Two tortoises required additional reversal agent administration but recovered < 20 minutes after the repeated injections. Mean heart and respiratory rates decreased significantly over time. All animals lost muscle tone in the neck and limbs from 35 to 55 minutes after DMK injection, but other variables including palpebral reflexes, responses to mild noxious stimuli (eg, toe pinching, tail pinching, and saline ([ 0.9 NaCl] solution injection), and ability to intubate were inconsistent.
   CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
   DMK administration produced deep sedation or light anesthesia with no adverse effects in healthy adult red-footed tortoises. At the doses administered, deep surgical anesthesia was not consistently achieved. Anesthetic depth must be carefully evaluated before performing painful procedures in red-footed tortoises with this DMK protocol.

AB  - Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) have been reported as causes of morbidity and mortality in free-living animal populations, including turtles and tortoises, and they have even resulted in species extinctions, with human activities contributing to the spread of many of these diseases. In the Galapagos, giant tortoises are endangered due to habitat change, invasive species, and other human impacts; however, the impact of EIDs on Galapagos tortoise conservation remains understudied. To fill this gap, we conducted health assessments of five tortoise species from the islands of Santa Cruz, Isabela and Espanola. We performed health evaluations of 454 animals and PCR testing for pathogens known to be relevant in other tortoise species. We identified two novel sequences of adenoviruses and four of herpesviruses. Based on alignments of the DNA polymerase gene and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses, we found both novel adenoviruses to be most closely related to red footed tortoise adenovirus 2, by nucleotide sequence and red footed tortoise adenovirus 1, based on amino acid sequence. Three of the herpesvirus sequences translated into the same deduced amino acid sequence; therefore, they may be considered the same viral species, closely related to terrapene herpesvirus 2. The fourth herpesvirus sequence was highly divergent from any sequence previously detected and is related to an eagle owl herpesvirus based on nucleotide sequence and to loggerhead oro-cutaneous herpesvirus based on amino acids. These novel viruses may be pathogenic for giant tortoises under specific conditions (e.g., stress). Continued screening is crucial to determine if these viruses play a role in tortoise fitness, morbidity and survival. This information allows us to provide recommendations to the Galapagos National Park Directorate and other institutions to improve the management of these unique species both in Galapagos and globally, and for tortoise reintroduction plans throughout the archipelago.

AB  - The role of endothelium in the electrical-field stimulation (EFS)-induced contractions of Chelonoidis carbonaria aorta was investigated. Contractions were evaluated in the presence and absence of L-NAME (100 mu M), tetrodotoxin (1 mu M), phentolamine (10 and 100 mu M), phenoxybenzamine (1 and 10 mu M), prazosin (100 mu M), idazoxan (100 mu M), atropine (10 mu M), D-tubocurarine (10 mu M) or indomethacin (10 mu M). EFS-induced contraction was also carried out in endothelium-denuded rings. EFS-induced contraction was investigated by the sandwich assay. Concentration curves to endothelin-1 (0.1-100 nM) and U46619 (0.001-100 mu M) were also constructed to calculate both Emax and EC50. EFS at 16 Hz contracted Chelonoidis aorta, which was almost abolished by the endothelium removal. The addition of L-NAME increased the EFS response (2.0 +/- 0.4 and 8.3 +/- 1.9 mN). In L-NAME treated aortic rings, tetrodotoxin did not change the EFS-response (5.1 +/- 1.8 and 4.9 +/- 1.7 mN). Indomethacin, atropine and d-tubucurarine also did not affect the EFS-response. Phentolamine at 10 mu M did not change the EFS-induced contraction; however, at 100 mu M, reduced it (3.9 +/- 1 and 1.9 +/- 0.3 mN). Prazosin and idazoxan did not change EFS-induced contractions. Phenoxybenzamine at 1 reduced by 76% (9.6 +/- 3.4 and 2.3 +/- 0.8 mN) and at 10 mu M by 90% the EFS response. Immunohistochemistry identified tyrosine hydroxylase in the endothelium and brain, whereas S100 protein was found only in brain. In conclusion, endothelium modulates EFS-induced contractions in Chelonoidis aortic rings and this modulation may be due to endothelium-derived catecholamines, possibly dopamine.

AB  - Background: The anatomical, physiological, and pharmacological characteristics of reptiles make anesthesia in chelonians particularly challenging. Specific literature regarding safe anesthetic protocols that provide immobilization, antinociception, amnesia, and unconsciousness are scarce. Thus, this paper aims to report the case of a red-footed tortoise submitted to long-duration general anesthesia to celiotomy for foreign body removal.
   Case: An adult red-footed tortoise (Chelonoides carbonaria), 5.9 kg, was admitted due to hyporexia after ingesting a metallic fishhook. Serial radiographs confirmed the diagnosis and location of the foreign body in the stomach. The animal was premedicated with 0.03 mg/kg dexmedetomidine, 6 mg/kg ketamine, and 0.4 mg/kg butorphanol intramuscularly. After 90 min we inserted a 22G jugular catheter and proceeded to anesthesia induction with 5 mg/kg propofol. We in tubated the animal with a 2.5 nun uncuffed endoiracheal and started fluid therapy at a rate of 5 mL/kg/h. Surgical anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in 0.21 oxygen, in a non-rebreathing circuit (baraka), under spontaneous breathing. Expired isoflurane was maintained between 3 and 4.5%. Due to reduced respiratory rate and hypercapnia, we opted for implementing manually-assisted positive pressure ventilation. Morphine (0.5 mg/kg) was administered at 10 and 87 min after the beginning of the surgery for further analgesia when the isoflurane requirement increased significantly. We did not detect any alterations in heart and body temperature. Surgical anesthesia lasted 6 h. During anesthesia recovery, voluntary head retraction and coordinated movement of the limbs occurred at 240 and 540 min after the extubation, respectively. In 2 days, the patient returned to voluntary feeding, being very active and responsive to stimulus. The post-surgical hematologic evaluation was unremarkable.
   Discussion: Pre-anesthetic medication aimed to promote sedation and preemptive analgesia. Due to its minimal cardiorespiratory depression, we chose the combination of ketamine, dexmedetomidine, and butorphanol. Dexmedetomidine reduced the ketamine dose and caused sufficient muscle relaxation and immobilization to perform the jugular catheter placement. Butorphanol is an agonist-antagonist opioid; that is why we decided to add it to the protocol for antinociception. However, due to signs of nociceptive response (increased isoflurane requirements and heart rate), and considering the evidence of a predominance of p receptors in reptiles, we administered low-dose morphine twice during the procedure. Propofol was chosen as an induction agent at a dose sufficient to allow endotracheal intubation. Since reptilians often show apnea in the presence of 100% oxygen, we used a 0.21 oxygen fraction. Despite this, the patient showed respiratory depression. Due to right to left cardiac shunt, sudden changes in the direction of the blood can lead to very rapid changes in the serum concentrations of isoflurane, which leads to frequent oscillations in the anesthetic depth and consequently the need for vaporizer adjustments, which may justify the high expired isoflurane fraction during the procedure. Despite that, physiological parameters were maintained within normal ranges for the species, with slight variations during the surgical procedure. We conclude that the proposed anesthetic protocol is safe for long-duration anesthesia in chelonians, ensuring cardiovascular and respiratory stability. Thus, this report may help veterinarians to perform safe anesthesia in tortoises submitted to invasive surgical procedures.

TI  - Use of Cost-effective Vacuum-assisted Closure Technique for Shell Fracture Repair and Coelomic Cavity Rupture Healing in a Chelonia carbonaria

AB  - Background: The vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy system has been used as a noninvasive wound management technique for shell damage in Chelonians. These animals are excellent candidates for VAC therapy because of their unique shell anatomy consists of dermal bones, which make bandage placement easier. Beyond that, they are suited for this technique behaviorally, because they are not inclined to remove the vacuum system intentionally. Considering the possibility of Testudines shell repair with the use of less invasive techniques, that result no additional dermal bone lesions, the objective of the present study is to describe the adaptation of a vacuum dressing protocol using low-cost and easily accessible materials for post-traumatic shell healing of a specimen of Chelonoidis carbonaria.
   Case: A specimen of tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonaria), a male, weighing 630 g, approximately 3-year-old, was received at the Veterinary Hospital - Wild Animals Sector in the Federal University of Para (UFPA) after of being run over by a vehicle. On physical examination, fractures of the dermal plaques and underlying bone structures were found, with rupture of the coelomic cavity. In addition, there was exposure and incarceration of an intestinal loop, with the presence of bleeding. According to the findings of the physical screening examination, the patient's prognosis was defined as good, as described in the literature that specifically focused on chelonian shell injuries. The animal was sent to the diagnostic imaging sector. Then, drug therapy was provided for pain control, vitamins were administered for nutritional support, and antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs were instituted. For the closure of the shell and coelomic cavity, a bandage was used with the VAC therapy system adapted as described for Chelonians in previous reports. After a complete osteosynthesis and closure of the coelomic cavity, repair of the integumentary component of the shell was possible. For this procedure, the animal did not need to be anesthetized. The patient was physically restrained by being placed in suspension on a support with a diameter smaller than the plastron. Complete asepsis of the shell was necessary. On top of the lesion, a polypropylene mesh and color less dental resin were applied. The animal continued to be evaluated after the repair to check for potential complications. This procedure ensured that the repaired plates remained stable. Furthermore, the animal did not seem to have any discomfort with the resin when moving, so the animal was discharged after 25 days of hospitalization.
   Discussion: Radiography was important to determine the condition of the animal and clinical prognosis, and thus, to perform the proper treatment. The VAC therapy system was successful in assisting the patient's recovery. It enabled the reduction of the healing time since shell injuries usually require four to eighteen months to heal. In this report, the healing process only required 17 days, demonstrating that the VAC therapy system is a beneficial treatment to treat traumatic injuries in Testudines. The restoration protocol of the integumentary component using dental resin is less invasive, and this type of material has been used previously by other authors. Drug treatment with aminoglycosides and sulphonamides administered prophylactically has proven to be effective and has been used successfully in reptiles. These drugs may be combined with maintenance fluid therapy to prevent adverse reactions from aminoglycosides, such as nephrotoxicity. It was concluded that the use of the VAC therapy system reduced the time of post-traumatic healing of the carapace and proved to be an innovative approach to treat traumatic injuries in Testudines in a less invasive way.

AB  - We have previously shown that olfactory bulbectomy causes a decrease in some metabolic parameters of chelonians. In the present study we evaluate the capacity for water retention of normal land tortoises and of tortoises with long-standing olfactory bulbectomy. Adult male Geochelone carbonaria tortoises were divided into three groups: group B, 11 tortoises submitted to olfactory bulbectomy two years prior to the study; group PB, 7 tortoises submitted to pseudobulbectomy two years before the study; group N, 9 intact animals. The animals were maintained in captivity in an outdoor area and submitted to the present study under semi-laboratory conditions involving an 18-day period with no solid or liquid food followed by 4 days of free water ingestion and a subsequent 17-day period of no solid or liquid food ingestion. Before water was offered, mean body weight (+/- SEM) was 1764 +/- 93.5 g for group B, 1801.4 +/- 137.4 g for group PB, and 2077.8 +/- 288.8 g for group N. Animal weight was recorded again on the 2nd and 4th days of water ingestion and on the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 10th, 12th, 14th and 17th days of fasting. Since no differences were detected between PB and N animals at any time, the data for the two groups were pooled. Thus a control group (C) of 16 animals was used for statistical comparison. The data reflect three behavioral situations: 1) water ingestion and urine excretion, 2) no water ingestion and urine excretion, and 3) neither water ingestion nor urine excretion. Body weight increased by 7.7 +/- 0.6% in group B and by 7.5 +/- 0.6% in group C on the 4th day of water drinking. Group C returned to its initial weight on the 14th day of fasting, whereas this occurred only on the 17th day in group B. In situation 2 (fasting with urine excretion), the bulbectomized group presented a significantly lower body weight loss compared to control. We conclude that these animals have a great capacity for water retention which is increased by olfactory bulbectomy.

AB  - Multi-faceted field sampling in a mosaic landscape in Venezuela generated insights on how topographical characteristics, forest composition, degree of habitat interspersion, and paleoecology influenced the abundance and distribution of vertebrates. Physical heterogeneity resulted in distinct vegetation types and a very uneven distribution of medium to large-sized vertebrates. Variations in forest composition resulted in dramatic contrasts in primate densities. White-tailed deer densities varied an order of magnitude between vegetation types. Yellow-knobbed curassow densities peaked in moist forest. Similar chachalaca densities were encountered in dry forest. Although there was spatial overlap between jaguars and pumas, from a large-scale perspective pumas made more use of drier habitats. In select habitats the abundance and biomass of red-footed tortoises exceeded that of multiple species of large native mammals combined. This variation in animal abundance highlights the significance of scale in the interpretation of ecological data.

AB  - In order to assess the efficacy of reinforcement as a conservation tool for rehabilitated elongated tortoises Indotestudo elongata (Blyth, 1854) we released 10 adults equipped with radio tracking transmitters to the Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary in northern Cambodia. Based on short-term success indicators for reintroduction studies on reptiles we studied the tortoises' adaptation to the new environment for five months. The tortoises successfully settled in the new environment without showing adverse effects regarding their behaviour, condition index (CI) and physical appearance. The annual survival rate was 76%. Based on individual locations collected, we analysed the tortoises' movement patterns including daily displacement, five-month and seasonal home range sizes using minimum convex polygons (MCPs) and fixed kernel density estimators (KDEs).

Blood was collected to prepare blood smears, without the use of anticoagulants. The slides were stained and analyzed microscopically to describe the cell morphology. The mature erythrocytes had an ellipsoid shape and a grain-free nucleus; immature ones were circular. The leukocytes, granulocytes and agranulocytes were also circular. The heterophils had cytoplasmic granules with various elongated shapes, and the eosinophils had a uniform round shape. The basophils had highly dense basophilic granules, stained in blue; the granules were irregularly arranged and also inside the nucleus. The lymphocytes were circular with a large circular nucleus. The thrombocytes were small, with basophilic staining and a small cytoplasm (the nucleus occupied almost the entire cell). The morphological results found in this study are consistent with cell types of other chelonians.

AB  - Although reptiles have traditionally been viewed as asocial, the recent discovery of complex social systems in lizards suggests that an animal's social behaviour may be shaped by its interactions with conspecifics early in life, as occurs in endothermic vertebrates. We reared hatchling veiled chameleons, Chamaeleo calyptratus, either in isolation or in groups of four, using a split-clutch design. Social interactions during the first 2 months of life substantially affected a chameleon's subsequent responses to newly encountered conspecifics in standardized trials: animals reared in isolation were more submissive, and adopted darker and duller colours. Isolation-reared lizards also performed less well in a foraging task. Thus, social isolation early in life can impair the development of squamate reptiles, as it does in mammals and birds.

AB  - We conducted a population genetic analysis of the two Amazonian tortoises, Chelonoidis denticulata (n = 40) and Chelonoidis carbonaria (n = 39) in a region of sympatry within the Xingu River basin. High levels of gene flow among sampled localities indicated lack of population structure for both species. Genetic parameters indicated a moderate level of genetic diversity in C. denticulata and neutrality tests suggested that populations of this species were in demographic equilibrium with respect to mitochondrial DNA. On the other hand, C. carbonaria presented low levels of genetic diversity and a signal of population expansion. Most records of C. denticulata are from areas of humid forest while those for C carbonaria are from areas of semi-deciduous forests and transitional areas between humid and semi-deciduous forests. Therefore, the demographic expansion observed in C carbonaria population could reflect an increase in the availability of suitable habitats for this species due to anthropogenic or natural processes. Additionally, we observed haplotype sharing between these two tortoise species indicating hybridization or incomplete lineage sorting.

AB  - Herbivorous vertebrates of and regions are frequently faced with inadequate food quality, quantity or both. The time and energy devoted to foraging is vital to balancing their energy budgets. For desert ectotherms, a low metabolism should be advantageous, reducing their total energy requirement, but extreme ambient temperatures can strongly constrain these animals' activity periods. We provide the first data on the activity budgets, foraging behaviour and diet of a highly abundant, desert-dwelling, herbivorous ectotherm, the steppe tortoise Testudo horsfieldi. Extreme climatic conditions of Central Asia limit steppe tortoise's activity to only three months per year. They remain inactive most of their "active season" (90%), and spend very little time foraging (< 15 min per day). This suggests that steppe tortoises can satisfy their energy requirements with modest feeding efforts. Interestingly, steppe tortoises avoid feeding on grass species and feed mostly on plant species that are usually highly toxic to mammals. This result suggests that steppe tortoises and ungulates do not compete for food.

AB  - Inhalant anesthesia is challenging in chelonians due to a great capacity for breath-holding and an incomplete separation of the cardiac ventricle. Deoxygenated blood can recirculate back into systemic circulation by bypassing the lung in a process referred to as intracardiac right to left (R-L) shunting. Via electrocardiogram gated magnetic resonance imaging, a novel modality to investigate arterial flows in reptiles, intracardiac shunting and its elimination via atropine during gas anesthesia in tortoises (Chelonoidis carbonaria) was demonstrated. The great vessels of the heart were visualized confirming that after shunt-elimination, the flow (mean +/- sd) in the pulmonary arteries increased significantly (54.6 +/- 9.5 mLmin(-1) kg(-1) vs 10.8 +/- 3.4 mLmin(-1) kg(-1); P < 0.008). Consequently, animals required significantly lower concentrations of inhaled anesthetics to maintain a stable anesthesia. To that end, the minimum anesthetic concentration (MAC) of isoflurane needed to maintain surgical anesthesia was measured. A significantly lower MAC was found after administration of atropine (mean MAC +/- sd 2.2 +/- 0.3% vs 3.2 +/- 0.4%; P < 0.002). Previously, MAC has been indeterminable in chelonians likely due to intracardiac shunting, so this report constitutes the first MAC study performed in a tortoise.

AB  - The genus of land tortoises Chelonoidis had a wide distribution across the Caribbean and Bahamian Archipelago during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. Two extinct species of this genus, C. marcanoi Turvey et al., 2017 and C. dominicensis Albury et al., 2018 were recently described from fossils collected in deposits in the southwest and east of the Dominican Republic respectively. Here we review the taxonomic status of Chelonoidis species from Hispaniola based on previously described remains along with new specimens recently collected. More diagnostic elements collected from cave deposits in the southwest Dominican Republic indicate that C. marcanoi is a senior synonym of C. dominicensis. This species was distributed across the south of eastern Hispaniola, including the Northern and Southeast Paleo-island. The new collection of fossils from the Pedernales rigion also includes associated elements of an undescribed species, Chelonoidis gersoni sp. nov., closely related to C. cubensis and C. marcanoi. The triangular-shaped gular projection of the epiplastron of this new species of Chelonoidis is unique among tortoises of this genus.

AB  - From September 2008 to March 2010, 397 ticks (315 larvae, 33 nymphs, 23 females, and 26 males) were collected from captive and free-living wildlife species in northeastern Brazil. Six tick species were identified, including Amblyomma auricularium (Conil) on Tamandua tetradactyla (L.),Amblyomma dubitalum Neumann on Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris (L.), Nectomys rattus (Pelzen) and T. tetradactyla, Amblyomma parvim A ragao on T. tatradactyla, Amblyomma rotundatum Koch on Boa constrictor L., Chelonoidis carbonaria (Spix), Kinosternon scorpioides (L.) and Rhinella jimi (Stevaux), Amblyomma cerium Koch on Bradypus variegatus Schinz, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Latreille) on Lycalopex vetulus (Lund). Nectomys rattus and T. tetradactyla are new hosts for A. dubitatum This study extends the known distribution of A. dubitatum in South America and provides evidence that its geographical range has been underestimated because of the lack of research. Four (A. dubitatum, A. parvum, A. rotundatum, and R. sanguineus) of six tick species identified in this study have previously been found on humans in South America, some of them being potentially involved in the transmission of pathogens of zoonotic concern.

AB  - Chelonoidis Dcarbonaria and C. denticulata are two tortoises which are widely distributed Brazil. Although they occur sympatrically in different areas, C. carbonaria prefers open areas, while C. denticulata chooses forest areas. Significant morphological variations can be observed in these species due to the fact that they occupy a vast and environmentally diverse area. Data on shell shape of captive individuals reveal important differences between the two species, mainly in the plastron scutes, carapace width, and head length. Variation in shape is greater in C. carbonaria than in C. denticulata, which may be associated to a more elaborate and complex mating ritual. The shell shape in C. denticulata is more elongated than in C. carbonaria due to ecological habits. These aspects lead to a greater restriction in shape, limiting variation and dimorphism. In C. carbonaria, the shell opening is larger than in C. denticulata, which affords greater variation in shape. A more elongated shell facilitates movements of C. denticulata in densely forested areas. Yet, this characteristic reduces shell opening, lessening the possibilities of variation in form.

AB  - The tickAmblyomma humeraleis endemic to South America, where its adult stage has been reportedmostly from terrestrial tortoises, whereas larvae and nymphs have been reported on various species of reptiles, birds, and mammals. Herein, we evaluated for the first time the life cycle ofA. humeralein the laboratory. For this purpose, larvae and nymphs were exposed to feed on six host species:Gallus gallus, Mesocricetus auratus, Calomys callosus, Chelonoidis carbonaria, Salvator merianae, andTrachemys scripta. Adult ticks were exposed to feed onT. scripta. The life-cycle ofA. humeralein the laboratory could be completed in an average period of ca. 200 days, considering prefeeding periods of 25 days for each of the parasitic stages. One bird species (G. gallus), one small mammal (C. callosus) and one reptile species (C. carbonaria) were the most suitable hosts for larvae; however, chickens (G. gallus) were the most suitable host for nymphs, whereas a turtle species (T. scripta) was highly suitable for adult ticks. These results corroborate field observations that indicated that the immature stages ofA. humeralehave a low host specificity, being able to feed successfully on reptiles, birds, and mammals, whereas reptiles are important hosts for the adult stage.

AB  - The first report of complete nucleotide sequences for alpha- and beta-globin chains from the Siamese hemoglobin (Crocodylus siamensis) is given in this study. The cDNAs encoding alpha- and beta-globins were cloned by RT-PCR using the degenerate primers and by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends method. The full-length alpha-globin cDNA contains an open reading frame of 423 nucleotides encoding 141 amino acid residues, whereas the beta-globin cDNA contains an open reading frame of 438 nucleotides encoding 146 amino acid residues. The authenticity of both alpha- and beta-globin cDNA clones were also confirmed by the heterologous expression in Escherichia coli (E. coli). This is the first time that the recombinant C. siamensis globins were produced in prokaryotic system. Additionally, the heme group was inserted into the recombinant proteins and purified heme-bound proteins were performed by affinity chromatography using Co2+-charged Talon resins. The heme-bound proteins appeared to have a maximum absorbance at 415 nm, indicated that the recombinant proteins bound to oxygen and formed active oxyhemoglobin (HbO(2)). The results indicated that recombinant C. siamensis globins were successfully expressed in prokaryotic system and possessed an activity as ligand binding protein.

AB  - Tears are an important component of the ocular surface protection mechanism and are in close contact with the corneal epithelium and the environment. Their composition is well-known in humans; however, there are few investigations on the composition and function of tears in reptiles, birds and others mammals, which would elucidate the mechanisms governing the maintenance of ocular homeostasis. In this work, electrophoretic profiles and an evaluation of total protein, albumin, urea, glucose, and cholesterol concentrations in tears of semi-aquatic, terrestrial, and marine reptiles (Caiman latirostris, Chelonia mydas, Caretta caretta, Eretmochelys imbricata, Lepidochelys olivacea, and Chelonoidis carbonaria), birds (Tyto furcata, Rupornis magnirostris and Ara ararauna), and mammals (Equus caballus and Canis lupus familiaris) were apresented. Human tear components and respective blood serum samples were used as references. The electrophoretic analysis revealed similarities whithin same Classes. The results of the tear-blood serum relationship and the comparison to human tear components showed particularities that are potentially derived from a homeostatic response to the environment. When the tear compositions of animals belonging to different ecological clusters were compared, marked differences were observed in total protein and urea concentrations. Thus, reptile, bird, and mammalian tears are complex fluids with differing concentrations of biochemical components that are potentially a result of the animals' adaptation to different environments.

AB  - Long-term memory can be adaptive as it allows animals to retain information that is crucial for survival, such as the appearance and location of key resources. This is generally examined by comparing choices of stimuli that have value to the animal with those that do not; however, in nature choices are rarely so clear cut. Animals are able to assess the relative value of a resource via direct comparison, but it remains unclear whether they are able to retain this information for a biologically meaningful amount of time. To test this, captive red-footed tortoises (Chelonoidis carbonaria) were first trained to associate visual cues with specific qualities and quantities of food, and their preferences for the different reward values determined. They were then retested after an interval of 18 months. We found that the tortoises were able to retain the information they had learned about the cues as indicators of relative reward values over this interval, demonstrating a memory for the relative quantity and quality of food over an extended period of time. This is likely to impact directly on an animal's foraging decisions, such as the exploitation of seasonally varying resources, with obvious fitness implications for the individual; however, the implications may also extend to the ecological interactions in which the animal is involved, affecting processes such as herbivory and seed dispersal.

AB  - Knowledge of host associations of blood-feeding vectors may afford insights into managing disease systems and protecting public health. However, the ability of methods to distinguish bloodmeal sources varies widely. We used two methods-Sanger sequencing and amplicon deep sequencing-to target a 228 bp region of the vertebrate Cytochrome b gene and determine hosts fed upon by triatomines (n = 115) collected primarily in Texas, USA. Direct Sanger sequencing of PCR amplicons was successful for 36 samples (31%). Sanger sequencing revealed 15 distinct host species, which included humans, domestic animals (Canis lupus familiaris, Ovis aries, Gallus gallus, Bos taurus, Felis catus, and Capra hircus), wildlife (Rattus rattus, Incilius nebulifer, Sciurus carolinensis, Sciurus niger, and Odocoileus virginianus), and captive animals (Panthera tigris, Colobus spp., and Chelonoidis carbonaria). Samples sequenced by the Sanger method were also subjected to Illumina MiSeq amplicon deep sequencing. The amplicon deep sequencing results (average of 302,080 usable reads per sample) replicated the host community revealed using Sanger sequencing, and detected additional hosts in five triatomines (13.9%), including two additional blood sources (Procyon lotor and Bassariscus astutus). Up to four bloodmeal sources were detected in a single triatomine (I. nebulifer, Homo sapiens, C. lupus familiaris, and S. carolinensis). Enhanced understanding of vector-host-parasite networks may allow for integrated vector management programs focusing on highly-utilized and highly-infected host species.

AB  - The reptile Iguana iguana exhibits four states of vigilance: active wakefulness (AW), quiet wakefulness (QW), quiet sleep (QS) and active sleep (AS). Cerebral activity decreases in amplitude and frequency when passing from wakefulness to QS. Both parameters show a slight increase during AS. Heart rate is at a maximum during AW (43.8 +/- 7.9 beats/min), decreases to a minimum in QS (25.3 +/- 3.2 beats/min) and increases in AS (36.1 +/- 5.7 beats/min). Tonical and phasical muscular activity is present in wakefulness, decreases or disappears in QS and reappears in AS. Single or conjugate ocular movements are observed during wakefulness, then disappear in QS and abruptly reappear in AS. Although these reptiles are polyphasic, their sleep shows a tendency to concentrate between 20:00 and 8:00 h. Quiet sleep occupies the greater percentage of the total sleep time. Active sleep episodes are of very short duration, showing an average of 21.5 +/- 4.9 (mean +/- SD). Compensatory increment of sleep following its total deprivation was significant only for QS. Reaction to stimuli decreased significantly when passing from wakefulness to sleep. It is suggested that the lizard I. iguana displays two sleep phases behaviorally and somatovegetatively similar to slow wave sleep and paradoxical sleep in birds and mammals. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Amebiasis is a parasitic infection caused by obligate or facultative amoeboid protozoans, as well as free-living forms. The genus Entamoeba includes both pathogenic and commensal species that can affect humans and animals. Entamoeba histolytica is the most important species associated with intestinal and extraintestinal infections in humans, while Entamoeba invadens is considered the most common and serious pathogen to many reptile species, including lizards, snakes and crocodilians. The aim of this manuscript is to report a case of amebiasis in a backyard red-foot tortoise in northeastern Brazil.
   Case: A 10-month-old male red-foot tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonaria) was presented at the Animal Pathology Laboratory of the Veterinary Hospital of Federal University of Campina Grande for necropsy with a 1-week history of anorexia, apathy, and reluctance to move. According to the owner, the animal suffered from heat stress in the backyard, where it was housed with another male red-foot tortoise. At post-mortem examination, there were approximately 1 mL of yellowish viscous transudate in the coelomic cavity. The liver was large, with rounded edges and multifocal to coalescing yellowish areas in the subcapsular surface. When cut, the parenchyma was more friable and yellowish. At the opening of the small intestine, the mucosa was thickened, reddened, and contained many variably sized, dark red ulcers with depressed and hemorrhagic centers. Histopathology of the liver reveals diffuse macro and microvacuolar degeneration of the hepatocyte cytoplasm, often displacing the nucleus peripherally (fatty degeneration). There were extensive and multifocal areas of necrosis characterized by shrunken, hypereosinophilic and pyknotic hepatocytes. Amebic trophozoites were seen through the areas of necrosis and degeneration and the morphological features were suggestive of the genus Entamoeba. In the portal triads and slightly extending to the sinusoidal spaces, there is a moderate inflammatory infiltrate of macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells and rare heterophils. There were amebic trophozoites and thrombi in hepatic vessels, and mild intracanalicular cholestasis. The small intestine contained areas of transmural necrosis and ulceration associated with inflammatory infiltrate of macrophages, lymphocytes and plasma cells. The ulcers were covered by a thick fibrinonecrotic exudate mixed with a varying number of heterophils and macrophages. The submucosa contained hemorrhage and edema. Similar amebic trophozoites were found within the mucosa and submucosa. and also detected in the lumens of blood vessels at the submucosa. The amebic trophozoites, seen in the liver and intestine. were intensely Periodic acid-Schiff positive.
   Discussion: The diagnosis of amebiasis was based on the epidemiological, clinical and anatomopathological findings. Amebiasis is a well-recognized disease that usually is diagnosed post-mortem in numerous species of reptiles. Unfortunately, there are no scientific articles describing these cases in Brazil. In reptiles, the major pathogenic specie is Entamoeba invadens, while several other species arc considered non-pathogenic, such as E. barreti, E. insolita, E. terrapinae, E. aenosaurae, and E. knowlesi, among others. Although cultivation of E. invadens was not undertaken, the anatomopathological findings and the morphological appearance of the agent is highly suggestive of infection with this organism. In conclusion, amebiasis is a severe infectious disease that can affect young red-footed tortoises under adverse environmental conditions. Clinical signs are nonspecific and may be difficult to identify. The diagnosis is usually made post-mortem by anatomopathological findings and the morphological appearance of the agent.

AB  - From 2005 to 2009, 147 ticks found on 32 wild animals from or referred to two zoobotanical parks (Parque ZoobotA cent nico Arruda CA cent mara and Parque Estadual Dois Irmos) located in northeastern Brazil were identified. Ticks found on two veterinarians working in one of the parks (i.e., Parque Estadual Dois Irmos), after return from forested areas within the park's territory, were also identified. The following tick-host associations were recorded: Amblyomma fuscum Neumann on Boa constrictor L.; Amblyomma longirostre Koch on Ramphastos vitellinus ariel Vigors and Coendou prehensilis (L.); Amblyomma varium Koch on Bradypus variegates Schinz; Amblyomma rotundatum Koch on Chelonoidis carbonaria (Spix), Chelonoidis denticulata (L.), Micrurus ibiboboca (Merrem), Python molurus bivittatus Kuhl, Iguana iguana (L.) and B. variegatus; Amblyomma nodosum Neumann on Myrmecophaga tridactyla L. and Tamandua tetradactyla (L.); and Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Latreille) on Nasua nasua (L.). The ticks found on the veterinarians were identified as nine Amblyomma larvae. The presence of Am. nodosum in Pernambuco and Am. rotundatum and Am. varium in Paraiba is recorded for the first time and the occurrence of Am. longirostre in Pernambuco is confirmed. Ramphastos vitellinus ariel is a new host record for Am. longirostre whereas M. ibiboboca and B. variegatus are new host records for Am. rotundatum. Finally, the human parasitism by Amblyomma ticks is reported for the first time in Pernambuco, highlighting the potential of tick-borne pathogen transmission in this state.

AB  - Terrestrial chelonians of arid regions are frequently faced with highly variable food quality and/or quantity and these problems could be aggravated in overgrazing areas. Then, it is crucial for species conservation to possess precise data on feeding ecology. In this paper, we provide the first quantitative data on Testudo graeca graeca feeding ecology, in the central Jbilets (Morocco). Diet composition was obtained by faecal analysis and compared to plant assemblages in the field. Interestingly, T. g. graeca seems rather a specialist herbivorous tortoise. The five main plant species found in faecal samples (Leontodon saxatilis (Asteraceae); Malva parviflora (Malvaceae); Astragalus cruciatus, Medicago hispida and Lotus arenarius (Fabaceae)) represent 70% of the identified material and are highly preferred whereas several other plant species, common in the field (e.g. Eryngium ilicifolium (Ombellifereae); Emex spinosus (Polygonaceae); Spergula flaccida Caryophyllaceae) are actively avoided. Fabaceae made up 27% of the diet and may be important forbs in the diet of terrestrial tortoise owing to their high nutritional value. The diet composition of T. g. graeca suggests that diet overlap may occur between domestic ungulates and tortoises in overgrazed landscape and could generate a competition context. However, T. g. graeca seems to focus its foraging effort under the spiny shrubs where the impact of overgrazing is strongly attenuated. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To compare tear electrolytes and tear crystallization patterns in birds and reptiles, tears were sampled by Schirmer tear test from 10 animals each ofAra ararauna, Amazona aestiva, Tyto alba, Rupornis magnirostris, Chelonoidis carbonaria, andCaiman latirostris, and 5 ofCaretta caretta. The aliquots were pooled to assess concentrations of total protein, chloride, phosphorus, iron, sodium, potassium, calcium, and urea. For the tear ferning test, samples of each species were observed under a polarized light microscope at room temperature and humidity. Crystallization patterns were graded according Rolando and Masmali scales. There was more total protein and urea in owl and sea turtle tears, respectively, than in the other animals tested. Electrolyte balance was similar for all species, with higher sodium, chloride, and iron. In birds, Rolando-scale grades of tear crystallization patterns ranged from I to II, and from 0 to 2 using the Masmali scale; in reptiles, grades were II to IV (Rolando) and 2 to 4 (Masmali). Crystallization arrangements of some species had higher scores, as caimans and sea turtles, possibly due to different the tear composition. Marine and lacustrine species presented higher. The ionic balance of lacrimal fluids of birds and reptiles was similar to that in humans, with higher values of sodium and chloride. However, a similar tear composition did not influence the crystal morphology. Crystallization classification suggested that higher grades and types are due to the different microelements present in the tears of wild species.

AB  - Wild fauna is of crucial importance in the social, economic and cultural construction of peasant communities, although its use can generate threats to the stability of the most exploited wild populations. This article determined from an ethnozoological point of view the uses received by wildlife in a rural town of Plato Magdalena. 70 structured interviews were carried out, using illustrated files of amphibian, reptile, bird, and mammal species with distribution for this region. 103 species were recognized (11 amphibians, 29 reptiles, 32 birds and 31 mammals), where 65% support different categories of use: food, trade, pet, handicrafts and medicine, uses that include 12 reptiles, 28 birds and 27 mammals. The species with the greatest use as food are Dasypus novemcinctus, Dasiprocta punctata, Hydrochoerus h. isthmius, Mazama sanctaemartae, Pecari tajacu, Sylvilagus floridanus, Trachemys callirostris, Iguana iguana, Ortalis garrula, Dendrocygna autumnalis. Commercial use falls on Caiman crocodilus fuscus, I. iguana, T. callirostris and Chelonoidis carbonarius; and as pets Ara araruana, A. macao, Eupsittula pertinax, Brotogeris jugularis, Amazona ochrocephala, Thraupis episcopus, Sicalis flaveola, Cebus versicolor, Notosciurus granatensis and C. carbonarius. The skins of Leopardus pardalis, Puma concolor, Panthera onca, C. crocodilus fuscus, Boa constrictor, and shells of C. carbonarius are used in crafts. Different species of birds, mammals and reptiles are important resources for the survival of the peasant community, whose utilitarian value is closely related to sociocultural aspects and traditional knowledge, which is important to take into account in the design of conservation programs.

AB  - Diet selection and optimization may be affected by nonadditive interactions (or associative effects) among ingested diet items. Associative effects occur when one diet item affects the digestion (either positively or negatively) of another diet item. Feeding trials were conducted with an opportunistic omnivore, the yellow-bellied slider turtle (Trachemys scripta scripta), on three diets: duckweed, insect larvae, and duckweed/larvae mix. Diet had a significant effect on digestibilities and intake, but not on transit time.
   There was a significant associative effect in the duckweed/larvae diet. For all diet components except lipids, the digestive efficiencies measured in the duckweed/larvae diet were significantly greater than those predicted from the digestive efficiencies for duckweed and larvae diets when fed alone. The presence of larvae in the digesta significantly improved the digestive processing of duckweed, probably by supporting greater numbers or diversity of cellulolytic microbes. A given mass of duckweed provided almost-equal-to 70% more energy and 20% more nitrogen to the turtle when ingested with insect larvae than when ingested alone.
   Associative effects should be incorporated in optimal foraging models and studies of diet selection because the value of a diet item can vary with the foods with which it is ingested. The assigned value must include not only the direct nutritional gain from the item, but also the indirect nutritional gain (or loss) through positive (or negative) effects on digestion of food items with which it is ingested.

AB  - In order to determine the main anatomopathological findings of Testudines necropsied in the Distrito Federal, all necropsy records performed at the "Laboratorio de Patologia Veterinaria" of the "Universidade de Brasilia" (LPV-UnB) on Testudines during the period from January 2008 to July 2020 were reviewed. The 72 cases reviewed were grouped and classified according to species, sex, origin, season of occurrence, and diagnosis. In 69.44% of the cases the species was informed in the necropsy protocols, which included Phrynops geoffroanus (38%), Trachemys dorbigni (36%), Chelonoidis carbonaria (14%), Chelonoidis denticulata (10%) and Podocnemis expansa (2%). In 30.55% of the cases this parameter was not informed and were classified only as Testudines. In 41.66% of the cases the sex was informed, being female 22.22%, male 19.44%, and 58.33% were not informed. Of these animals 79.16% were from environmental agencies and 20.84% from zoos and/or guardians. In 70.83% of the animals analyzed they were directly related to the autumn and winter seasons, with June being the most frequent month (29.17%). The conclusive diagnosis was possible in 68.05% of the cases. The category of disorders caused by injurious agents (48.97%) was the most prevalent, followed by inflammatory disorders (32.65%) and nutritional and metabolic disorders (28.57%). The main diagnoses were carapace and/or plastron fracture with 30.61%, hepatic steatosis (20.40%) and pneumonia (10.22%). Most cases of carapace or plastron fracture and hepatic steatosis occurred in animals from environmental agencies.

AB  - The number of people who raise reptiles as pets has increased, but information about zoonotic Campylobacter carried by reptiles is limited. A survey of zoonotic Campylobacter species isolated from reptiles was undertaken to understand the possibility of this zoonotic bacterial pathogen causing human infection. A total of 179 fresh reptile fecal samples were collected from human-raised, pet shop and wild reptiles to survey the Campylobacter species. Basic biochemical reactions and 16S rRNA gene sequencing were used to identify the Campylobacter species. In the 179 fecal samples, 6.7% (12/179) were Campylobacter positive; all positive samples were identified as Campylobacter fetus. For the different reptile species, the prevalence of C. fetus in turtles was 9.7% (10/103), 1.7% (1/56) in lizards and 5.0% (1/20) in snakes. Based on published C. fetus subspecies-specific sequences, 9 of the C fetus bacterial isolates were identified as C fetus subsp. fetus by multiplex PCR. In addition, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to analyze the Campylobacter epidemiology and population genetics. Most of the C fetus strains isolated from the reptiles were genetically distinct from classical mammalian C fetus. Only the new type of ST-43, isolated from Chelonoidis carbonaria (turtle), was closely related to mammalian strains. Strain Campy-pet-3 possesses a urease activity in this study is the first to be described in C fetus and this strain is the only one of lizard origin. This study provides the first information of Campylobacter species distribution in reptilian feces and supports the possibility of zoonotic Campylobacter infectious diseases caused by reptiles.

AB  - Testudines, also known as living fossils, have evolved diversely and comprise many species that occupy a variety of ecological niches. However, the immune adaptation of testudines to the different ecological niches remains poorly understood. This study compared the composition, function, and differentiation trajectories of peripheral immune cells in testudines (Chelonia mydas, Trachemys scripta elegans, Chelonoidis carbonaria, and Pelodiscus sinensis) from different habitats using the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technique. The results showed that T. scripta elegans, which inhabits freshwater and brackish environments, had the most complex composition of peripheral immune cells, with 11 distinct immune cell subsets identified in total. The sea turtle C. mydas, had the simplest composition of peripheral immune cells, with only 5 distinct immune cell clusters. Surprisingly, neither basophils were found in C. mydas nor T cells in C. carbonaria. Basophil subsets in peripheral blood were identified for the first time; two basophil subtypes (GATA2-high-basophils and GATA2-low-basophils) were observed in the peripheral blood of T. scripta elegans. In addition, ACKR4 cells, CD4 T cells, CD7 T cells, serotriflin cells, and ficolin cells were specifically identified in the peripheral blood of T. scripta elegans. Furthermore, LY6G6C cells, SPC24 cells, and NKT cells were specifically observed in C. carbonaria. Moreover, there were differences in the functional status and developmental trajectory of peripheral immune cells among the testudine species. The identification of specific features of peripheral immune cells in testudines from different habitats may enable elucidation of the adaptation mechanism of testudines to various ecological niches.

AB  - According to most studies on seed dispersal in tropical forests, mammals and birds are considered the main dispersal agents and the role played by other animal groups remains poorly explored. We investigate qualitative and quantitative components of the role played by the tortoise Chelonoidis denticulata in seed dispersal in southeastern Amazon, and the influence of seasonal variation in tortoise movement patterns on resulting seed shadows. Seed shadows produced by this tortoise were estimated by combining information on seed passage times through their digestive tract, which varied from 3 to 17 days, with a robust dataset on movements obtained from 18 adult C. denticulata monitored with radio transmitters and spoon-and-line tracking devices. A total of 4,206 seeds were found in 94 collected feces, belonging to 50 seed morphotypes of, at least, 25 plant genera. Very low rates of damage to the external structure of the ingested seeds were observed. Additionally, results of germination trials suggested that passage of seeds through C. denticulata's digestive tract does not seem to negatively affect seed germination. The estimated seed shadows are likely to contribute significantly to the dispersal of seeds away from parent plants. During the dry season seeds were dispersed, on average, 174.1 m away from the location of fruit ingestion; during the rainy season, this mean dispersal distance increased to 276.7 m. Our results suggest that C. denticulata plays an important role in seed dispersal in Amazonian forests and highlight the influence of seasonal changes in movements on the resulting seed shadows.

AB  - To prevent population extirpations, we need to understand a species' requirements, especially for critically endangered species inhabiting biodiversity hotspots. Studying animal movement provides necessary insights and gauges protected area effectiveness. Southeast Asian protected areas are becoming isolated, stressing the need for maintaining population viability. We used radio-telemetry with the critically endangered Elongated Tortoise (Indotestudo elongata) to assess: movements, space use, and conspecific overlap in a small protected area-Sakaerat Biosphere Reserve, Thailand. Movements were weakly seasonal, higher in hot and wet seasons than the dry season, and annual space use varied (4.24-55.57 ha), with conspecifics frequently overlapping. Conspecific comparisons revealed males (n = 5) moved similarly to females (n = 12) but used larger areas. Despite more instances of conspecific attraction over avoidance (20:8), avoidance/attraction behavior appeared disconnected from individual size; therefore, interaction patterns may result from resources locations (mates or food) rather than competition (i.e., no evidence of smaller individuals avoiding larger individuals). Female-female attraction suggests no resource exclusion tactics at our temporal resolution. Male-female attraction may indicate seasonal reproductive movements, but we could not detect significant interactive effects linking conspecific attraction or step length to breeding activity. Our observations of annual space use and overlap present critical components when designing robust population assessments underlining any successful I. elongata conservation effort. In the context of previous work connecting space overlap with population viability, our results suggest the biosphere population of I. elongata to be reproductive, with enough resources to be viable, emphasizing the importance of relatively small protected natural areas.

AB  - Prior work with chelonians has demonstrated their capacity for successful performance in cognitive tasks, including those requiring color discrimination. Here, we sought to expand on historical research and determine whether eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina) are capable of not only making simple color discriminations but also whether they can demonstrate abstract concept formation evidenced by using a relational response rule in their discrimination performance. Two eastern box turtles were rapidly and successfully trained on a black-and-white two-choice discrimination task using painted paddles and food reinforcement. After mastery, a medium gray paddle was added as a choice stimulus and turtle "Flippy" was reinforced for selecting the darker of the 2 stimuli presented in each trial, and turtle "Mario" was reinforced for selecting the lighter of the paddles presented. Nonreinforced probe trials incorporating light and dark gray stimuli paired with all other color options were then added to each session to test the turtles' ability to use the relationship between choice stimuli to guide responding. The turtles successfully selected the paddles corresponding to their assigned relational response rule of "darker" or "lighter" at a level significantly above that predicted by chance. The turtles then demonstrated immediate generalization of their relational rule in testing with a novel array of blue paddles. Finally, the turtles continued to use their relational rule when presented with a novel array of green paddles in a traditional transposition task. Together, these findings support the capacity for higher order cognitive functioning in chelonians beyond that previously described.

AB  - Background. Ventilatory parameters have been investigated in several species of Testudines, but few species have had their ventilatory pattern fully characterized by presenting all variables necessary to understand changes in breathing pattern seen under varying environmental conditions.
   Methods. We measured ventilation and gas exchange at 25 degrees C in the semi-aquatic turtle Trachemys scripta and the terrestrial tortoise Chelonoidis carbonarius under normoxia, hypoxia, and hypercarbia and furthermore compiled respiratory data of testudine species from the literature to analyze the relative changes in each variable.
   Results. During normoxia both species studied showed an episodic breathing pattern with two to three breaths per episode, but the non-ventilatory periods (T-NVP) were three to four times longer in T. scripta than in C. carbonarius. Hypoxia and hypercarbia significantly increased ventilation in both species and decreased T-NVP and oxygen consumption in T. scripta but not in C. carbonarius.
   Discussion. Contrary to expectations, the breathing pattern in C. carbonarius did show considerable non-ventilatory periods with more than one breath per breathing episode, and the breathing pattern in T. scripta was found to diverge significantly from predictions based on mechanical analyses of the respiratory system. A quantitative analysis of the literature showed that relative changes in the ventilatory patterns of chelonians in response to hypoxia and hyperbarbia were qualitatively similar among species, although there were variations in the magnitude of change.

AB  - Despite the ubiquitous nature of sleep, its functions remain a mystery. In an attempt to address this, many researchers have studied behavioural and electrophysiological phenomena associated with sleep in a diversity of animals. The great majority of vertebrates and invertebrates display a phase of immobility that could be considered as a sort of sleep. Terrestrial mammals and birds, both homeotherms, show two sleep states with distinct behavioural and electrophysiological features. However, whether these features have evolved independently in each clade or were inherited from a common ancestor remains unknown. Unfortunately, amphibians and reptiles, key taxa in understanding the evolution of sleep given their position at the base of the tetrapod and amniote tree, respectively, remain poorly studied in the context of sleep. This review presents an overview of what is known about sleep in amphibians and reptiles and uses the existing data to provide a preliminary analysis of the evolution of behavioural and electrophysiological features of sleep in amphibians and reptiles. We also discuss the problems associated with analysing existing data, as well as the difficulty in inferring homologies of sleep stages based on limited data in the context of an essentially mammalian-centric definition of sleep. Finally, we highlight the importance of developing comparative approaches to sleep research that may benefit from the great diversity of species with different ecologies and morphologies in order to understand the evolution and functions of sleep.

AB  - 6-Nitrodopamine (6-ND) is a novel catecholamine that is released from human umbilical cord vessels and Chelonoidis carbonaria aortic rings. The synthesis/release of 6-ND is inhibited by either pre-incubation of the vessels with the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor L-NAME or by mechanical removal of the endothelium. 6 -ND causes powerful vasorelaxation, acting as a potent and selective dopamine D2-like receptor antagonist.Basal release of 6-ND from Panterophis guttatus endothelium intact and denuded aortic rings was quantified by LC-MS/MS. In order to evaluate the interaction of 6-ND with other catecholamines, aortic rings were suspended vertically between two metal hooks in 10-mL organ baths containing Krebs-Henseleit's solution and attached to isometric transducers.Endothelium intact aortic rings presented basal release of 6-ND, which was significantly reduced by previous incubation with L-NAME (100 mu M). In endothelin-1 (3 nM) pre-contracted endothelium intact aortic rings, 6-ND (10pM-1 mu M) and the dopamine D2-receptor antagonist L-761,626 (10 pM-1 mu M) induced concentration -dependent relaxations, which were not affected by incubation with L-NAME but greatly reduced in endothelium-removed aortic rings.6-ND (0.1-1 mu M) produced significant rightward shifts of the concentration-response curves to dopamine in L -NAME pre-treated endothelium-intact (pA2 7.01) rings. Contractions induced by noradrenaline and adrenaline were not affected by pre-incubation with 6-ND (1 mu M). The EFS-induced contractions of L-NAME pre-treated endothelium-intact aortic rings were significantly inhibited by incubation with 6-ND (1 mu M).The results indicate that 6-ND released from Pantherophis guttatus aortic rings is coupled to NO release and represents a new mechanism by which NO can modulate vascular reactivity independently of cGMP production.

AB  - Starting in the late 1970s, ecologists began unraveling the role of recently extinct large vertebrates in evolutionary ecology and ecosystem dynamics. Three decades later, practitioners are now considering the role of ecological history in conservation practice, and some have called for restoring missing ecological functions and evolutionary potential using taxon substitutes - extant, functionally similar taxa - to replace extinct species. This pro-active approach to biodiversity conservation has proved controversial. Yet, rewilding with taxon substitutes, or ecological analogues, is now being integrated into conservation and restoration programmes around the world. Empirical evidence is emerging that illustrates how taxon substitutions can restore missing ecological functions and evolutionary potential. However, a major roadblock to a broader evaluation and application of taxon substitution is the lack of practical guidelines within which they should be conducted. While the International Union for Conservation of Nature's reintroduction guidelines are an obvious choice, they are unsuitable in their current form. We recommend necessary amendments to these guidelines to explicitly address taxon substitutions. A second impediment to empirical evaluations of rewilding with taxon substitutions is the sheer scale of some proposed projects; the majority involves large mammals over large areas. We present and discuss evidence that large and giant tortoises (family Testudinidae) are a useful model to rapidly provide empirical assessments of the use of taxon substitutes on a comparatively smaller scale. Worldwide, at least 36 species of large and giant tortoises went extinct since the late Pleistocene, leaving 32 extant species. We examine the latent conservation potential, benefits, and risks of using tortoise taxon substitutes as a strategy for restoring dysfunctional ecosystems. We highlight how, especially on islands, conservation practitioners are starting to employ extant large tortoises in ecosystems to replace extinct tortoises that once played keystone roles.

AB  - Mammals and birds are the only animals that exhibit rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep and slow-wave sleep (SWS). Whereas the electroencephalogram (EEG) during REM sleep resembles the low-amplitude, high-frequency EEG of wakefulness, the EEG during SWS displays high-amplitude, slow-waves (1-4 Hz). The absence of similar slow-waves (SWs) in sleeping reptiles suggests that the neuroanatomical and neurophysiological traits necessary for the genesis of SWs evolved independently in the mammalian and avian ancestors. Advances in our understanding of comparative neuroanatomy and the genesis of mammalian SWs suggest that the absence of SWs in reptiles is due to limited connectivity within the pallium, the dorsal portion of the telencephalon that includes the mammalian neocortex, reptilian dorsal cortex and avian Wulst (hyperpallium), as well as the dorsal ventricular ridge in birds and reptiles and the mammalian claustrum and pallial amygdala. In mammals, the slow oscillation (< 1 Hz) of cortical neurons acts through reciprocal corticothalamic loops and corticocortical connections to synchronize the 1-4 Hz activity of thalamocortical neurons in a manner sufficient to generate SWs detectable in the EEG. Given the role that corticocortical (or palliopallial) connections play in the genesis of SWs in mammals, the degree of palliopallial connectivity might explain why birds show SWs and reptiles do not. Indeed, whereas the mammalian neocortex and avian pallium show extensive palliopallial connectivity, the reptilian pallium exhibits limited intrapallial connections. I thus propose that the evolution of SWs is linked to the independent evolution of extensive palliopallial connectivity in mammals and birds. As suggested by experiments functionally linking SWs to performance enhancements, the palliopallial connections that give rise to SWs might also depend on SWs to maintain their efficacy.

AB  - The Southeast Asian box turtle (Cuora amboinensis) is numerically the most important turtle exported from Indonesia. Listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN, this turtle is heavily harvested and exported for food and traditional medicine in China and for the pet trade primarily in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Despite its significance in global markets, relatively little is known about the species' ecology or importance to ecosystems. We conducted our research in a national park in Sulawesi, Indonesia, and our objectives were to quantify trophic breadth, capacity for seed dispersal between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and whether ingestion of seeds byC. amboinensisenhances germination. We obtained diet samples from 200 individual turtles and found that the species is omnivorous, exhibiting an ontogenetic shift from more carnivorous to more omnivorous. Both subadults and adults scavenged on other vertebrates. In a seed passage experiment, turtles passed seeds for 2-9 days after ingestion. Radio-tracked turtles moved, on average, about 35 m per day, indicating that seeds from ingested fruits, given seed passage durations, could be dispersed 70-313 m from the parent tree and potentially between wetland and upland ecosystems. In a seed germination experiment, we found that ingestion of seeds by turtles enhanced germination, as compared with control seeds, for four of six plant species tested. Of these, two are common in the national park, making up a significant proportion of plant biomass in lowland swamp forest and around ephemeral pools in savanna, and are highly valued outside of the park for their lumber for construction of houses, furniture, and boats. Protection ofC. amboinensispopulations may be important for maintaining trophic linkages that benefit biodiversity, communities, and local economies.

AB  - Objective: Tortoise picornavirus (ToPV) has been speculated to play an important role in the frequently seen disease pattern of juvenile shell softening. This study aimed to determine ToPV prevalence among German tortoise collections. Material and methods: A total of 334 animals selected from 27 different collections were included. Seven species of four genera of the family Testudinidae (Testudo graeca, T. hermanni, T. marginata, T. horsfieldii, Centrochelys sulcata, Stigmochelys pardalis, Chelonoidis carbonarius) were sampled. The tortoises were clinically investigated and none of the adults showed any signs of shell softening. Seven hatchlings of a ToPV-positive T. graeca breeding pair showed retarded growth and a progressive shell weakness that resulted in death. Each animal was sampled by conjunctival, pharyngeal and cloacal swabs (990 swabs in total) and blood sampling (293 in total). All three swabs of one animal were pooled and tested by reverse transcriptase polymerise chain reaction (RT-PCR) for tortoise picornavirus RNA. Blood samples were investigated by virus neutralisation test (VNT) for specific anti ToPV antibodies. All titres equal to or higher than log(2) = 2 were considered positive. Results: In total, 35 adult and 11 juvenile animals were tested positive for ToPV RNA. The serological investigation did detect specific antibodies against ToPV in 44 adult tortoises and one juvenile. In total, 76 animals were tested positive in either one of the investigations, 16 animals in both. The highest number of ToPV-positive animals was found for T. graeca, with a prevalence of 32 %. No specimens of C. carbonarius, C. sulcata, or S. pardalis were tested positive. Conclusion and clinical relevance: The results propose a predisposition in T graeca, as well as a high prevalence of ToPV in T. graeca, whereas other species showed only single or no positive animals, but may function as virus carriers.

AB  - Whilst a great deal of research has been focused on identifying ways to assess the welfare of captive mammals and birds, there is comparatively little knowledge on how reptilian species are affected by captivity, and the ways in which their welfare can be accurately assessed. The present study investigated response to novelty a commonly used approach to assess anxiety-like behaviour and hence welfare in non-human animals in two species of reptile with the aim of determining whether this approach could be successfully translated from use in mammalian and avian species for use in reptiles, and whether we could also identify reptile-specific and/or species-specific behaviours. Eight red-footed tortoises (Chelonoidis carbonaria) and seventeen bearded dragons (Pogona vitticeps) were observed individually in both familiar and novel environments for 10 min time periods, and their behaviour recorded. Tortoises were found to begin locomotion sooner when placed in a familiar environment than when placed in a novel environment, they extended their necks further in a familiar environment and their neck length increased over time in both familiar and novel environments, suggesting an overall anxiety-like response to novelty as seen in non-reptilian species. In contrast, whilst bearded dragons exhibited significantly more tongue-touches in a novel, compared to a familiar, environment, they showed no difference between familiar and novel environments in their latency to move. This result suggests that, whilst the dragons appeared to discriminate between the two environments, this discrimination was not necessarily accompanied by an anxiety-like response. This study has confirmed the translatability of response to novelty as an approach to assess anxiety-like behaviour in one species of reptile, as well as identifying species-specific behaviours that have the potential to be used in future studies when assessing the welfare of reptiles in response to captive environments, but our results also highlight the need to be aware of species differences within a class as diverse as reptilia.

AB  - The Brazilian Testudinidae family is widespread across South America. It includes Chelonoidis denticulatus, the largest tortoise in South America and Chelonoidis carbonarius, found mostly in the north and northwestern part of the continent. Using hemoglobin to identify species is cheaper than other methods such as DNA sequencing and can offer useful information, since the hemoglobin molecule is a well-preserved protein chain during the evolution of species. Thus, in order to establish a hemoglobin profile for the Brazilian Testudinidae C. denticulatus, C. carbonarius and morphotype 1, hemoglobin electrophoresis was performed at acid pH in phosphate agar and at alkaline pH in cellulose acetate, in order to visualize the specific fractions of each species. High performance liquid chromatography was used for the quantification of fractions. For an in-depth analysis and better detailing of the hemoglobin profile of the species, polypeptide chain electrophoresis was performed at acid and alkaline pH. We observed differences in the hemoglobin profiles of C. denticulatus in relation to C. carbonarius and morphotype 1, which suggests that this methodology, not common in taxonomic studies, can help determine relationships between species, since hemoglobins are proteins with well-preserved genes. We found differences in hemoglobin mobility between C. denticulatus, C. carbonarius and morphotype 1 in electrophoresis at alkaline pH, however, the behavior of globin chains was similar between the three groups. High performance liquid chromatography showed different retention times in the globin fractions of C. denticulatus and C. carbonarius, but not between C. carbonarius and morphotype 1, indicating that, possibly, the divergence time between C. carbonarius and morphotype 1 is more recent than the divergence between C. denticulatus and C. carbonarius, due to the highly conserved character of this functional protein. Thus, considering the high degree of conservation of hemoglobins in vertebrates, and the differences observed in electrophoresis at alkaline pH and HPLC, we infer that C. carbonarius and morphotype 1 present a common branch.

AB  - In nucleate erythrocytes of several vertebrate groups, the frequency and intensity of DNA fragmentation associated with programed cell death vary considerably. Although hemoglobin efficiency may be related to erythrocyte life span, and hemoglobin types and erythrocyte life spans are assumed to vary in reptiles, no data on DNA fragmentation and chromatin organization as related to cell death exist for snakes. In the present study, chromatin supraorganization, DNA fragmentation, and cell death were investigated in four snake species (Crotalus durissus terrificus, Bothrops jararaca, Bothrops alternatus, and Bothrops neuwiedii), which differ in their geographical distribution and habitats, by using image analysis of Feulgen hydrolysis kinetics, the TUNEL assay, single-cell gel electrophoresis, and transmission electron microscopy. Relatively few circulating erythrocytes were found to be simultaneously committed to cell death, although there was some variation among the snake species. Conspicuous nuclear and cytoplasmic organelles suggestive of metabolic activity were seen ultrastructurally in most snake erythrocytes. The DNA of the snake erythrocyte chromatin was much more resistant to Feulgen acid hydrolysis (DNA depurination and breakdown) than that of young adult bullfrog erythrocytes, which had a high frequency and intensity of DNA fragmentation. Of the species studied, B. neuwiedii and C. d. terrificus showed the greatest resistance to Feulgen acid hydrolysis and to the DNA fragmentation, revealed by the TUNEL assay. Although B. neuwiedii also showed the lowest frequency of cells with more damaged DNA in the single-cell gel electrophoresis assay, C. d. terrificus had the highest frequency of damaged cells, possibly because of the abundance of alkaline-sensitive DNA sites. The results for DNA fragmentation and cell death in erythrocytes of B. jararaca and B. alternatus generally differed from those for C. d. terrificus and B. neuwiedii and may reflect differences in the biology of these species selected under different geographical habitats. The differences in erythrocyte cell biology reported here may be related to hemoglobin variants selected in the mentioned snake species and that would lead the cells to different resistances to unfavorable environmental conditions.

AB  - The complete primary structures of alpha(D)-2- and beta-globin of hemoglobin D (Hb D) from the Aldabra giant tortoise, Geochelone gigantea, have been constructed by amino acid sequencing analysis in assistance with nucleotide sequencing analysis of PCR fragments amplified using degenerate oligonucleotide primers. Using computer-assisted sequence comparisons, the alpha(D)-2-globin shared a 92.0% sequence identity versus alpha(D)-globin of Geochelone carbonaria, a 75.2% versus alpha(D)-globin of Aves (Rhea americana) and a 62.4% versus alpha(A)-globin of Hb A expressed in adult red blood cells of Geochelone gigantea. Additionally, judging from their primary structures, an identical beta-globin was common to the two hemoglobin components, Hb A and Hb D. The alpha(D)-2- and beta-globin genes contained the three-exon and two-intron configurations and showed the characteristic of all functional vertebrate hemoglobin genes except an abnormal GC dinucleotide instead of the invariant GT at the 5' end of the second intron sequence. The introns of alpha(D)-2-globin gene were both small (224-bp/first intron, 227-bp/second intron) such that they were quite similar to those of adult alpha-type globins; the beta-globin gene has one small intron (approximately 130-bp) and one large intron (approximately 1590-bp).
   A phylogenetic tree constructed on primary structures of 7 alpha(D)-globins from Reptilia (4 species of turtles, 2 species of squamates, and 1 species of sphenodontids) and two embryonic a-like globins from Aves (Gullus gullus) and Mammals (Homo sapiens) showed the following results: (1) alpha(D)-globins except those of squamates were clustered, in which Sphenodon punctatus was a closer species to birds than turtles; (2) separation of the alpha(A)- and alpha(D)-globin genes occurred approximately 250 million years ago after the embryonic alpha-type globin-genes (pi' and zeta) first split off from the ancestor of alpha-type globin gene family.

AB  - Red blood cells of yellow-spotted river turtles (Podocnemis unifilis, Pleurodira, Chelonia, REPTILIA) have two hemoglobin (Hb) components, Hb A and Hb D. We purified the hemoglobin component homologous to amniote (reptiles, birds, and mammals) adult Hb A which comprises two identical alpha(A)-globin polypeptides and two identical beta-globin polypeptides. To establish the crystal structure of Podocnemis Hb A, we first determined the globin primary structures using cDNA nucleotide sequencing with the assistance of protein sequencing. The purified Podocnemis Hb A produced a different form of crystal for each of the two different buffer systems used: form A, tetragonal crystals (space group, P4(1)2(1)2), produced under neutral pH (pH 7-8) conditions; and form B, hexagonal crystals (space group, P6122), produced under high alkaline pH (pH 11-13) conditions. Single crystals of the two forms were examined by Raman microscopy with an excitation of 532 nm, indicating their structural differences. The crystal structures of the two forms were constructed by X-ray crystallographic diffraction at a resolution of 2.20 angstrom for form A and 2.35 angstrom for form B. The differences of the tertiary and quaternary structures of the two forms were marginal; however, one clear difference was found in helix structure. When comparing Podocnemis Hb A with Hb A from specimens in other taxa, such as Anser indicus (birds) and Homo sapiens (mammals) by SHELXPRO, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the corresponding C alpha atoms of the two globins does not exceed 2.0 angstrom. These low values indicate the crystal structures resemble each other. Our data on X-ray crystal structures and Raman spectra not only reveal the first findings on the

AB  - The Cerrado is Brazil's tropical savannah, which is arguably under greater threat than the Amazon rainforest. The Cerrado Biome of tropical South America covers about 2 million km(2) and is considered a biodiversity hot spot which means that it is especially rich in endemic species and particularly threatened by human activities. The Cerrado is increasingly exposed to agricultural activities which enhance the likelihood of mixing parasites from rural, urban and wildlife areas. Information about ticks from the Cerrado biome is scarce. In this report tick species free-living, on domestic animals and on a few wild animals in two farms in the Cerrado biome (Nova Crixas and Araguapaz municipalities, Goias State, Brazil) are described. Amblyomma cajennense was the first and Amblyomma parvum the second host-seeking tick species found. Only two other tick species were found free-living: one Amblyomma nodosum and three Amblyomma naponense nymphs. Cattle were infested with Boophilus microplus and A. cajennense. Buffalos were infested with B. microplus and A. parvum. Dogs were infested with A. cajennense, Amblyomma ovale, A. parvum and Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks. Anocentor nitens, B. microplus, A. cajennense, and A. parvum were found on horses. Amblyomma auricularium were found attached to nine-banded armadillos and Amblyomma rotundatum to red-footed tortoise, cururu toads and a rattlesnake. The latter was also infested with an adult A. cajennense. No tick was found on a goat, a tropical rat snake and a yellow armadillo. Among the observations the infestation of several domestic animals with A. parvum seems be the main feature. It suggests that this species might become a pest. However, the life cycle of A. parvum in nature, as well as its disease vectoring capacity, are largely unknown. It would be important to determine if it is a species expanding its geographic range by adaptation to new hosts or if it has been maintained in high numbers at definite locations by specific and still undetermined conditions. A higher prevalence of A. cajennense in most Brazilian biomes, with the exception of rainforests, was already shown before. Thus this species is favored by deforestation and is an important research target as it is the most common vector associated with the Brazilian spotted fever.

AB  - It is crucial to determine whether rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and slow-wave sleep (SWS) (or non-REM sleep), identified in most mammals and birds, also exist in lizards, as they share a common ancestor with these groups. Recently, a study in the bearded dragon (P. vitticeps) reported states analogous to REM and SWS alternating in a surprisingly regular 80-s period, suggesting a common origin of the two sleep states across amniotes. We first confirmed these results in the bearded dragon with deep brain recordings and electrooculogram (EOG) recordings. Then, to confirm a common origin and more finely characterize sleep in lizards, we developed a multiparametric approach in the tegu lizard, a species never recorded to date. We recorded EOG, electromyogram (EMG), heart rate, and local field potentials (LFPs) and included data on arousal thresholds, sleep deprivation, and pharmacological treatments with fluoxetine, a serotonin reuptake blocker that suppresses REM sleep in mammals. As in the bearded dragon, we demonstrate the existence of two sleep states in tegu lizards. However, no clear periodicity is apparent. The first sleep state (S1 sleep) showed high-amplitude isolated sharp waves, and the second sleep state (S2 sleep) displayed 15-Hz oscillations, isolated ocular movements, and a decrease in heart rate variability and muscle tone compared to S1. Fluoxetine treatment induced a significant decrease in S2 quantities and in the number of sharp waves in S1. Because S2 sleep is characterized by the presence of ocular movements and is inhibited by a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, as is REM sleep in birds and mammals, it might be analogous to this state. However, S2 displays a type of oscillation never previously reported and does not display a desynchronized electroencephalogram (EEG) as is observed in the bearded dragons, mammals, and birds. This suggests that the phenotype of sleep states and possibly their role can differ even between closely related species. Finally, our results suggest a common origin of two sleep states in amniotes. Yet, they also highlight a diversity of sleep phenotypes across lizards, demonstrating that the evolution of sleep states is more complex than previously thought.

AB  - The current paper proposes a unique approach by examining the ancient Greek literature and antique black figure amphorae's representations (also known as melanomorpha) for the reconstruction, after digital design processing, of a modern top-quality replica of an ancient tortoise lyre. Through the review of certain ancient Greek documents, the observation of the amphorae's relevant representations, 3D scanning and reverse engineering as well as 3D design using advanced Computer Aided Design (CAD) software, this study illustrates the detailed drawings and the fabrication procedures followed for a modern version of the ancient musical instrument. By using only materials available in antiquity such as specific kinds of wood, tortoise carcasses and sheep strings, as well as modern carpentry technology, a high-quality musical instrument was produced suited for use by today's professional musicians. Two variations were produced and tested utilizing the Phrygian and Lydian ancient Greek music scales in a specialized unechoic chamber, in order to define their sound properties. Typical statistics were computed in the frequency domain such as spectral centroid, spectral standard deviation, spectral skewness, spectral kurtosis along with spectral rolloff and spectral smoothness in order to justify the lyres' quality as musical instruments. The result was a prototype music product using advanced 3D design procedures that can be produced in a rather repeatable manner.
