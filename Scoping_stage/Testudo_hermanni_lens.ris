AB  - Herman's tortoise, Testudo h. hermanni, is an endangered subspecies in Italy, France, and Spain. We studied a Herman's tortoise population in the Riserva Naturale Regionale Monterano in the Tolfa Mountains of central Italy. We found that, unlike most other studies of this and related species, sex ratios were 1:1, and half the population was made up of juveniles. Sexual maturity was reached at 12 years in males and 12-13 years in females, and females were significantly larger. Tortoises greatly preferred open maquis habitat over other habitat types and thermoregulated so that body temperatures stayed consistently above ambient temperatures, especially under low ambient temperature conditions. Presence of ticks was significantly associated with an index of thermoregulatory behavior. We suggest that maintenance of open maquis habitat in this reserve is essential to high hatchling production and effective thermoregulation.

AB  - Growth ring counts on the shell have been widely used for age estimation in Chelonians. However, as stated by Wilson et al. (2003), most studies have applied this method without assessing its reliability by proving that 1 : 1 ratio between number of rings and real age exists. In the present study, the reliability of this method is analysed for a population of Hermann's Tortoise, Testudo hermanni introduced in the Ebro Delta (NE Spain). Age estimations were obtained from direct observations of tortoises in the field in 2000 (n = 82) together with those from photographs of the same and other individuals of the population taken between 1991 and 2001 (n= 356). A second photograph was taken at one or more years after the first one for 101 individuals. Results of Model II linear regression analysis indicated that the method was reliable only for tortoises between 0 and 7 years old, whereas tended to underestimate age for those between 8 and 11 years. Since, sexual maturity in this population is attained around 8 years (mean for both sexes), ring counts are only reliable for juveniles and subadults. Finally, it is noteworthy that the results coming for photographs were equivalent to those coming from direct observations in the field.

AB  - Physiological parameters provide indicators to evaluate how organisms respond to conservation actions. For example, individuals translocated during reinforcement programmes may not adapt to their novel host environment and may exhibit elevated chronic levels of stress hormones and/or decreasing body condition. Conversely, successful conservation actions should be associated with a lack of detrimental physiological perturbation. However, physiological references fluctuate over time and are influenced by various factors (e.g. sex, age, reproductive status). It is therefore necessary to determine the range of natural variations of the selected physiological metrics to establish useful baselines. This study focuses on endangered free-ranging Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni hermanni), where conservation actions have been preconized to prevent extinction of French mainland populations. The influence of sex and of environmental factors (site, year and season) on eight physiological parameters (e.g. body condition, corticosterone concentrations) was assessed in 82 individuals from two populations living in different habitats. Daily displacements were monitored by radio-tracking. Most parameters varied between years and seasons and exhibited contrasting sex patterns but with no or limited effect of site. By combining behavioural and physiological traits, this study provides sex-specific seasonal baselines that can be used to monitor the health status of Hermann's tortoises facing environmental threats (e.g. habitat changes) or during conservation actions (e.g. translocation). These results might also assist in selection of the appropriate season for translocation.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to describe, for the LIPU Castel di Guido Oasis, within the Castel di Guido Farm, on the Roman coast, the different spatial distribution of the different species of reptiles that coexist in the area. The work also defines correlations between the presence of animals and the various environmental and vegetation types present. In the study area, Testudo hermanni is a species that has the feeding areas, as well as the deposition areas, in the prairies adjacent the plant formation of the Mediterranean maquis(within 5 meters). Hemidactylus turcicus and Tarentola mauritanica seem to have a localization exclusively in the context of anthropic structures. Chalcides chalcides and Podarcis siculus appear to be confined to prairie areas, while Podarcis muralis is associated with the presence of trees of high-trunk plant associations. For Lacerta bilineata, a correspondence is outlined for the areas with arboreal shrubby vegetation, especially close to more humid habitats. Among the snakes Hierophis viridiflavus appears to be an ubiquitous species, with the frequentation of different habitats in the same percentage; more localized appear Vipera aspis and Elaphe quatuorlineata, the first more linked to wooded areas with the presence of bushy and shrubby vegetal coverings, the second is often associated with the simultaneous presence of forests and water collections. In general it is confirmed, as regards the snake community, the importance of ecotonal and transitional zones. The work also highlights how the study area is important for the conservation of reptile populations in the Roman area.

AB  - The high frequency of same-sex sexual behaviors (SSB) in free-ranging animals is an evolutionary puzzle because fitness benefits are often unclear in an evolutionary context. Moreover, the physiological and genetic underpinnings of SSB remain unclear. We exploited an extraordinary natural experiment to examine the impact of environmental factors (local sex ratio [SR]) and testosterone (T) levels on SSB in a dense population of Hermann’s tortoises monitored for 7 years. Under the combination of high density and extremely skewed SR (~50 females, >1000 males), males courted and mounted other males more frequently than females. They even exhibited extravagant sexual behaviors, attempting to copulate with dead conspecifics, empty shells, and stones. T levels remained within the species’ normal range of variation. SSB was not observed in other populations where SR is not, or less skewed, and where density is lower. This study reports the first natural example of a "prison effect," whereby a high population density combined with female deprivation triggered SSB as a mere outlet of sexual stimulation. More generally, it supports the hypothesis that SSB can be a nonadaptive consequence of unusual proximate factors rather than reflecting physiological disorders.

AB  - Conserving and managing an imperiled species, such as Testudo hermanni, requires information on population status and demographic traits. To acquire this information, we surveyed Hermann's tortoises, Testudo hermanni boettgeri, in European Turkey from April to October 2014–2016. We found 283 (135 males, 102 females, 45 juveniles, and 1 unknown) T. h. boettgeri at 34 locations. Of these sites, 29% included at least 1 individual. We found that females were larger and heavier (mean straight carapace length [SCL] = 175.4 mm, body mass = 1234.1 g) than males (SCL = 153.2 mm, body mass = 849.6 g). The age frequency had a normal Gaussian distribution with 11–15 yrs being the most common. Elevation at capture sites ranged from 22 to 380 m above sea level. Illegal overharvesting for the pet trade appears to have caused no reduction in body size.

AB  - Although some studies investigated lateralization in reptiles, little research has been done on chelonians, focusing only on few behaviours such as righting response and escape preference. The aim of this study was to investigate lateralization in Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea), focusing on asymmetrical positioning of the limbs and the head during resting behaviour, called sleep-like behaviour, involving both wild tortoises and individuals under human care. Subjects of the study were 67 adult Aldabra tortoises (54 free ranging on Curieuse, 13 under human care in Mahe Botanical Garden). For each tortoise observed during sleep-like behaviour, we recorded the position of the head (on the left, on the right or in line with the body midline) and we collected which forelimb and hindlimb were kept forward. Moreover, the number of subjects in which limbs were in a symmetrical position during the sleep-like behaviour was recorded. Based on our results, the number of tortoises with asymmetrical position of head and limb was higher (head: 63%; forelimbs: 88%; hindlimbs: 70%) than the number of tortoises with symmetrical position of the head and the limb. Regarding the head, throughout the subjects found with the asymmetrical position of the head during sleep-like behaviour, tortoises positioning the head on the right (42%) were more than those sleeping with the head on the left (21%). We found a relationship between the position of the forelimbs and hindlimbs during sleep-like behaviour. We reported no differences between Mahe (under human care) and Curieuse (wild) tortoises. Findings of this preliminary study underlined traces of group-level lateralization in head positioning during the sleep-like behaviour, possibly due to a left-eye/right-hemisphere involvement in anti-predatory responses and threatening stimuli as reported in reptiles and other vertebrates. This study aims at adding data on brain lateralization, often linked to lateralized behaviours, in reptiles, especially in chelonians.

AB  - Objective—To determine the pharmacokinetics of cefovecin sodium after SC administration to Hermann’s tortoises (Testudo hermanni). Animals—23 healthy adult Hermann’s tortoises (15 males and 8 females). Procedures—Cefovecin (8.0 mg/kg) was injected once in the subcutis of the neck region of Hermann’s tortoises, and blood samples were obtained at predetermined time points. Plasma cefovecin concentrations were measured via ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated with a noncompartmental model. Plasma protein concentration was quantified, and the percentage of cefovecin bound to protein was estimated with a centrifugation technique. Results—Cefovecin was absorbed rapidly, reaching maximum plasma concentrations between 35 minutes and 2 hours after administration, with the exception of 1 group, in which it was reached after 4 hours. The mean ± SD time to maximum concentration was 1.22 ± 1.14 hours; area under the concentration-time curve was 220.35 ± 36.18 h￻µg/mL The mean protein-bound fraction of cefovecin ranged from 41.3% to 47.5%. No adverse effects were observed. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Administration of a single dose of cefovecin SC appeared to be well-tolerated in this population of tortoises. Results of pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that the 2-week dosing interval suggested for dogs and cats cannot be considered effective in tortoises; however, further research is needed to determine therapeutic concentrations of the drug and appropriate dose ranges.

AB  - The Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) is increasingly threatened in Western Europe and in Italy because of habitat loss, pollution, and illegal removal of free‐ranging individuals for the pet trade. Hence, the conservation and appropriate management of the various populations is mandatory, and the few remnant, isolated populations inhabiting urban parks and heavily altered landscapes may be particularly important. An urban population of Hermann's tortoises was studied by capture–mark–recapture procedures in an ‘urban green area’ in Rome (‘Insugherata’ Natural Reserve), between March 2001 and October 2005. A spatial modelling approach (logistic regression, with forward stepwise addition model) was developed to investigate which proximate landscape factors influenced the presence/absence of the tortoises. Eight different variables were considered for this model. We found that a single variable (SHRUBS, i.e. Mediterranean dry macchia‐like vegetation) was positively correlated to the presence of tortoises...

AB  - In this paper we present the results of the analysis of morphological characteristics of the Hermann's tortoise from three localities in south­eastern part of Kosovo and Metohija. 75 adult Hermann's tortoises (33 males and 42 females) have been analyzed. Morphometric analysis has been done on 7 traits. We considered the plastron black pigmentation patterns and frequencies for each pigmentation states were calculated. Females were larger than males for all morphometric traits. Based on the most important dimensions of carapace and plastron length and width, the Hermann's tortoises from the south-eastern part of Kosovo and Metohija are the most similar to the individuals of the population from the southern part of the Balkan Peninsula (the southern part of Serbia and the northern part of Greece). In relation to the populations from central and eastern Serbia, individuals from our studied area have higher values.

AB  - Increase of the fecundity in Hermann 's Tortoise Testudo hermanni hermanni in insular conditions: an opposite case of the insular syndrome? - The reproductive parameters of the Hermann's Tortoise Testudo hermanni were studied by
 radiography in Corsica (Porto-Vecchio -island population-) and in Provence (Maures Massif -mainland population-). The following parameters were measured: number of eggs per clutch, clutch frequency, annual fecundity (eggs produced per female per year) and size of the eggs. There was a
 significantly higher fecundity in the island area, i.e. more eggs per clutch (4 against 3), a higher clutch frequency (1.9 against 1.4) and a global fecundity of 7.7 eggs/female/year as compared to 4.2 eggs/female/year in the mainland area. This increase in fecundity did not change also
 after taking into account the size of the females, which were larger in the island area. Indeed, female size does not influence the size of the eggs. The observed increase in fecundity contradicts the theory of the insular syndrome which predicts a decrease in fecundity in insular
 conditions. This dissension may be the result of the originality of tortoises at the ecophysiological level (long lifetime herbivore species) or may partially depend on distinct local adaptations.

AB  - We investigated the relation between righting time (RT) and carapace morphology in 303 adult Hermann’s tortoises (Testudo hermanni Gmelin, 1789) from two geographically close localities. Their size, shape and body mass, adjusted for size, were significantly different between males and females. Righting time differed among the populations and was related to the ambient temperature and the relative body mass and carapace shape. However, analysis showed that the impact of carapace “form” (shape plus relative body mass) alone had only moderate influence on the variation in righting time (“function”). Both “form” and “function” did not contribute much to the segregation of individuals in geometric space, based on either sex or locality. An interesting detail was that tortoises with a height/width ratio of the shell contour higher than 0.75 had quite a short righting time (less than 100 seconds), which is in accordance with the proposed theoretical model of energy balance of righting in chelonians. We suppose that interactions between general carapace “form”, specific components of shell structure, physiological parameters and local environments shape variation in righting response in this species. An interdisciplinary approach combining geometric modeling with traditional biological disciplines would be needed to support this hypothesis.

AB  - <jats:p>Based on the critical review of the literature published in the last 22 years, an attempt was made to evaluate the current knowledge gap on the distribution and status of the native Testudines taxa occurring in Sicily (namely Caretta caretta, Emys trinacris, and Testudo hermanni hermanni), as well as the available knowledge of the only non-native species with putative viable populations occurring on the island, i.e., Trachemys scripta. Summarizing the current information, all of the Testudines species occurring in Sicily showed a fragmented and incompletely-known distribution, and only scarce data are available about their phenology. Moreover, despite their inclusion of international and national laws (Bern Convention, CITES, Habitat directive), all three native species are facing several threats (e.g., habitat alteration, the occurrence of invasive species, parasite spillover) leading to a reduction of their populations on the island. Future monitoring programs on the island should be enhanced, with an emphasis on those taxa in decline. Moreover, involve Citizen Science programs should also be implemented in order to increase the awareness of non-experts and facilitate the monitoring task.</jats:p>

AB  - Censuses of population fragments of the Endangered, endemic Hermann's tortoise Testudo hermanni hermanni were carried out during 2001–2005 in mainland France to reassess their status and provide guidelines for conservation management. Comparisons with previous censuses suggest a decline in abundance since 1992, although the total area of distribution remains unchanged. If conservation and management decisions only consider sites where there is a high encounter rate of tortoises, 19 sites would be protected. If indicators of effective reproduction (presence of both sexes, juveniles and subadults) are taken into account, 31 sites would deserve attention, of which only 10 have high encounter rates. Discarding sites with low encounter rates omits c. 70% of sites where the species appears to be reproducing. I provide a new map that includes demographic parameters, and thus describe 16 reproductive fragments plus four where reproduction is suspected. In the long-term the major conservation goal should be to protect these fragments and facilitate their reconnection. The global population of Hermann's tortoise could thus be largely contained in eight large fragments, enhancing the persistence of this species in mainland France.

AB  - The Hermann’s tortoise (Testudo hermanni) is an endangered land tortoise distributed in disjoint populations across Mediterranean Europe. We investigated its genetic variation by typing 1 mitochondrial locus and 9 nuclear microsatellites in approximately 300 individuals from 22 localities. Our goal was to understand the relative impact of natural and human-mediated processes in shaping the genetic structure and to identify the genetic priorities for the conservation of this species. We found that 1) all geographic areas are highly differentiated, mainly as a function of their distance but with a clear genetic discontinuity (F st values larger than 0.4) between the Eastern and the Western subspecies; 2) the contact zone between subspecies is located farthest to the west than previously believed, and it probably coincides with the delta of the largest Italian river; 3) extinction events due to climatic conditions in the Upper Palaeolithic and subsequent human-mediated translocations in the Neolithic possibly explain the unexpected similarity among Spain, Sicily, and Corsica. For conservation purposes, the large majority of genetic pools appears native although hybridization among subspecies, related to extensive 20th century trade of tortoises across Europe, is observed in Spain and some Italian samples. Most populations do not seem at immediate risk of low genetic variation, except the French population, which has very low nuclear genetic diversity (heterozygosity = 0.25) and where 50 out of 51 sampled animals shared the same mitochondrial sequence. In general, restocking and reintroduction plans should carefully consider the genetic background of the individuals.

AB  - An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for the detection of antibodies to a herpesvirus associated with an upper respiratory tract disease in Mediterranean tortoises [spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) and Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni)]. This serodiagnostic test was validated through a hyperimmunization study. The mean of the A(405) readings of the plasma samples collected at time zero of the hyperimmunization study plus three times the standard deviation was used as the cutoff for seropositivity in tortoises. ELISA results were compared to serum neutralization (SN) values for the same samples by using the McNemar test. The results obtained by SN and ELISA were not significantly different (P > 0.05). This new ELISA could be used as an important diagnostic tool for screening wild populations and private and zoo collections of Mediterranean tortoises.

AB  - <jats:p>Testudines show phenotypic plasticity, and variation among specific populations within a species is widespread. Morphological differences between populations reflect ecological factors that drive adaptation to local conditions. In this context, gathered basic data on morphology of the Hermann&amp;rsquo;s tortoise (Testudo hermanni boettgeri) to document their variation across different geographical regions. We surveyed Hermann&amp;rsquo;s tortoises, in five different locales within Albania during April and May 2020 and measured 20 morphological characteristics, including carapace and plastron dimensions. We measured 188 tortoises (81 males, 107 females) in this study, and females were larger (P=.0001) and heavier (P=.0001) than males. Mean straight carapace length [SCL] and body mass were = 172.4 mm and 1128.8 g, respectively, for females and 151.3 mm and 735 g, respectively, for males. The overall Albanian T. h. boettgeri population were regionally diverged into 3 different populations that were situated in northern (Shkodra), central (Tirana, Berati and Ballshi) and southern (Saranda) Albania. The body size (curved carapace length; CCL) of females was positively correlated (r=0.216; P=0.025) with the latitude degree, in accordance with Bergmann's rule. However, there was no correlation between body size and degrees north latitude in males. These striking regional differences among Albanian T. h. boettgeri strongly suggest that further study of molecular variations in and reproductive output of Hermann&amp;rsquo;s tortoises is warranted.</jats:p>

AB  - Road-associated mortality can lead to local declines of wildlife populations, and management agencies are actively implementing mitigation measures, especially focused on potential road mortality hotspots. In this study we used a spatially-explicit simulation modeling approach to estimate the hotspots of road mortality for the Eastern Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni boettgeri) within its distribution range in Romania. Using a field experiment, we first evaluated velocities while crossing roads. Adult male tortoises moved faster than females (3.98 m/min vs. 2.51 m/min) which led to higher individual probabilities for females being killed on high-traffic roads (0.61 for females vs. 0.44 for males at traffic levels of 7000 vehicles/day). Both males and females had similar road mortality probabilities for traffic levels 35 000 vehicles/day. Our spatially explicit model suggests that, within the entire Romanian distributional range, the tortoises have an overall risk of road mortality 1.6%, which may have a negative impact on tortoise populations. Using the Getis-Ord Gi statistic, we identified road mortality hotspots with mortality rates of 5-30%, in areas bisected by high-traffic national and European-level roads. Our research is timely in that many low-traffic roads are predicted to have increased traffic associated with tourism activities, thus increasing the overall risk of mortality. We suggest that mitigation measures such as signage and roadside fences associated with underpasses have the potential to limit road mortality of this threatened species within predicted current mortality hotspots.

AB  - Hermann’s tortoise (Testudo hermanni) is considered near threatened in the wild but, by contrast, it is one of the most popular pet tortoises in Europe. Scant data is reported in the veterinary literature on hematological values for T. hermanni and, to our knowledge, none focused on the subspecies boettgeri (eastern Hermann’s tortoise). Published reports are based on small sample populations, and confusion arises when comparing the sampling sites, the anticoagulants, and the counting methods used. The purpose of the current study was to establish the normal mean values and reference intervals for the main hematological parameters for captive adult T. hermanni boettgeri and to evaluate the reliability of a semiautomated blood analyzer for red blood cell count and hematocrit determination. Blood values were determined in 23 adult tortoises using a Neubauer chamber with Natt and Herrick solution; red blood cells and hematocrit were also measured using a semiautomated blood analyzer.

AB  - Mediterranean and Russian tortoises (Testudo spp.) are popular companion animals (pets), despite ongoing controversy concerning privately keeping reptiles. The arguments used during these controversial discussions have often been based on outdated facts. Therefore, a survey was developed to evaluate the current population structure, husbandry conditions, diet regime, and health status of Testudo species in captivity. More than 75% of the 1075 respondents housed their tortoises in an outdoor enclosure containing a greenhouse or cold frame, which is considered the most species-appropriate way of husbandry. Of the respondents, 67.7% fed their tortoises with the optimum diet of more than 80% grasses and weeds during the summer vegetation period. Only 8.2% of respondents owned a tortoise with a diagnosed disease. According to the results, the likelihood of tortoises developing pyramidal growth syndrome, which can be used as an indicator of the quality of tortoise husbandry, was high in tortoises kept in a terrarium and/or fed a diet of less than 80% grasses and weeds in summer. This likelihood varied among species, with a higher incidence in Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni).

AB  - Despite protection of the species under the Berne Convention, and of the site by planning restrictions, Hermann's tortoises have again been killed at Alyki, 10 years after the original catastrophe. The authors describe the situation leading up to the recent habitat destruction, and its effect. There is a final opportunity to save the tortoise population before it is destroyed by holiday developments.

AB  - The Hermann’s tortoise is a strictly European species found mostly in areas with Mediterranean and sub-Mediterranean climes and, especially the subspecies T. hermanni hermanni, has to deal with various threats which reduced its geographic distribution to only a few isolated populations. Thus, with the objective of recovering natural populations of the species, numerous reintroduction projects are being carried out throughout its historical and prehistorical geographic distribution. The aim of our study is to evaluate the success of the T. hermanni reintroduction project carried out in the Albufera de Valencia Natural Park since 2011, through the analysis of movements, home range sizes and habitat use in a new environment. The recorded activity pattern presents two peaks, one in spring and another in August, and the hibernation period (from December to February) is the same as observed in other populations. We did not find significant differences in home range sizes between sexes, but a tight relation between home range sizes and body sizes with larger individuals having larger home ranges. This relation was not observed for core areas (Kernel at 50%). Considering the habitat use, we did not find differences between the groups of individuals we defined, but different types of habitats were used differently. “Scrub” was the most frequented (∼50%), followed by “dunes” (∼20%), “mallaes” (∼20%) and “forest” (<20%). Our results can be used to improve the success of future reintroduction projects by directing ideal habitat, timing and carapace size of released Hermann’s tortoises.

AB  - Although research on habitat use and habitat selection is essential for understanding population ecology and behavior, most such zoological studies have used only general habitat categories describing main habitat features instead of using modern plant ecological approaches. Here, we analyze Testudo hermanni microhabitat use at a coastal Mediterranean site in central Italy by modeling tortoise presence/absence at three spatial scales, using a logistic regression design and quantitative vegetation and plant community analysis to reveal correlates of tortoise habitat use on a fine scale. Our analyses showed that only a few plant species among the many present, and these on a very small spatial scale, are important determinants of tortoise presence and site selection. We also find that tortoises chose a paradoxical combination of high levels of bare soil and high total vegetation cover. This suggests that these tortoises are selecting small patches of habitat in a matrix of less desirable habitat. Our findings also have important implications for habitat management, in that increasing the number of habitat patches containing the few significant plants is likely to be desirable, whereas increasing the size of such patches is probably less relevant.

AB  - Seventeen populations of T. hermanni in Greece differed substantially in mean adult body size, over a range of about one and a half times in length and three times in mass. Females were the larger sex in all populations; the degree of sexual size dimorphism did not vary with mean body size. The proximate cause of the variation of body size among populations was differences in the duration of growth, rather than egg or hatchling size or the growth rates of juveniles. The age at maturity (α) increased with body size in the 17 populations, while the Bertalanffy growth constant (k) decreased with body size. The quantities αM and M/k (where M is the instantaneous mortality rate) were invariant with body size, suggesting that differences between populations were adaptive rather than the result of short-term disturbance. Body size was greater in cooler areas, and increased with both latitude and altitude. This pattern is opposite to that found in most ectotherms (the reverse Bergmann's rule), and to that which occurs between tortoise species. Several hypotheses about the possible ultimate causes of variation of body size were rejected, including adaptation to long-term habitat disturbance (land use), character displacement, social factors, energetics, thermoregulation, r-K selection, the length of the season available for incubation, or differences in juvenile mortality. The most likely ultimate cause of size variation between sites is differences in adult mortality, the correlation with environmental temperature being through the frequency of fires.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the relationships between total calcium and phosphorus and ionised calcium and phosphorus values in clinically healthy tortoises.



Methods: Jugular blood samples were obtained from 25 tortoises, as part of a health screen of the population. These comprised Hermann’s tortoises, Testudo hermanni boettgeri, spur-thighed tortoises, Testudo graeca ibera, marginated tortoises, Testudo marginata, and horsfield tortoises, Testudo horsfieldi. Plasma from these samples were analysed for total calcium, ionised calcium and phosphorus levels. These samples were taken in the immediate posthibernation period, before the onset of reproductive activity.



Results: Females exhibited statistically significantly higher levels of phosphorus. Ionised calcium and total calcium levels were elevated in females compared with males, but this was not statistically significant. Females did have statistically significantly higher calculated solubility indexes and statistically significantly lower ratios compared with males.



Clinical Significance: This study has provided an insight into the ratios and solubility indexes in tortoises, and this information may lead to further understanding of the significance of these parameters in chelonians.

AB  - There is a relatively low amount of Middle Paleolithic sites in Europe dating to MIS 4. Of the few that exist, several of them lack evidence for anthropogenic fire, raising the question of how this period of global cooling may have affected the Neanderthal population. The Iberian Peninsula is a key area to explore this issue, as it has been considered as a glacial refugium during critical periods of the Neanderthal timeline and might therefore yield archaeological contexts in which we can explore possible changes in the behaviour and settlement patterns of Neanderthal groups during MIS 4. Here we report recent data from Abric del Pastor, a small rock shelter in Alcoy (Alicante, Spain) with a stratified deposit containing Middle Palaeolithic remains. We present absolute dates that frame the sequence within MIS 4 and multi-proxy geoarchaeological evidence of in situ anthropogenic fire, including microscopic evidence of in situ combustion residues and thermally altered sediment. We also present archaeostratigraphic evidence of recurrent, functionally diverse, brief human occupation of the rock shelter. Our results suggest that Neanderthals occupied the Central Mediterranean coast of the Iberian Peninsula during MIS 4, that these Neanderthals were not undergoing climatic stress and they were habitual fire users.

AB  - Although their synthesis has been considered of a great importance for humankind due to their pesticide action (P. Muller won the Nobel prize in 1948 for medicine for the discovery of DDT insecticide action 1 ), subsequent research on organochlorinated compounds as HCHs and DDT and metabolites (e.g. DDE, DDD) has revealed their persistence, bioaccumulation capacity and toxicity (PBT) generating a global concern regarding their effects on living organisms and ecosystems (an overview the harmful effects that persistent organic pollutants may have on biota, their environmental sources and analysis, their environmental trends and processes, their movement through food chains are provided by Jones and de Voogt 2 and Blus 3 ). Hermann’s tortoise (Testudo hermanni boettgeri) belongs to the Palaearctic tortoises and is present in the South-Western part of Romania, where the submediterranean climate appears 4 . Hermann’s tortoise lives in habitats like pasturages, grazing lands, mesophilic oaks rare forests or submediterranean shrubs. Species diet is exclusively herbivorous, sometimes preferring the food represented by the people vegetables gardens. It is a vulnerable species mainly due to the late sexual maturity and slow reproduction rhythm. Habitats destruction and the increase in the number of prey animals (many of the antropophilic) are the main threats on species perpetuation. Hermann’s tortoise is a threatened species according to the Romanian legal framework and a strictly protected species according to the Habitats Directive 5 . Very few studies are available in the literature regarding pesticides effects and bioaccumulation on land tortoises (Testudo genus mainly), most of the papers dealing with aquatic species. A study performed on a population of Testudo hermanni in Southern Greece revealed the effects of some herbicides (2,4dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4–D), 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5–T)) on the reproductive capacity of the species. The results indicate a higher vulnerability of Hermann’s tortoises to the herbicides, which have not been associated with reptile mortality prior to this study 6 . De Solla et al. 7 have determined several pesticides (organochlorine, PCBs, Dibenzodioxin, Furan) in the egg content of snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina serpentina) eggs from St. Lawrence River watershed in the neighborhood of a PCB-contaminated landfill site. They report PCB levels of up to 1% of the egg mass (a maximum of 737.68 ppm) with possible source the aquatic sediments (with PCB concentrations between 2 and 7900 ppm) 8 . The authors do not exclude the possibility that the PCB and organochlorine pesticides to influence the hatching success and the juveniles survivor. PCB concentration in the chorioallantoic membranes of Caretta Caretta seem to be higher than in the egg content 9 . Generally, aquatic species tend to get high concentrations of organochlorine compounds because of the large fish component existing in their diet.

AB  - A novel lymphocystivirus causing typical signs of lymphocystis virus disease in whitemouth croaker (Micropogonias furnieri) on the coast of Uruguay was detected and described recently. Based on genetic analysis of some partially sequenced core genes, the virus seemed to differ from previously described members of the genus Lymphocystivirus. In this study, using next-generation sequencing, the whole genome of this virus was sequenced and analysed. The complete genome was found to be 211,086 bp in size, containing 148 predicted protein-coding regions, including the 26 core genes that seem to have a homologue in every iridovirus genome sequenced to date. Considering the current species demarcation criteria for the family Iridoviridae (genome organization, G+C content, amino acid sequence similarity, and phylogenetic relatedness of the core genes), the establishment of a novel species ("Lymphocystis disease virus 4") in the genus Lymphocystivirus is suggested.

AB  - Shape is a fundamental morphological descriptor, one method of its estimation being from digitally processed images. Elliptic Fourier method is an outline-based morphometrics that has some advantages: it does not require either landmarks or previous knowledge about the shape variation of the objects under study; it can visualize the contour of information and reconstruct the original shape; it can be mathematically normalized to size, rotation and starting point of the contour trace; and it can be conducted automatically using computer software. Hence, the variation can be decomposed into several mutually independent quantitative characteristics. In this manner, unacceptable errors based only on human visual judgment of shape, which is frequently deceptive and misled by size factors, can be effectively eliminated. In this study, we applied an elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA) to assess pigmentation pattern symmetries of plastron (ventral shell) of 52 western Hermann's tortoises (Testudohermannihermanni) studied from private breeders, and belonging to two different Mediterranean populations: Albera (Catalonia, NE Iberian Peninsula, n=14) and Balearic Islands (n=38). Low coefficients of regression appeared between carapace length and symmetrical and asymmetrical components. Based on this sample, it was shown that plastral pigmentation design does not present differences for either the symmetrical or the asymmetrical component. These results provide a baseline for further comparisons in variation of plastral pigmentation pattern based on EFA.

AB  - Hermann's tortoise ( Testudo hermanni Gmelin) of the Island of Asinara (NW Sardinia, Italy) has been studied during a period of four seasons. This population consisted of several individuals of large body size, some of them being amongst the largest known for this species. Bony shells of males were commonly found on this island, while the same was not true for female bony shells. Although wild boars ( Sus scrofa ) are potential large sized predators for tortoises, the analysis of carapace morphology did not reveal injuries signs due to bites. Male tortoises could die due to up-turning, as the result of male-male combats during the mating season, to possible hyperthermia when upturned, and to predation carried out by birds particularly when upturned. Estimated density was 4.88 individuals ha -1 , which was similar to that of conspecifics from other areas studied so far.

AB  - AbstractTestudo hermanni hermanni is becoming seriously endangered throughout its range. It has a scattered distribution, with a small number of residual populations found in Spain, France and Italy. In this study we sampled a population of T. h. hermanni from Southern Tuscany (Massa Marittima, Grosseto), composed of native and introduced individuals (recognizable due to residual signs of previous marking on the carapace). Overall, 95% of the captured individuals were adults and the sex ratio was slightly, but not significantly, biased in favour of females. Population density was relatively high in comparison with other Italian populations, although it was doubled by previous reinforcement. Genetic analysis performed on six polymorphic microsatellite loci revealed a high level of genetic variability and heterozygosity, with no evidence of current inbreeding processes. Moreover, introduced individuals presented genotypes similar to those of the native individuals, thus suggesting that the reinforcement int...

AB  - We recorded the movements of adult Eastern Hermann’s tortoises ( Testudo hermanni boettgeri ) in a local population situated in a complex forested habitat system. The average total movement range size (TMRS) calculated over three consecutive years was 4.56 ha and 7.53 ha for males and females, respectively. The largest estimated TMRS of male and female tortoises was 27 ha and 90 ha, respectively. Six females and three males (or 9% and 4%, respectively, of the overall sample) had a movement range size (MRS) greater than 10 ha. Significant differences between male and female MRS were not detected. Body size had no influence on the MRS of individuals in the sample, except on the core movement range size (CMRS) in males. Although the collected data did not enable calculation of the home range in the studied population, the results indicate that the calculated average TMRS of local Hermann tortoises is larger than the average home range in some other populations. Therefore, in the absence of information on the home range size of local adult tortoises, the MRS could be a suitable alternative for planning local species reserves. https://doi.org/10.2298/ABS170217013S Received: February 17, 2017; Revised: April 2, 2017; Accepted: April 19, 2017; Published online: April 28, 2017 How to cite this article: Stojadinovic DM, Cubric T, Milosevic ĐD, Jovanovic BLj, Corovic JV, Paunovic M, Crnobrnja-Isailovic JM.

AB  - Paper description: Molecular markers, qualitative traits and linear morphometrics disagree on the taxonomical recognition of Balkan’s Hermann’s tortoise (“ Testudo hercegovinensis ”) populations along the eastern Adriatic Sea coast. For the first time, we analyzed the available genetic data and de novo sequences of cyt b mtDNA from Trebinje (type locality of “ Testudo hercegovinensis ”, Bosnia and Herzegovina) and the Pcinja River Valley (an area of great conservation importance in Serbia), using a landscape genetic approach. We provide data on morphological (carapace) variability of two populations obtained by geometric morphometrics. The implemented approaches argue for genetic and morphological distinctiveness of two allopatric populations. Based on cytb mtDNA, the populations from Pcinja and Trebinje belong to divergent genetical clusters within nominal eastern subspecies Testudo hermanni boettgeri . A bstract: The published cytb mtDNA sequences from a previous phylogeographic study of Testudo hermanni and de novo genetic and phenotypic data of samples from the Pcinja River Valley (Serbia, Central Balkans) and Trebinje (Bosnia and Herzegovina) were used to: (i) genetically characterize samples from Pcinja, a region of great importance from the conservation standpoint due to its taxonomic diversity and biogeographical history, and Trebinje, a type locality of a disputed taxon “ Testudo hercegoviensis” Werner, 1899; (ii) to study the link between gene genealogy and geographic distribution by implementing spatial genetic analyses, and (iii) to assess whether the distribution of carapace shape variation is in accordance with genetic clusters. The samples from Pcinja and Trebinje possessed divergent haplotypes that corresponded to east (HI) and west (HV) genetic clusters, respectively. Geometric morphometrics was found to be a suitable method to distinguish divergent genetic clusters, arguing for the reassessment of a subspecific ranking within the currently recognized eastern Hermann’s subspecies, T. h. boettgeri. https://doi.org/10.2298/ABS190604043D Received: June 4, 2019; Revised: July 5, 2019; Accepted: July 15, 2019; Published online: July 25, 2019 How to cite this article: Đurakic MR, Milankov VR.

AB  - Testudo hermanni is included as near‑threatened in the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, while T. hermanni hermanni is considered endangered in the Italian Red List. Appropriate management of smuggled or seized wild individuals is recommended before their reintroduction into the wild. Accordingly, a health monitoring study was carried out. During 2014‑2016, 133 oral swabs and 121 cloacal swabs were collected from a total of approximately 180 free‑ranging and rescued T. hermanni hermanni from eight different Italian regions to investigate the presence of DNA of Testudinid alphaherpesvirus (TeAHV), Chlamydia spp. and Mycoplasma spp. in the oral cavity, and Salmonella spp. isolates in the cloaca. Mycoplasma spp. was detected in 52 out of 87 (59.77%) of rescued and in 1 out of 46 free‑ranging (2.17%) individuals; 33 out of 53 (62.26%) Mycoplasma spp. positive samples were typed as M. agassizii by PCR. Salmonella spp. was isolated from 45 out of 121 (37.19%) cloacal swabs, typed into 14 serovars, and characterized for complete antimicrobial susceptibility. A significantly different distribution of Salmonella spp. isolates was found in 2016 in comparison with 2014 and 2015, without any difference between free‑ranging and rescued tortoises. All the tested tortoises were negative for TeAHV and Chlamydia spp. These results are considered a baseline information critical to monitor the dynamics of these microorganisms in free‑ranging and rescued populations of T. h. hermanni, and to correctly approach the management of rescued animals and possible relocation programs.

AB  - In polygynous mammals, signalling may play a decisive role in mating behavior, mediating the intensity of male fights and female mate choice. During the rutting season, male red deer may show a visible dark patch in their ventral fur. Recently, this patch has been suggested to act as a flexible sexual signal, due to its relationships with other variables such as age, body size, antler development, volatile compounds, or the competitive environment. The analysis of fur pigmentation at the ventral patch suggests that this might also visually indicate the male intrinsic predisposition to take part in mating competition. To assess the possible role of this trait as a communicative signal related to mate competition, we used red deer behavioral observations during the rut in Donana National Park (Spain) to examine the link between the degree of expression of the dark ventral patch and the rutting activity (assessed from both intra-and-inter-sexual behaviors). Consistent with our predictions, we found in a field study that males with large dark patches showed a higher frequency of rutting behaviors (mainly roaring and flehmen), more interactions with females, and attained larger harem sizes. The dark ventral patch was a better predictor of male behavior than antler tines or territory holding, thus standing as a short-term indicator of male willingness to invest in mating competition.

AB  - <jats:p>Natural marks have increasingly been used as a tool for individual identification in capture–mark–recapture techniques. Photo-identification is a noninvasive alternative to traditional marking techniques, allowing individual recognition of species through time and space. We tested the APHIS (Automatic Photo Identification Suite) software as a software capable of identifying individuals of Hermann’s Tortoise ( Testudo hermanni Gmelin, 1789) and European Pond Turtle ( Emys orbicularis (Linneaus, 1758)) in different populations during capture–release sessions in the field based on plastron color patterns, since they can be used as natural marks for identification. For this individual identification, spot pattern matching (SPM) and image template matching (ITM) procedures were tested, achieving 100% success of individuals recognized in both procedures and visually verified by comparing the images. However, the ITM procedure was more efficient at recognizing recaptures than SPM because ITM allowed faster recapture verification, since most of the matches were directly placed in the first position on the candidate list. Previous studies used photo-identification on freshwater or sea turtles but never with terrestrial tortoise species. Consequently, it was corroborated that APHIS is a competent and efficient software considering photo-identification of T. hermanni and E. orbicularis, and that it can be applied to close species with similar and unique individual color patterns in their plastron.</jats:p>

AB  - Daily activity patterns of Testudo hermanni in summer are described for two sites, Alyki, a coastal heathland in Greece, and the Massif des Maures, a woodland in France. Activity was bimodal in the former and unimodal in the latter. Habitat type was thought to be more important than latitude and climate in accounting for this pattern. AtAlyki there was a sex ratio of encounters of2. 7 ♂: 1 ♀ in summer, but no differences between the sexes in daily activity pattern. In the Massif des Maures, the ratio varied through the season, from 0.5 ♂: 1 9 in June, to 2.6 ♂: 1 9 in September, suggesting seasonal differences in activity of the sexes. Population density at Alyki was 5 times greater than in the Massif des Maures, yet sighting frequency was similar. This was accounted for by the increased ease offinding active animals in the woodland from the noise they made in the leaf litter.

AB  - Background
Leptospiral infections in poikilothermic (cold blooded) animals have received very little attention and the literature concerning natural infections of these animals is limited. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of leptospiral antibodies in reptiles, imported into Slovenia and intended to be pets in close contact with humans. A total of 297 reptiles (22 snakes, 210 lizards and 65 turtles) were tested for specific antibodies against serovars of Leptospira interrogans sensu stricto using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Live cultures of different serovars were used as antigens. MAT was performed according to standard procedures and the degree of reaction was interpreted by estimating the percentage of agglutinated leptospires. Samples showing titres of ≥ 50 against one or more serovars were considered as positive.

AB  - The N-mixture model is widely used to estimate the abundance of a population in the presence of unknown detection probability from only a set of counts subject to spatial and temporal replication (Royle, 2004, Biometrics 60, 105–115). We explain and exploit the equivalence of N-mixture and multivariate Poisson and negative-binomial models, which provides powerful new approaches for fitting these models. We show that particularly when detection probability and the number of sampling occasions are small, infinite estimates of abundance can arise. We propose a sample covariance as a diagnostic for this event, and demonstrate its good performance in the Poisson case. Infinite estimates may be missed in practice, due to numerical optimization procedures terminating at arbitrarily large values. It is shown that the use of a bound, K, for an infinite summation in the N-mixture likelihood can result in underestimation of abundance, so that default values of K in computer packages should be avoided. Instead we propose a simple automatic way to choose K. The methods are illustrated by analysis of data on Hermann's tortoise Testudo hermanni.

AB  - The following story offers a humble example of islands as natural laboratories,stressing the significance of insights gained from free-ranging animals in asomewhat simplified context. Two generous data-sharing populations ofpromiscuous sexually coercive Hermann’s tortoises (Testudo hermanni, a specieswith delayed maturity [~10 years]) from the Prespa Lake Region in Macedoniawere scrutinized. Comparisons between island (Golem Grad, divided intonarrow shores and a large plateau) and mainland (Konjsko) populations revealedage-specific life-history trends and behavioural peculiarities. The island contextbrought to attention very unusual demographic processes, eventually resonatingwith a seemingly inevitable population doom brought upon by insufferablesexual conflict.Neonates to three-year old tortoises exhibit slow growth and low variationin body size (VBS) among individuals, likely illustrating the impact of a soft shelland lack of parental care. The subsequent gradual approach of a survival plateau(annual survival rate increase: 0.30 to 0.70) parallels a gradual increase inconfidence and a slowly hardening shell that promotes better foragingcapabilities reflected onto a phase of fast linear growth. Unlike long-livedmammals that are in a hurry to reach maturity at a certain size (lowering VBS)that will increase survival and ensure reproduction during a non-growing adultphase, tortoises have the potential for indeterminate growth (estimatedindividual asymptotic sizes from incremental growth after maturity on GolemGrad range from ~153 to ~224). When protected by a hard carapace thattranslates into a survival plateau (0.90) at the age of five, indeterminate growthleaves room for young tortoises to express individuality in growth regimes,promoting an ever increasing VBS prior to adulthood. Size-at-maturity is thus ablurred notion in these tortoises. Testosterone levels and sexual activity indicatethat minimal size at maturity in precocious males is somewhere between 115-120mm straight carapace length (SCL), whereas VBS and literature point to arange of 140-150mm. Clearly some tortoises mature early, while others are in norush at all. Sexual size dimorphism in the Testudo genus suggests most larger-atmaturitytortoises are likely females; Golem Grad population-mean femaleasymptotic size estimates make no exception.Nevertheless, actual body sizes on the island do not reflect estimates fromincremental growth – the largest individuals are males. At ~100 individuals/hawith an operational sex ratio (OSR [♂/♀]) of ~11, male sexual coercion fromconstantly aroused tortoises drastically increased female mating costs, wreakinghavoc on Golem Grad. Adult survival estimates are considerably higher in males(0.97) than in females (0.84). This is accompanied with low female bodycondition,intense cloacal injuries inflicted by males, that can even push femalesfrom the island’s high cliffs. Overall, island females do not live long and are alsodiscouraged from reproduction (dissections data). Even implementing species'average fecundity, simulations predict recruitment insufficiency and a decline inthe number of females, exacerbating OSR-bias. Tortoises are long-lived animals;adult cohorts ensure population growth despite environmental fluctuations.Nevertheless, on the island the temporal-variance of adult female survival hassuccumbed to the pressure stirred up by male sexual coercion and will likely leadto population extinction. Perhaps most surprisingly, cloacal injuries indicate thateven immature females (~8 years old) have become the target of the maladaptivesexual appetite of males. After reaching nine years, females that inhabit theisland’s macho Plateau (only 5% of adults are females) are harassed and exhibitlower average annual survival probabilities.This unfortunate demographic drift does not seem to be the onlyconsequence of OSR bias and high density – island frustrated males court andmount other males more frequently than females. They even exhibit extravagantsexual behaviours, attempting to copulate with dead conspecifics, empty shells,and stones. Golem Grad tortoises elucidated the first natural example of a“prison effect,” whereby a high population density combined with femaledeprivation (but not accompanied with abnormal testosterone levels) triggeredsame-sex sexual behaviours (SSB) as a mere outlet of sexual stimulation. Moregenerally, this supports the hypothesis that SSB can be a nonadaptiveconsequence of unusual proximate factors rather than reflecting physiologicaldisorders. Finally, SSB may even benefit females by diluting aggressive malemounting efforts among males as well.In light of the expensive conservation endeavours on the endangeredHermann’s tortoises in western Europe, life-history insight gained from GolemGrad tortoises can provide a valuable conservation lesson: taking into accountHermann’s tortoises’ environmental sex determination, captive breedingprograms can easily create dense female biased colonies that will stand the bestchance of creating a prosperous breeding population in the shortest time. Suchvaluable advice can reduce conservation costs, and help reverse the artificialseparation of fundamental research from conservation, particularly evident inthe developing (e.g. Macedonia) and third world. After all, applied conservationshould only be the inevitable and likely unavoidable side-effect of research,rather than a short term must!

AB  - Hermann's tortoise ( Eurotestudo hermanni ) from a mesic area of Central Italy (Isernia, Molise) was investigated during a two-year period (2003-2004). The population is characterized by a fairly high density when compared to other Italian and European populations, with density ranging from 16.16 individuals/ha in 2003 to 25.08 individuals/ha in 2004 (average density 20.84/ha). The sex ratio was 1:1 both in 2003 and 2004. Females were captured in higher percentages from May to July in both years, while males were most abundant from August to October. These differences can be related to the different needs and behaviour of males and females in the two periods, and to the environmental constraints of the study area. All the marked tortoises were found aged between 10 and 21 years. Adult males and females from the study area were small-sized when compared to those from other Italian and European populations.

AB  - The prevalence of Salmonella infection was determined in a group of spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) seized during two smuggling attempts and in a population of captive Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) sheltered in a wildlife rescue centre. Salmonella spp. was isolated in 81 of 220 (36.8%) and in 17 of 67 (25.4%) cloacal swabs collected from the T. graeca and T. hermanni tortoises respectively. Overall, a total of 21 different Salmonella serotypes were found. Some of these serotypes are common to terrestrial chelonians while others have never been reported. All cultured serotypes were non-typhoidal but nonetheless many of these have been previously reported as source of human outbreaks of reptile-related salmonellosis. Eighty-two per cent and 5.3% of the isolates were resistant to two and three anti-microbial agents respectively. However, the isolates were highly susceptible to the anti-microbials of choice for the treatment of salmonellosis such as cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. Our findings confirm that tortoises can be considered a reservoir for Salmonella and that care should be employed when handling and breeding these animals. Tight surveillance should be enforced to avoid illegal importation and prevent the trading of live tortoises, carriers of zoonotic pathogens.

AB  - Illegal trade is threatening tortoise populations worldwide since decades. Nowadays, however, DNA typing and forensic genetic approaches allow to investigate geographic origin of confiscated animals and to relocate them into the wild, provided that suitable molecular tools and reference data are available. Here we assess the suitability of a small panel of microsatellite markers to investigate patterns of illegal translocations and to assist forensic genetic applications in the endangered Mediterranean land tortoise Testudo hermanni hermanni. We used the microsatellite panel to (i) increase the understanding of the population genetic structure in wild populations with new data from previously unsampled geographic areas (overall 461 wild individuals from 28 sampling sites); (ii) detect the presence of non-native individuals in wild populations; and (iii) identify the most likely geographic area of origin of 458 confiscated individuals hosted in Italian seizure and recovery centers. Our analysis initially identified six major genetic clusters corresponding to different geographic macro-areas along the Mediterranean range. Long-distance migrants among wild populations, due to translocations, were found and removed from the reference database. Assignment tests allowed us to allocate approximately 70% of confiscated individuals of unknown origin to one of the six Mediterranean macro-areas. Most of the assigned tortoises belonged to the genetic cluster corresponding to the area where the respective captivity center was located. However, we also found evidence of long-distance origin of confiscated individuals, especially in centers along the Adriatic coast and facing the Balkan regions, a well-known source of illegally traded individuals. Our results clearly show the role for reintroduction projects of the microsatellite panel, which was useful to re-assign most of the confiscated individuals to the respective macro-area of origin. At the same time, the microsatellite panel can assist future forensic genetic applications to detect illegal trade and possess of Testudo hermanni individuals.

AB  - In Mediterranean regions, fires threaten terrestrial tortoises. Nevertheless, varying proportions of adults survive fire; these surviving individuals can play a central role for population recovery. The regions devastated by fire often include important habitat of Hermann’s tortoises (Testudo hermanni hermanni), so assessing the ability of survivors to persist is essential for conserving the species. Body-condition indices provide an integrative estimate of how well individuals cope with environmental variations and impacts, including fires. Between 2002 and 2009, we monitored Hermann’s tortoises in intact and burnt habi tats in southeastern France. In summer 2003, a strong fire ravaged half of the surveyed zone, providing an opportunity to compare body condition of tortoises between intact and burnt areas over time. Six years later, the impact of fire on vegetation was still marked; large trees were abundant in the intact area, whereas open shrub vegetation prevailed in the burnt area. In both areas, the mean body condition of tortoises fluctuated over time; however, there were no differences between the two areas. A radio-tracking experiment demonstrated that individuals from each area were residents, and not vagrants commuting between areas. We also assessed changes in body condition and microhabitat use in radio-tracked individuals. We found no significant differences between the tortoises living in the burnt and intact areas, despite subtle differences in habitat use. In conclusion: (i) surviving tortoises in an area ravaged by fire can maintain their body condition like individuals living in an intact area, and thus, individuals from burnt areas should not be translocated to supposedly better areas; and (ii) depopulated burnt areas are likely to be appropriate for population-augmentation programmes.

AB  - The successful replication of a viral agent in a host is a complex process that often leads to a species specificity of the virus and can make interspecies transmission difficult. Despite this difficulty, natural host switch seems to have been frequent among viruses of lower vertebrates, especially fish viruses, since there are several viruses known to be able to infect a wide range of species. In the present review we will focus on well documented reports of broad host range, variations in host specificity, and host shift events hypothesized for viruses within the genera Ranavirus, Novirhabdovirus, Betanodavirus, Isavirus, and some herpesvirus.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Long-term ecological studies are important for understanding wild populations’ dynamics and processes and the actual factors that can determine their decline. Here, we report the results of a 28-years-long (1992–2019) monitoring of three distinct populations of a tortoise, <jats:italic>Testudo hermanni</jats:italic>, in Central Italy, with an emphasis on their population abundance trends and on the eventual variation in their habitat use across years and among the study areas. Samplings were conducted by Visual Encounter Survey (VES) methodology, and using a suite of statistical analyses including correlations and Generalized Linear Models analyses. Our data showed a statistically significant decline in tortoise sightings through time, and concurrently also a variation in habitat use by tortoises. In all the three study areas, we observed a significant increase of tortoise sighting frequency in the habitat type characterized by high (&gt;taller than 200 cm) shrubby and wooded vegetation. Since our analyses revealed no significant change in the habitat type availability by year in each study area, we suggest that <jats:italic>T. hermanni</jats:italic> was increasingly selecting closed vegetation spots throughout the years. We hypothesize that this observed trend of shift in habitat selection could be due to lowering their body temperatures to prevent overheating. So, the selection of more covered spots would be a thermal ecology adaptive consequence of the ongoing global warming.</jats:p>

AB  - Three rare geoemydid turtles described from Chinese trade specimens in the early 1990s, Ocadia glyphistoma, O. philippeni, and Sacalia pseudocellata, are suspected to be hybrids because they are known only from their original descriptions and because they have morphologies intermediate between other, better-known species. We cloned the alleles of a bi-parentally inherited nuclear intron from samples of these three species. The two aligned parental alleles of O. glyphistoma, O. philippeni, and S. pseudocellata have 5–11.5 times more heterozygous positions than do 13 other geoemydid species. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the two alleles from each turtle are strongly paraphyletic, but correctly match sequences of other species that were hypothesized from morphology to be their parental species. We conclude that these rare turtles represent recent hybrids rather than valid species. Specifically, “O. glyphistoma” is a hybrid of Mauremys sinensis and M.␣cf. annamensis, “O.␣philippeni” is a hybrid of M. sinensis and Cuora trifasciata, and “S. pseudocellata” is a hybrid of C. trifasciata and S. quadriocellata. Conservation resources are better directed toward finding and protecting populations of other rare Southeast Asian turtles that do represent distinct evolutionary lineages.

AB  - The idea that the size of animal populations may be regulated by factors intrinsic to them, such as behaviour, has a long history in ecology. Although this idea is now rejected as a general mechanism, it may apply in some species where females are damaged during courtship attempts, such as the Mediterranean tortoise Testudo hermanni. The sex ratios (adult males: adult females) of most dense Greek populations were more extreme (over 1.5:1) than could be accounted for by the earlier age at maturity of males, and some ranged to over 6:1. The sex ratio was correlated with the population density of adult males and the frequency of courtship attempts on females, and negatively correlated with the longevity of females. A high population density of males limits the density of adult females. This intrinsic regulation of population size is a consequence, rather than a goal, of a particular type of courtship behaviour (persistent thrusts by the male using a tail with a sharp terminal spur) in T. hermanni. Existing population densities at many Greek sites are probably unnaturally high, owing to the reduction of natural predators.

AB  - Because they have high longevity and a weak dispersal capacity, chelonians are known to be highly impacted by fire. We investigated the immediate demographic consequences of a wildfire occurring in 2009 on a population of Hermann's tortoises Testudo hermanni in the Plaine des Maures in southeastern France using the multistate capture–recapture method. Over two years (2009 and 2010), 108 adult individuals were marked. Survival probability was higher in the unburned (0.99) than in the burned area (0.43). The inter-annual transition probability from the burned to the unburned area was high (0.72). These results show that fire affects survival by immediately killing individuals and by inducing small-scale movements from burned to unburned areas.

AB  - In free-ranging reptile populations, bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic pathogens may affect hosts through impairment in movements, thermoregulation, reproduction, survival, and population dynamics. The speckled dwarf tortoise (Chersobius [Homopus] signatus) is a threatened species that is mostly restricted to the Succulent Karoo biome in South Africa, and little information on pathogens of this species is available yet. We derived baseline parameters for five males and five females that were captured to genetically enhance a conservation breeding program in Europe. Upon collection of the tortoises, ticks were removed and identified. Immediately upon arrival in Europe, ocular, nasal, oral and cloacal swabs were taken for viral, bacteriological and mycological examinations. Fecal samples were collected before and 1 month after fenbendazole treatment, and analyzed for parasites. A panel of PCR, aiming to detect herpesviruses, adenoviruses and iridoviruses, was carried out. Samples were negative for viruses, while bacteriological examination yielded detectable growth in 82.5% of the swabs with a mean load of 16 × 107 ± 61 × 108 colony forming units (CFU) per swab, representing 34 bacterial species. Cloacal and oral swabs yielded higher detectable growth loads than nasal and ocular swabs, but no differences between sexes were observed. Fungi and yeasts (mean load 5 × 103 ± 13 × 103 CFU/swab) were detected in 25% of the swabs. All pre-treatment fecal samples were positive for oxyurid eggs, ranging from 200 to 2400 eggs per gram of feces, whereas after the treatment a significantly reduced egg count (90–100% reduction) was found in seven out of 10 individuals. One remaining individual showed 29% reduction, and two others had increased egg counts. In five tortoises, Nycthocterus spp. and coccidian oocysts were also identified. Soft ticks were identified as Ornithodoros savignyi. Our baseline data from clinically healthy individuals will help future studies to interpret prevalences of microorganisms in speckled dwarf tortoise populations. The study population did not appear immediately threatened by current parasite presence.

AB  - Abstract Road-kill can lead to a sharp local decline of herpetofauna species. For this reason, transportation agencies are more and more interested to implement mitigation measures in order to eliminate this threat. The present study proposes to identify the railroad network induced threats at a railroad segment spatial scale on Getic Tableland, south-western Romania, by highlighting associated mortality hot spots for Testudo hermanni boettgeri. The railroad segment was chosen due to the reported road-kills and high traffic volume. In order to identify road associated mortality hot spots, we adapted a gravity model by including a weighting coefficient for overtaking obstacles. The model was adapted after observing that the cuts, fills, ditches and guardrails can change the tortoises behavior, making them avoid dangerous crossings, thus influencing the distribution of hot spots. As a main result, our study managed to adapt a gravity model for a more accurate assessment of railroad associated mortality. The average value of inter-habitat interaction is reduced by 23.37% after introducing the coefficient of overtaking the obstacles. However, despite the numerous obstacles, at a home range spatial scale, the maximum inter-habitat interaction value is not decreased, the range being stable (range = 0 - 99.66). Instead, the spatial extent of the hot spots is modified because of the increased territorial dependence and home range multi-annual stability, both severely threatening the tortoise that have a home range bisected by a major railroad. Our study accurately identifies the hot spots, which is particularly important in planning mitigation efforts, for building effective underpasses and fences systems.

AB  - Personality traits, defined as differences in the behavior of individual animals of the same species that are consistent over time and context, such as ‘boldness,’ have been shown to be both heritable and be influenced by external factors, such as predation pressure. Currently, we know very little about the role that early environmental factors have upon personality. Thus, we investigated the impact of incubation temperature upon the boldness on an oviparous reptile, the bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps). Eggs, from one clutch, were incubated at two different average temperatures within the normal range. After hatching the lizards were raised under the same environmental conditions. Novel object and novel environment tests were used to assess personality. Each test was repeated in both the short term and the long term. The results revealed that incubation temperature did impact upon ‘boldness’ but only in the short term and suggests that, rather than influencing personality, incubation temperature may have an effect on the development of behavioral of oviparous reptiles at different stages across ontogeny.

AB  - Sperm storage is widespread in many vertebrate groups, and it is frequently associated with promiscuous mating systems. Chelonian species are one of the most outstanding examples of a promiscuous group capable of long-term sperm storage; specialized structures have evolved within the oviducts of these vertebrates to ensure sperm vitality across reproductive cycles. Thus far, few studies have investigated the factors regulating multiple paternity, sperm usage by females and paternity distribution in successive clutches. This study aimed to investigate the effect of mating order on male mounting and reproductive success in Testudo hermanni hermanni, combining behavioural and genetic data. A series of planned matings were performed, within which experimental females were mated sequentially to two different males under controlled conditions. Observations conducted during experimental matings revealed that courtship displays did not significantly differ between the first and second males to mate with a female. Interactions ending with a mount were characterized by a significantly higher intensity and occurrence of determinate courtship behaviours, for example biting and running after the female. Paternity analysis performed on hatchlings produced from experimental females revealed that 46 % of the clutches were multi-sired. A significant contribution of previous years' partners was still found, thus confirming the long-term sperm storage within the female oviduct in this species. Finally, mating order did not significantly affect the reproductive success of experimental males during the on-going reproductive season.

AB  - Testudines show phenotypic plasticity, and variation among specific populations within a species is widespread. Morphological differences between populations may reflect ecological factors that drive adaptation to local conditions. In this context, we gathered basic data on the morphology of the Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni boettgeri Mojsisovits, 1889) to document their variation across different geographical regions. We surveyed Hermann's tortoises in five different locales within Albania during April and May 2020 and measured 20 morphological characteristics, including carapace and plastron dimensions. We measured 188 tortoises (81 males, 107 females) in this study, and females were larger (p = 0.0001) and heavier (p = 0.0001) than males. Mean straight carapace length (SCL) and body mass were 172.4 mm and 1128.8 g, respectively, for females, and 151.3 mm and 735 g, respectively, for males. The Albanian T. h. boettgeri were regionally diverged into three different populations that were situated in northern (Shkodra), central (Tirana, Berati, and Ballshi), and southern (Saranda) Albania. The body size (curved carapace length (CCL)) of females was positively correlated (r = 0.216; p = 0.025) with the latitude, in accordance with Bergmann's rule. However, there was no correlation between body size and latitude in males. These striking regional differences among Albanian T. h. boettgeri strongly suggest that further study of molecular variations and reproductive output of Hermann's tortoises is warranted.

AB  - Abstract Herbivory is the dominant feeding strategy in tortoises, and dietary shifts are common in response to changes in resource availability. We conducted the first large-scale study of the diets of wild Hermann's Tortoises (Testudo hermanni hermanni) and found that the study population in central Italy was strictly herbivorous. The tortoises ate primarily legume leaves and grasses in the spring, and switched to flowers and unripe fruit of Ruscus aculeatus as these became available in the autumn. There were no significant differences between the diets of males and females. Although tortoise diets included both rare and abundant plant species, they consumed abundant plant species in a higher proportion than those species occurred in the study area. However, some rare plants made up relatively large fractions of the diet, and one of the few nonnative plants (Conyza canadensis) at the study area was eaten frequently by tortoises in all seasons, despite its relative rarity. Ruscus aculeatus berries may be ...

AB  - Energetic aspects of female reproduction are described for the tortoises Testudo graeca, Testudo marginata, and Testudo hermanni (three populations of different body size) from northern Greece. Egg width increased with body size in some populations, but smaller individuals produced more elongate eggs, and egg weight was not related to body size. This method for overcoming the constraint of the width of the pelvic canal means that egg width is a poor measure of egg size. Clutch size, clutch mass, and annual egg production varied with body size between populations. Mean relative clutch mass ranged from 4 to 7%, and was highest in the three populations of T. hermanni. All populations laid two or three clutches per year, based on the total number of eggs and large follicles divided by clutch size. Multiple clutches reflect the morphological constraint of packing shelled eggs within the body, rather than energy accumulation during the nesting period. Material for reproduction was stored in growing follicles ra...

AB  - The current distribution of the Hermann's tortoise, Testudo hermanni (Gmelin, 1789), in Italy is very scattered. Most of populations occur along the Thyrrhenian coast, particularly southern Tuscany, and Latium, where the most high density was observed. Other populations, probably autochthonous, can be found in Campania and in Calabria. Along the Adriatic coast, the biggest populations can be found in Apulia, Abruzzo and Molise. The species also occurs in some sites of Sicily and Sardinia. In the northern Italy, the Hermann's tortoise has almost disappeared and can be found only in the Po River Delta, such as the Bosco della Mesola. Sites are mainly located in the coasts but, in some cases, also in the inland up to mountains slopes. Further sightings in other areas concerned isolated individuals probably released from captivity. In the present paper the results of a population study carried out in the Bosco della Mesola Reserve, are discussed. The population structure is dominated by adults over 20 years old. The home range size was larger for the females than for the males. Longer daily distances were covered in spring and summer, while movements were greatly reduced during post and prehibernation periods. Conservation strategies should be based on: (1) verifying the taxonomic status and the origin of the Italian population through the analysis of genetic distances; (2) monitoring all the major populations in order to assess their status and dynamics; (3) establishing new protected areas in Mediterranean coastal habitats, to protect autochthonous populations and increase population density in case of low numbers. In order to increase the reproductive success of the Hermann's tortoise within protected areas, enclosures should be set out where to raise pairs of breeders. Young turtles should be released in core areas of the reserves, without anthropic disturbance. Moreover, the sites where females laid eggs should be fenced by wire net, in order to prevent predation up to the hatching. The goal is to create a pool of specimens useful for reintroduction and restocking.

AB  - Despite exhibiting low velocity and limited agility, many tortoises undertake large scale movements and must overcome various obstacles, notably in populations living in hilly or rocky habitats. Although crucial, studies exploring how tortoises move in complex and irregular environments are scarce. In this context, we examined an important behavioural trait: how tortoises (Testudo hermanni) deal with step-like obstacles. In their natural habitat, individuals were positioned in a challenging situation: they were placed on a bench approximately 50 cm high, and were observed over a 10-min period. We compared the behaviour of the tortoises (taking a risk to ‘jump’ or waiting) from two populations living in contrasted habitats: flat versus rugged (crisscrossed by cliffs and rocky steps). Individuals from the flat habitat were reluctant to jump, whereas most tortoises from the rugged habitat jumped. Immature tortoises were less willing to jump compared to larger and more experienced adults. These results suggest that challenging habitats increase boldness. In addition to fundamental findings, these results may have conservation value and assist in improving translocation strategies for endangered tortoise populations. © 2013 The Linnean Society of London

AB  - In a population of about 130 tortoises, consisting mainly of Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) and Four-toed tortoises (Agrionemys horsfieldii), 50% of the reptiles died within 3 months in autumn 1987. Post mortem analysis of 5 necropsied turtles revealed thick, caseous coatings in the upper digestive tract, hepatomegaly and enteritis. By microbiological examination a lot of ubiquitous bacteria could be isolated. By electron microscopy of concentrated and negatively stained gut specimens herpes virus particles were found in two Hermann's tortoises and one Four-toed tortoise. Isolation experiments in embryonic turtle tissue cultures showed no evidence of a cytopathogenic agent. The results are discussed in respect of their importance for the high mortality observed in the population of mediterranean land turtles.

AB  - Abstract International conventions dictate reliable identification of various reptile species that are subject to intensive trade targeting and habitat destruction. As a rule, tortoises with a minimal plastron length of 100 mm are fitted with a microchip transponder. The development of new generations of transponders, however, may offer the possibility to identify smaller individuals. This study evaluated the use of microchip transponders in juvenile Hermann's tortoises, Testudo hermanni, by using two groups of 30 captive-bred tortoises. Microchip transponders were implanted in the first group of tortoises, and the second group served as a control group. During a 10 month observation period, including 2 months of hibernation, both groups were evaluated for short- as well as mid-term effects of microchip implantation, and readability of the microchips was checked twice a week. Body weight and plastron length were determined twice a week to compare growth and weight curves between both groups. Radiographs w...

Three divergent haplotypes were observed, regionally corresponding to the north‐western (<jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">HI</jats:styled-content>), south‐western (<jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">HII</jats:styled-content>) and Peloponnese (<jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">HIII</jats:styled-content>) areas of Greece. In both females and males, haplotypes <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">HI</jats:styled-content> and <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">HII</jats:styled-content> showed the lack of plastral shape divergence, but were both statistically significantly different relative to <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">HIII</jats:styled-content> found in Peloponnese. The Peloponnesian populations (<jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">HIII</jats:styled-content>) had longer bridges and the wider and shorter anterior part of the plastron, relative to populations from the mainland Greece (<jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">HI</jats:styled-content> and <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">HII</jats:styled-content>). Hence, both morphological and molecular markers suggested Peloponnese as a distinct lineage in relation to mainland populations. Finally, we consider geometric morphometrics as an efficient method to detect and characterize subtle interpopulation differences.

AB  - Climatic shifts may increase the extinction risk of populations, especially when they are already suffering from other anthropogenic impacts. Our ability to predict the consequences of climate change on endangered species is limited by our scarce knowledge of the effects of climate variability on the population dynamics of most organisms and by the uncertainty of climate projections, which depend strongly on the region of the earth being considered. In this study, we analysed a long-term monitoring programme (1988–2009) of Hermann’s tortoise (Testudo hermanni) aimed at evaluating the consequences of the drastic changes in temperature and precipitation patterns predicted for the Mediterranean region on the demography of a long-lived species with low dispersal capability and already suffering a large number of threats. Capture–recapture modelling of a population in the Ebro Delta (NE Spain) allowed us to assess the effect of climate variability on the survival of tortoises. Winter rainfall was found to be the major driver of juvenile and immature survival, whereas that of adults remained high and constant across the study. Furthermore, local climate series obtained ad hoc from regional climate simulations, for this and 10 additional Mediterranean locations where tortoises occurred, provided us with reliable future climate forecasts, which were used to simulate the fate of these populations under three precipitation scenarios (mean, wet and dry) using stochastic population modelling. We show that a shift to a more arid climate would have negative consequences for population persistence, enhancing juvenile mortality and increasing quasiextinction risk because of a decrease in recruitment. These processes varied depending on the population and the climate scenario we considered, but our results suggest that unless other human-induced causes of mortality are suppressed (e.g. poaching, fire, habitat fragmentation), climate variability will increase extinction risk within most of the species’ current range.

AB  - Two types of pathogens cause highly contagious upper respiratory tract diseases (URTD) in Chelonians: testudinid herpesviruses (TeHV) and a mycoplasma (Mycoplasma agassizii). In captivity, these infections are frequent and can provoke outbreaks. Pet trade generates international flow of tortoises, often without sanitary checking; individuals intentionally or accidentally released in the wild may spread pathogens. A better understanding of the transmission of infectious agents from captivity to wild tortoises is needed. Many exotic individuals have been introduced in populations of the endangered western Hermann s tortoise (Testudo hermanni hermanni), notably spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca). We assessed the presence of TeHV and mycoplasma in native western Hermann s tortoises and in potential pet vectors in south-eastern France. Using a large sample (N=572 tortoises), this study revealed the worrying presence of herpesvirus in 7 free-ranging individuals (3 sub-populations). Additionally, Mycoplasma agassizii was detected in 15 of the 18 populations sampled with a frequency ranging from 3.4% (1 of 29 tortoises) to 25% (3 of 12 tortoises) 23.5 4 (1/29 tested) to 25 (3/12)%.. Exotic spur-thighed tortoises showed high frequency of mMycoplasma infection in captivity (18.2%) and in individuals (50%) found in native Hermann s tortoise sub-populations, suggesting that this species could be a significant vector. The paucity of information of TeHV on European tortoise URTD in natural settings, especially in combination with mycoplasma, prompts for further studies. Indeed, sick tortoises remain concealed and may not be easily detected in the field. Our results indicate that both the prevalence and health impact of URTD are high and should be scrutinized in the field.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
				<jats:p>Testudo graeca is one of the two species of tortoises from Romania, the other one being Testudo hermanni. It is well known that this species has a broad but fragmented distribution range and this fact labels this species as Vulnerable in the IUCN Red List. The population of Testudo graeca ibera from the Natura 2000 site “Marine dunes from Agigea” is characterized by a high percentage of injuries (84%) from the total of 43 individuals found alive. A high percentage of individuals have injuries on all the plates from carapace and plastron. All lesions appear to be chronic, suggesting that there is a series of predisposing factors, such as: inadequate terrain (concrete, metal, broken glass and other hard objects), high-density dog population and coprophagia, which could be a sign of unbalanced nutrition. This is the first report of a population of Testudo graeca which has such a high percentage of individuals with shell damage.</jats:p>

AB  - Ranaviral disease in amphibians has been studied intensely during the last decade, as associated mass-mortality events are considered to be a global threat to wild animal populations. Several studies have also included other susceptible ectothermic vertebrates (fish and reptiles), but only very few cases of ranavirus infections in lizards have been previously detected. In this study, we focused on clinically suspicious lizards and tested these animals for the presence of ranaviruses. Virological screening of samples from lizards with increased mortality and skin lesions over a course of four years led to the detection of ranaviral infections in seven different groups. Affected species were: brown anoles (Anolis sagrei), Asian glass lizards (Dopasia gracilis), green anoles (Anolis carolinensis), green iguanas (Iguana iguana), and a central bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps). Purulent to ulcerative-necrotizing dermatitis and hyperkeratosis were diagnosed in pathological examinations. All animals tested positive for the presence of ranavirus by PCR and a part of the major capsid protein (MCP) gene of each virus was sequenced. Three different ranaviruses were isolated in cell culture. The analyzed portions of the MCP gene from each of the five different viruses detected were distinct from one another and were 98.4-100% identical to the corresponding portion of the frog virus 3 (FV3) genome. This is the first description of ranavirus infections in these five lizard species. The similarity in the pathological lesions observed in these different cases indicates that ranaviral infection may be an important differential diagnosis for skin lesions in lizards.

AB  - Phalangeal reduction is a common and widespread phenomenon among tortoises that has been associated with the adaptation to terrestrial life. While reduced manual digit 1 appears characteristic in almost all Testudo species, it is uncertain why the metacarpal I and distal carpal of the same digit are completely missing in some individuals of Hermann’s tortoise (Testudo hermanni hermanni). To clarify this issue, we investigated the number of manual claws in six populations of Hermann’s tortoise (one from the Ebro Delta in the Iberian Peninsula and five from Minorca Island), their age, sex, genetic lineage, and the substrate type that they inhabit. The number of claws was ascertained based on direct counts (n > 1500 individuals) and by X-rays (n = 32 individuals), obtaining three different phalangeal formulae: (1-2-2-2-1, D-2-2-2-1, 0-2-2-2-1). Thus, claw counts through both methodologies (direct count and X-ray) further confirm that the observed claws serve as a good proxy to assess the actual number of digits. Our results show no loss of phalanges, metacarpal and carpal bones in digit 1 associated with age, sex, or substrate, contrary to some previous authors who hypothesized a relationship between this loss and sexual dimorphism. Therefore, variations in the number of manual digits and the loss of metacarpal I and distal carpal in digit 1 in Hermann’s tortoise are related to population and genetic lineage. More detailed comparisons with other Testudo hermanni populations from elsewhere in Europe would be required to understand the evolutionary significance concerning the intrapopulation variability in the number of digits remaining.

AB  - SUMMARY The tortoise Testudo hermanni Gmelin (Reptilia Testudinidae) has a very stable home range to which it returns after experimental displacement. This paper aims at isolating those motion parameters in the short-term movement patterns of the animals, which are responsible for the antidispersive character of their long-term spatial activity. The study is based on the radiotracking of 15 adult tortoises over a year, and computer simulation. Four Monte Carlo simulations were built: a day-by-day model of antidispersive patterns, a boundary model, a simulation based on movements biased toward a constant centre, and a model including the short-term resetting of the activity centre. The outputs of the fourth model best fit the empirical data on dispersion, obtained by a long-term capture-recapture study of the same population. These tortoises actively reduce dispersion over time by performing short-term centrally biased movements toward a core area which may vary in time, depending on the interactions betwe...

AB  - <jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Assigning individuals to their source populations is crucial for conservation research, especially for endangered species threatened by illegal trade and translocations. Genetic assignment can be achieved with different types of molecular markers, but technical advantages and cost saving are recently promoting the shift from short tandem repeats (STRs) to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Here, we designed, developed, and tested a small panel of SNPs for cost-effective geographic assignment of individuals with unknown origin of the endangered Mediterranean tortoise <jats:italic>Testudo hermanni</jats:italic>. We started by performing a ddRAD-seq experiment on 70 wild individuals of <jats:italic>T. hermanni</jats:italic> from 38 locations. Results obtained using 3,182 SNPs are comparable to those previously obtained using STR markers in terms of genetic structure and power to identify the macro-area of origin. However, our SNPs revealed further insights into the substructure in Western populations, especially in Southern Italy. A small panel of highly informative SNPs was then selected and tested by genotyping 190 individuals using the KASP genotyping chemistry. All the samples from wild populations of known geographic origin were genetically re-assigned with high accuracy to the original population. This reduced SNPs panel represents an efficient molecular tool that enables individuals to be genotyped at low cost (less than €15 per sample) for geographical assignment and identification of hybrids. This information is crucial for the management in-situ of confiscated animals and their possible re-allocation in the wild. Our methodological pipeline can easily be extended to other species.</jats:p>

AB  - An acceptable agreement permits interchangeability of the instruments. For this purpose, we have investigated the agreement of several clinical instruments frequently used in clinical practice with their laboratory counterpart. We have estimated the agreement between a point-of-care blood gas analyzer (i-Stat, Abaxis) and a bench-top blood gas analyzer (Nova, Biomedical) in venous samples from Hermann’s tortoises. We have estimated the agreement between a point-of-care chemistry analyzer (VetScan VS2, Abaxis) and a laboratory analyzer (Olympus AU400, Olympus Co.) in venous samples from Hermann’s tortoises. We have estimated the agreement between portable blood glucose meters (Accu-Chek, Aviva; AlphaTrak 2, Abbott) and a laboratory analyzer (Dimension EXL, Siemens) in venous samples from client-owned rabbits. We have estimated the agreement between point-of-care bench-top glucose measurement (VetScan VS2, Abaxis) and a laboratory analyzer (Dimension EXL, Siemens) in venous samples from client-owned rabbits. 
Beyond method comparison and validation, reference interval determination for common laboratory testing is required to allow the clinician to discriminate individuals that are different from the remaining population for a certain parameter. We have calculated reference intervals for blood gas in Hermann’s tortoises. We have calculated reference intervals for protein electrophoresis in Hermann’s tortoises. We have described normal hematology in Hermann’s tortoises. We have calculated reference intervals for clinical chemistry in Hermann’s tortoises. We have calculated reference intervals for aldosterone in ferrets. Based on our results, animal species requires individual validation of laboratory methods and reference intervals. Lack of consideration of these findings may result in clinical misdiagnosis and improper treatment of animals.

Grâce à des suivis par radio-tracking menés sur l’ensemble de la saison d’activité, les domaines vitaux annuels de 165 Tortues d’Hermann (Testudo hermanni Gmelin, 1789) provenant de neuf sous-populations de France continentale ont été obtenus par la méthode des polygones convexes minimum (MCP). Les grands domaines vitaux mesurés sur plusieurs populations contrastent avec les données précédemment publiées sur le sujet. Notre étude montre que le DV d’une Tortue d’Hermann occupe environ neuf hectares (valeur médiane 5,2 ha) alors que la valeur moyenne de référence pour les populations françaises n’est que de deux hectares. Cette différence s’explique par les petites tailles d’échantillons obtenus sur de courtes périodes des études précédentes. Les suivis intensifs menés pendant 10 ans fournissent une vision plus réaliste de la taille des domaines vitaux. En accord avec la littérature, une grande variabilité interindividuelle se traduit par des valeurs extrêmes, éloignées des DV (0,6 ha à 95,0 ha). Globalement, la taille des DV augmente au printemps lorsque l’activité des individus est la plus importante et se stabilise pendant la saison estivale, voire en automne. Il est essentiel que l’établissement de zones de protection et de corridors prenne en compte ces nouvelles données, tout particulièrement les valeurs maximales (&gt;15 ha). Seules les populations suffisamment grandes occupant des habitats diversifiés pourront s’adapter aux changements globaux et aux changements climatiques notamment. Protéger de grandes surfaces si possible connectées par des infrastructures dédiées (e.g. passages sous les routes) est une condition pour avoir une diversité génétique importante et une diversité de micro-habitats suffisante.</jats:p>

AB  - To avoid the possible extinction of the last native population of western Hermann’s tortoise in the Iberian Peninsula it is essential to make sound management decisions. Knowledge of macro and microhabitat use and home range size has considerable practical value for land managers. With this aim we first studied the home range and habitat preferences in western Hermann’s tortoises by radio tracking 15 adults weekly from March 2008 to May 2009 in three localities within the Albera population range (NE Iberian Peninsula). We estimated home ranges with Fixed Kernel estimator (FK) and Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) after checking tortoise site fidelity. We observed that home range size did not differ significantly between males and females (mean FK = 2.01 ha, mean MCP = 3.01 ha). Secondly, we studied macrohabitat selection using a vegetation map. Preferred habitats were open shrubland, open forest and barren land during the activity period, and dense forest, dense shrubland and open shrubland during the hibernation. Next, we assessed microhabitat selection along five periods of the annual cycle: hibernation, emergence from hibernation, spring, summer and autumn. We then located marked tortoises weekly and classified the plant species observed in each location. Principal component analyses showed that tortoises selected shrubs with trees during hibernation, bramble during summer and herbaceous habitat during the breeding season. All these results can provide guidelines for management programs that set aside areas of habitat critical to conserve viable populations, although it is also important to prevent mortality from forestry works. We therefore tested a new brush cutter head accessory to achieve tortoise-safe undergrowth clearing. To this aim we distributed 52 frozen hybrid tortoises among eight plots of 100 m2, cleared six of these plots with the accessory and two without it, and evaluated the scars of the blade on caparaces. We observed no damage in plots that were cleared with the accessory but scars in most carapaces in the plots cleared without it (with potential mortality ranging from 40% in neonates to 100% in adults). These results outline the importance of supporting habitat management decisions with proper field studies.

AB  - This thesis examines clinically relevant
 haematological and biochemical parameters in healthy European tortoises
 including Testudo hermanni,
 Testudo graeca,
 Testudo marginata
 and Testudo horsfieldii.  A total of 180 blood samples were taken
 from 60 tortoises kept in Germany
 and analyzed during three seasons of the year (spring, summer and fall).
 Every animal
 underwent a general examination, was weighed and marked for identification
 prior to taking blood samples exclusively from the vena coccygealis dorsalis.
 Twenty-one
 blood parameters were examined: Alanine aminotransferase,  aspartate aminotransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase,
 alkaline phosphatase, creatine
 kinase, cholinesterase, uric acid, blood urea
 nitrogen (BUN), cholesterol, total bilirubin,
 glucose, fructosamine, total protein, albumin,
 sodium, chloride, total calcium, ionized calcium, phosphate, potassium and
 packed cell volume (PCV).  Few
 studies on glutamate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, sodium, chloride, ionized calcium and
 potassium in the European tortoises exist. Studies on cholinesterase and fructosamine are non-existent to date.
 The blood
 samples were statistically analyzed as a combined total of all samples taken
 as well as according to species, gender, age and season.
 For the tested population following mean
 values were found: Alanine aminotransferase
 1,2 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase
 25,7 U/L, glutamate dehydrogenase 1,6 U/L, alkaline
 phosphatase 287 U/L, creatine
 kinase 63,3 U/L, cholinesterase 220 U/L, uric acid
 2,9 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen 7,7 mg/dl, cholesterol 118,2 mg/dl, total bilirubin 0,03 mg/dl, glucose 79,4 mg/dl, fructosamine 116,9 µmol/L, total protein 3,45 g/dl,
 albumin 1,48 g/dl, sodium 130,7 mmol/L, chloride
 109,4 mmol/L, total calcium 3,25 mmol/L, ionized calcium 1,35 mmol/L,
 phosphate 0,88 mmol/L,  potassium 4,6 mmol/L,
 packed cell volume 24,2 %.
 Biostatistical analysis of examined parameters
 resulted in the following: Creatine kinase, cholinesterase, uric acid, fructosamine,
 sodium and chloride showed evidence of statistically significant
 differences depending on species among  European tortoises. Apart from this
 and depending on the species examined, differences with regard to packed cell
 volume, alanine aminotransferase,
 aspartate aminotransferase,
 alkaline phosphatase, urea, cholesterol, glucose,
 total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, ionized
 calcium and phosphate were demonstrated, although not to a statistically
 significant degree. Cholesterol, sodium and total calcium showed
 evidence of statistically significant gender specific differences. Aspartate aminotransferase,
 urea, total protein, albumin and chloride showed evidence of gender specific
 differences as well, but not statistically significant. Cholinesterase, however, showed a statistically
 significant age related disparity. Packed cell volume, aspartate aminotransferase,
 alkaline phosphatase, creatine
 kinase, cholesterol, glucose, total protein,
 sodium, chloride, ionized blood calcium, total calcium and phosphate also
 demonstrated differences but none of statistic relevance. Packed cell volume, alanine
 aminotransferase, aspartate
 aminotransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase,
 cholinesterase, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, sodium, chloride,
 phosphate and potassium showed statistically significant, seasonal differences.

AB  - The current distribution of the Hermann's tortoise, Testitelo hermanni (Gmelin, 1789), in Italy is very scattered. Most of populations occur along the Thyrrhenian coast, particularly southern Tuscany, and Latium, where the most high density was observed. Other populations, probably autochthonous, can be found in Campania and in Calabria. Along the Adriatic coast, the biggest populations can be found in Apulia, Abruzzo and Molise. The species also occurs in some sites of Sicily and Sardinia. In the northern Italy, the Hermann's tortoise has almost disappeared and can be found only in the Po River Delta, such as the Bosco della Mesola. Sites are mainly located in the coasts but, in some cases, also in the inland up to mountains slopes. Further sightings in other areas concerned isolated individuals probably released from captivity. In the present paper the results of a population study carried out in the Bosco della Mesola Reserve, are discussed. The population structure is dominated by adults over 20 years...

AB  - We describe the behavioral adaptations of a population of Hermann's tortoise to the climate of a northern sector of its range, and to a wooded biotope that is uncommon for the species. The activity, the home range, and the thermal relations along the daily and the yearly cycle are described. In contrast to other populations that have bimodal activity peaking in spring and in autumn, the tortoises in our study area had unimodal seasonal activity that can be related to lower summer temperatures. Home range size, 7.4 ha for females and 4.6 ha for males in our study area, was from three to seven times larger than that of all other populations. The large home range, and the low population density of the tortoises in our study area, may be due to food scarcity in the wooded habitat.

AB  - Understanding wildlife movements and habitat selection are critical to drafting conservation and manage- ment plans. We studied a population of eastern Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni boettgeri) in a traditionally man- aged rural landscape in Romania, near the northern edge of the species geographic distribution. We used telemetry to radio-track 24 individuals between 2005 and 2008 and performed a Euclidian distance-based habitat selection anal- ysis to investigate habitats preferred by tortoises at both landscapes (second-order order selection) and individual (third-order selection) home range scales. The home range size for tortoises in our study area was 3.79±0.62 ha and did not differ by gender or season (pre- and post-nesting sea- sons). Their movement ecology was characterized by short- distance movements (daily mean031.18±1.59 m), appar- ently unaffected by habitat type. In contrast to other studies, movements of males and females were of similar magni- tude. At the landscape (population home range) scale, grass- lands and shrubs were preferred, but tortoises also showed affinity to forest edges. At the individual home range scale, tortoises selected grassland and shrub habitats, avoided for- ests, and used forest edges randomly. Creeks were avoided at both spatial scales. Our results suggest that tortoise home ranges contain well-defined associations of habitats despite a higher selection for grasslands. As such, avoiding land conversion to other uses and maintaining habitat heteroge- neity through traditional practices (e.g., manual mowing of grasslands, livestock grazing) are critical for the persistence of tortoise populations.

AB  - Most species of tortoises are seriously threatened worldwide. Chelonians are long-lived organisms characterized by slow demographic traits; mathematical modeling estimated that a high rate of juvenile annual survival (i.e. > 0.6 on average) is essential for the persistence of populations. Unfortunately, current knowledge about free-ranging juveniles is fragmentary. Under field conditions, young tortoises are very secretive, they remain sheltered beneath bushes, and they escape capture. The resulting lack of information impairs the assessment of key parameters such as juvenile survival, habitat use, or recruitment rate and thus seriously impedes both accurate population viability analyses and conservation planning. Large-scale monitoring of different populations of a threatened species (Testudo hermanni hermanni) confirmed that juveniles are rarely seen in the field. In 2011, we placed corrugated fibrocement slabs as alternative refuges for small tortoises in a densely vegetated study site. Many juveniles sheltered under the space offered by the corrugations; consequently they were easily captured and recaptured. Our results suggest that this simple technique may significantly improve the detectability of juveniles, providing access to the life history traits of this otherwise elusive age cohort. The slabs also provide protection against predators (such as dogs and birds) which further suggests that these refuges may also improve the survival of the smallest and most vulnerable individuals.

Such studies are urgently needed because very little is known about the ecology of Mediterranean tortoises, which are declining seriously, due mainly to habitat loss and collecting for the pet trade. The expedition chose Alyki after an expedition by the same society in 1979 had reported an exceptionally rich wildlife there including a large tortoise population. A new holiday village nearby did not appear to threaten the main wildlife areas, and a commercial salt works only operated at the north end of the lake from which access to the heath was not easy. However, unknown to the four members, the 1980 expedition had walked into an explosive situation. The following account is quoted from their report.</jats:p>

AB  - Estimating the genetic variation and demographic trends of species in decline is of major concern in conservation genetics. This study contributes to understanding how historical and anthropogenic factors shape the distribution of current genetic diversity in one of the most endangered reptiles in Western Europe, the Hermann's tortoise Testudo hermanni hermanni. We used 17 microsatellite loci, chosen from a pyrosequencing library specifically developed for the subspecies to genotype eight populations distributed over about 30 sample localities covering almost the entire geographic distribution of the sub-species. The population genetic results reflect a very strong genetic structure and identify three major clusters among the Hermann's tortoise in the occidental Mediterranean basin: a continental cluster (Albera in Spain, Var in France and continental Italy), an insular cluster (Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily) and a cluster of mixed lineage (Minorca). Each of the eight studied populations is characterized by only one lineage except for Minorca, in which two lineages were identified. In contrast to what most empirical studies predict, the genetic diversity of the Hermann's tortoise is greater on islands than on the continent. Islands can therefore be considered as genetic sanctuaries with high conservation potential for this species, particularly in Corsica. Historical demographic patterns inferred with a generalized stepwise-mutation model (GSM) using maximum likelihood showed significant past demographic changes in only two of the eight sampled populations: a demographic bottleneck was detected in the Albera population (Spain) and a demographic expansion in Corsica (France). In contrast to what was argued in previous studies, these results indicate that the Hermann's tortoise lineage found in Corsica is autochthonous. The origin of both lineages found in Minorca remains speculative. Lastly, our study identifies the six most relevant management units (sensu Moritz, 1994) for conservation purposes on the basis that they represent a significant part of the evolutionary legacy of the species. Some conservation recommendations were proposed, in particular for the most threatened population in Albera.

In Spain, one comes across only a few in Mi- norca and Majorca (Balearic Is.) and in an area confined to the north of the province of Gerona. In France, it occurs in the Maures and Esterel mountains (Var), the Alberes (Pyrenees-orientales) and Corsica. The importance of the Italian populations is less understood. On the mainland, it is mainly on the west coast and in the south. It also occurs on the islands of Sicily, Sardinia and Elba. In all these areas, Hermann's tor- toise is in strong decline on account of forest fires, increased urbanisation of the coastal areas and com- mercial and individual collecting. Proper safeguards are extemely limited and will not allow populations of this tortoise to be maintained. Prompt action to safeguard the species is required. One of the most effec- tive means qould be to increase breeding in populations reduced by fire. The formation of nature reserves is also desirable to protect the small isolated populations of the Alberes, Maurea, Minorca and Mallorca.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">Hotspots of intraspecific genetic diversity represent invaluable resources for species to cope with environmental changes, and their identification is increasingly recognized as a major goal of conservation ecology research. However, even for iconic and endangered species, conservation strategies are often planned without thorough information on the geographic patterns of genetic variation. Here, we investigated the spatial patterns of genetic variation of the endangered Hermann's tortoise Testudo hermanni in the Italian Peninsula by genotyping 174 individuals at 7 microsatellite loci, with the aim to contribute to planning effective conservation strategies.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">Ordination-based and Bayesian clustering analyses consistently identified three main genetic clusters, one spread in the central and northern part of the peninsula, and two restricted to southern Italy and Sicily, respectively. The highest levels of genetic diversity were found in populations of the southern cluster and, in particular, at the northern edges of its distribution (He &amp;gt; 0.6, Ar &amp;gt; 2.8 ), that correspond to areas of putative secondary contact and admixture between distinct lineages. Our results clearly identify a hotspot of genetic diversity for the Hermann's tortoise in southern Italy.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION">We inferred the evolutionary history and the spatial patterns of genetic variation of the Hermann's tortoise in the Italian Peninsula. We identified three main genetic clusters along the peninsula and a hotspot of intraspecific diversity in southern Italy. Our results underline the urgent need for conservation actions to warrant the long-term persistence of viable tortoise populations in this area. Furthrmore, these data add further evidence to the role of southern Italy as a biodiversity hotspot for temperate fauna, claiming for higher consideration of this area in large scale conservation programs.</AbstractText>

AB  - We studied the long-term response of a cohort of eight female Agassiz’s desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) during the first 15 years following a large fire at a wind energy generation facility near Palm Springs, California, USA. The fire burned a significant portion of the study site in 1995. Tortoise activity areas were mapped using minimum convex polygons for a proximate post-fire interval from 1997 to 2000, and a long-term post-fire interval from 2009 to 2010. In addition, we measured the annual reproductive output of eggs each year and monitored the body condition of tortoises over time. One adult female tortoise was killed by the fire and five tortoises bore exposure scars that were not fatal. Despite predictions that tortoises would make the short-distance movements from burned to nearby unburned habitats, most activity areas and their centroids remained in burned areas for the duration of the study. The percentage of activity area burned did not differ significantly between the two monitoring periods. Annual reproductive output and measures of body condition remained statistically similar throughout the monitoring period. Despite changes in plant composition, conditions at this site appeared to be suitable for survival of tortoises following a major fire. High productivity at the site may have buffered tortoises from the adverse impacts of fire if they were not killed outright. Tortoise populations at less productive desert sites may not have adequate resources to sustain normal activity areas, reproductive output, and body conditions following fire.

AB  - We present here information on some fecundity parameters in local population of Eastern Hermann’s tortoise situated in the area of Kunovica, at the outskirts of the city of Nis. The data were collected in situ e.g. in the field and in 97% were based on reconstruction of number and dimensions of eggs in destroyed nests what influenced on quality of information. Only two of 78 nests recorded from 2010 to 2014 were found intact. Other 76 clutches were found destroyed and therefore only some fecundity parameters were measurable, while the others were reconstructed by using formulas proposed in the relevant literature. On the basis of collected data we estimated average clutch size of female Hermann’s tortoises in Kunovica as four eggs what was lower than in populations from Greece. However, the most of calculated egg dimensions (e.g. maximal width, volume and mass) were higher than in populations from Greece and France.

AB  - En plus des facteurs environnementaux et demographiques, les proprietes genetiques des populations sont devenues une preoccupation majeure pour preserver les populations en declin de l'extinction. Afin d’acquerir des informations pertinentes pour la planification et la mise en œuvre des strategies de conservation, les biologistes de la conservation ont realise le besoin d’avoir des connaissances en genetique des populations. Grace a l'acquisition de plus en plus rapide et de moins en moins chere d'une large gamme de marqueurs moleculaires, le recours a l’usage de l’outil moleculaire se repand de plus en plus. Ainsi, la genetique de la conservation se confirme comme une discipline a part entiere qui est donc l’utilisation de la genetique dans la preservation des especes comme entites dynamiques capables d'evoluer pour faire face aux changements environnementaux et afin de minimiser leur risque d'extinction. Par le biais de l’utilisation d’un large panel de marqueurs moleculaires (genes mitochondriaux et nucleaires, microsatellites et SNPs), nous nous sommes interesse a l’histoire evolutive a differentes echelles spatio-temporelles de la sous-espece ouest mediterraneenne Testudo. hermanni hermanni (THH), qui presente une distribution insulaire et continentale tres fragmentee. Le but de ce travail consiste a 1) comprendre les processus qui expliqueraient la distribution actuelle de la diversite genetique des populations et leur structure, 2) identifier l'origine des populations introduites (a Minorque et au Delta de l’Ebre), et 3) dater l’origine de la sous espece THH. A l’echelle des populations, il s’agit d’identifier le nombre de groupes genetiques homogenes chez la tortue d’Hermann et le degre de differentiation genetique entre ces groupes afin de definir des unites de conservation evolutivement significatives (ESU) et des unites de gestion (MU). Enfin, nous nous sommes interesses a l’etude des derniers noyaux de populations de THH dans le Var par des approches de genetique du paysage. Nos resultats ont revele qu’une divergence par vicariance est a l’ origine de l’apparition de la sous-espece T.h. hermanni. Ce scenario biogeographique s’expliquerait par les successions d’evenements glaciaires et interglaciaires qu’a connu le Pleistocene depuis plus de 2 MA provoquant un mouvement de retrait de l’espece vers des zones refuges sur la frange cotiere nord-mediterraneenne. Par ailleurs, le patron de differentiation mitochondriale Ile-continent observe et confirme par les microsatellites est tres original par rapport a ce qui est connu chez d’autres especes de reptiles partageant la meme aire de distribution. Au vue de l’analyse phylogenetique confirmee par les microsatellites, on peut affirmer que la tortue d’Hermann n’est pas native sur Minorque et qu’elle a une double origine : la premiere, resultant d’une introduction a partir d’une seule source, probablement d’une population continentale genetiquement proche des Alberes. La seconde d'origine insulaire, serait le resultat d’apports multiples, a partir de la Corse, de la Sardaigne ou de la Sicile. Enfin, l’isolement des populations de THH au sein de chaque region geographique reflete une structure genetique tres forte. Par consequent, six unites de gestion (MUs) sont proposees comme unites de conservation et de suivi sur le terrain.

AB  - A three-year study on reproduction in wild populations of Testudo hermanni has shown that:



(a) sexual activity occurs between March and October, except the nesting season (May and June), and is most frequent in August and September,



(b) tortoises are promiscuous in their mating habits, there is no evidence of mate selection in relation to size,



(c) nest site selection is correlated to ground temperature and nesting itself mainly occurs in the early evening before dark, when the ground temperature characteristics are most indicative of a specific site's relative temperature,



(d) incubation takes about three months and is probably temperature dependent,



(e) most nests are preyed upon by mammalian predators within a few days after laying (> 90% being destroyed), the main cue being the smell of the eggs,



(f) average clutch size in Greece is higher than in France, while mean egg weight in France is higher than in Greece, and there is no strong relationship between body size or weight and egg or clutch weight in either country,



(g) in contrast to other studies, there is no apparent correlation between rainfall and reproduction parameters,



(h) some females nest in successive years, and more than once in a year, with a laying interval of 10–20 days,



(i) mean size of sexually active individuals is not significantly different from the mean size of adults, although nesting females are significantly bigger; the minimum size for sexually active males is about 120 mm and for females 130 mm.



The discussion examines these observations in an evolutionary context.

AB  - Population ecology is a scientific discipline primarily interested in the ecological processes that make the number of individuals in a population to change over space and time, and by focusing on populations as fundamental units, this discipline allows studying processes at multiple scales of ecological complexity, linking basic ecological science with evolutionary studies and more applied disciplines such as conservation biology. Inference about the responses of population to change are made via observational studies that focus at either the individual or population level in order to estimate key vital rates and to determine the primary drivers of system dynamics. However, a problem of observational studies is that quite often the ecological and observational processes are confounded, leading to biased estimates and wrong conclusions about a population, so more specific and robust analytical approaches need to be applied for a correct scientific study of the populations. In this thesis, I have consistently applied a methodological approach that allows the study of population processes by separating ecological and observational processes via the estimation and modelling of key demographic parameters. By means of chapters 1 to 4, I provide several examples of this methodology via the analysis of demographic data belonging to different species and levels of population complexity that also reflect different biological questions and scientific applications. Field data for this thesis was collected using either capture-recapture or detection-non detection sampling techniques and were provided via collaborations with different researchers and institutions. Chapters 1 and 2 focus on discrete mediterranean tortoise (Testudo hermanni) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) populations, respectively. These populations are closed to dispersal processes and in both chapters I focused on stage-dependent local survival rates that were estimated using capture-recapture models that take into account recapture probabilities. Given that individuals were classified according to body size, in the case of the brown trout populations, I could apply multistate capture-recapture models to estimate individual growth and maturation rates across different populations. In both chapters, survival dynamics were modelled using external covariates (temperature and/or precipitation) that explained part of the observed variation in survival. In the case of tortoises, the obtained survival-precipitation relationship was used to perform several population viability analyses under future precipitation scenarios to forecast the extinction risk of the species across their global geographic distribution. Chapters 3 and 4 focus on population networks connected by dispersal processes. Chapter 3 is strictly focused on adult dispersal and so analyses a capture-recapture dataset collected over 4 local populations of Audouin’s gull (Larus audouinii) in the Western Mediterranean. In Chapter 4 I analysed a large database on butterfly species collected at 26 sites in Catalonia over 17 years and focused on species’ extinction-colonization dynamics at a large geographical scale. In both chapters, two relatively recent analytical approaches, the multievent modelling (chapter 3) and the multiseason or dynamic occupancy modelling (chapter 4) were applied. The application of such modelling tools allowed, in the case of gulls, to control recapture heterogeneities and to study individual dispersal both in and out of the study area, by means of the addition of unobservable states in the model. In the case of butterflies, a common candidate model set was applied to 73 butterfly species, obtaining specific extinction and colonization rates corrected for species’ detectability, which allowed assessing the influence of the species’ traits on occupancy dynamics. Covariate modelling became much more complex in these chapters, but allowed the identification of different habitat and environmental variables related to dispersal, extinction and colonization processes that are of high value in the conservation and management of the species under study.

AB  - Adult annual survival rates estimated by mark–recapture for eight Greek populations of the tortoise Testudo hermanni were in the range 0.80–1.0 (mean 0.886). Estimates from growth rings for the same populations were in a similar range (0.84–0.95, mean 0.899). The average survival rate from the two methods was significantly positively related to mean adult body size (r=0.815) and negatively related to effective temperature (r=−0.880). A life table model was used to investigate the consequences of adult survival rate for optimum age at maturity and mean adult size of females. The basis of the model was the trade-off between increased reproduction from large adult size, and decreased survival to maturity from delayed age at maturity. The model showed that the observed variation in adult survival rates was more than sufficient to account for the variation of adult size among populations. The model thus predicted an even greater range of mean adult size than that observed. A negative correlation between growth rate and adult survival rate or age at maturity, as observed, was needed to fit the size data. The model supports the hypothesis that variation in adult size of T. hermanni in Greece is adaptive (rather than a non-adaptive environmental or phylogenetic effect) and due to variation in adult survival rates (rather than other factors such as juvenile survival).

AB  - <jats:p>Decline of a Hermann’s Tortoise (Testudo hermanni hermanni Gmelin, 1789) population in forest. Combined effects of several anthropogenic factors. </jats:p>
     <jats:p>This study investigates the evolution of a population of Hermann’s tortoises, located on the edge of the massif des Maures, over a period of 30 years through capture– recapture monitoring. It shows a considerable decline of 73 % in the number of adult tortoises between the early 1980s and 1999 ; then from 1999, the population stabilized at around 100 adult tortoises. The fall in numbers during the first period seems to be linked to several factors. The 22 % increase in forest cover between 1983 and 1995 increased the concentrations of eggs laid in some open areas, making it easier for the species’ natural predators to find them. Mechanized clearance of undergrowth carried out in 1989 and 1994 has undoubtedly reduced the size of the population. The presence of dogs has posed an additional threat (97 % of the adult tortoises have bite marks and 7 % are missing limbs). In addition, the impact of dog bites on the tortoises’ shells has, over time, removed individual markings, thereby distorting survival estimates. The stabilization of numbers over the last decade seems to be due to the discontinuation of certain practices (notably mechanized undergrowth clearance). However, the demographic structure (with almost no juveniles) could soon lead to another decrease in population. This situation seems to be specific to this particular population and cannot be applied generally to all the populations in Provence.</jats:p>

AB  - L'introduction de tortues en milieu naturel, accidentelle ou intentionnelle (programmes de conservation), peut entrainer des risques sanitaires pour les populations locales. Des controles parasitologiques ont ete realises sur des Testudo hermanni du Village des Tortues issues de captivite et apportees par des particuliers. Les resultats sont compares a ceux qui sont obtenus sur des Testudo hermanni sauvages du Centre Var. Au Village des Tortues, les animaux sont systematiquement vermifuges a leur arrivee afin d'eviter toute contamination des tortues du parc par des parasites potentiellement pathogenes. La vermifugation n'est jamais efficace a 100%. Il reste souvent des oeufs ou des vers qui peuvent etre transmissibles. L'objectif est de verifier la nature des especes de parasites qui restent apres vermifugation, afin d'etablir s'ils presentent un danger pour les populations sauvages en cas de contacts. Des examens coprologiques et post-mortem montrent la presence de nematodes appartenant aux familles des Pharyngodonidae (Oxyuroidea) et des Atractidae (Cosmocercoidea) aussi bien chez les tortues du Village des Tortues que chez les tortues sauvages. Apres traitement, les tortues captives ne presentent donc pas de risques de contamination des sauvages par des helminthes parasites dangereux. Ce travail inclut la premiere observation de Tachygonetria numidica chez une Testudo hermanni sauvage.

AB  - Over a period of two years we used radiology to investigate breeding traits in females of two western populations of the threatened Hermann's tortoise Testudo hermanni hermanni. The main purpose of the study was to see if reproductive traits - clutch size, clutch frequency, annual egg production and egg width - varied between populations in Corsica (France) and the Ebro Delta (Spain), and if these traits were affected by female body size and amounts of spring rainfall. All the breeding traits analysed were greater in the Corsican population than in the Ebro Delta population. These differences were also significant when we used female body size as a covariable. In both populations the amount of spring rainfall affected breeding traits but not clutch size. Nevertheless, only in the Corsican population did clutch frequency, annual egg production and egg width increase significantly in the year with a wet spring. Contrary to the predictions of Optimal Propagule Size theory, we found that egg size and clutch size increased with female size, and that both variables were independent. On the other hand, clutch frequency was not related to female body size. Thus, in the Hermann's tortoise, as clutch size did not change between years and clutch frequency was independent of female size, all females are able to increase their reproductive output in years with favourable conditions by increasing their clutch frequency. Nevertheless, other factors besides female size and rainfall may influence in a highly complex way variability in breeding traits among populations.

AB  - We studied reproductive characters of a population of the tortoise Testudo h. hermanni in the Plaine des Maures (Var), and compared these to another population in southern France and to T. h. boettgeri in Greece. Clutch characters, which are measures of total reproductive investment, showed no differences between subspecies or sites after body size correction by ANCOVA. Egg characters, which measure the division of this investment among offspring, did vary significantly among both subspecies and sites after correcting for body mass. The presence of such local variation should discourage relocation of the threatened T. h. hermanni even between populations of the same subspecies.

AB  - Paper description: The Hermann’s tortoise and its habitats are among conservation priorities in the European Union. Populations of western subspecies are closely monitored and basic information about eastern subspecies is just starting to emerge. We used precise observation data to model the distribution of Hermann’s tortoise in Serbia and its ecological niche. Both modeled and observed distributions suggest that most suitable habitats are situated in lowland areas of eastern, central and southern Serbia, under semi-open habitats ranging from pastures and shrubs to broad leaf forests. Our results provide crucial information which should be considered when shaping NATURA 2000 sites in Serbia. Abstract: Hermann’s tortoise ( Testudo hermanni ) is among the conservation priorities in the European Union. Consequently, it is included in Annexes II and IV of the EU Habitats Directive, Annex II of the Bern Convention, and Annex II of the CITES Convention. Hermann’s tortoise conservation programs compile insights on the threats affecting population viability, along with factors shaping the species’ distribution. Serbian populations of the eastern subspecies ( Testudo hermanni boettgeri ) seem numerous and therefore prosperous, but recent population viability analyses revealed that they are susceptible to rapid demographic changes and/or habitat destruction. This implies the need for effective population monitoring and protection, as well as mapping and conservation of suitable habitats. In this paper we summarized current knowledge about the geographic distribution of Hermann’s tortoise in Serbia and modeled its ecological niche. Our results corroborate and uphold the known species’ distribution in Serbia. Most suitable habitats are situated in the lowland areas of eastern, central and southern Serbia, under semi-open habitats, such as pastures and shrubs, broadleaf forests, and all successional stages in between. The results provided in this paper should be considered in the selection and shaping of NATURA 2000 sites in Serbia. https://doi.org/10.2298/ABS190406034G Received: April 6, 2019; Revised: May 1, 2019; Accepted: May 7, 2019; Published online: June 5, 2019 How to cite this article: Golubovic A, Tomovic Lj, Nikolic M, Nikolic S, Anđelkovic M, Arsovski D, Ikovic V, Gvozdenovic S, Popovic M.

AB  - Photosynthetic tissues, the major food source of many invertebrates and vertebrates, are well defended. Many defence traits in leaves are controlled via the jasmonate signalling pathway in which jasmonate acts as a hormone by binding to a receptor to activate responses that lead to increased resistance to invertebrate folivores. We predicted that mutations in jasmonate synthesis might also increase the vulnerability of leaves to vertebrate folivores and tested this hypothesis using the Eastern Hermann's tortoise (Eurotestudo boettgeri) and an Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae) allene oxide synthase (aos) mutant unable to synthesize jasmonate. Tortoises preferred the aos mutant over the wild type (WT). Based on these results, we then investigated the effect of mutating jasmonate perception using a segregating population of the recessive A. thaliana jasmonate receptor mutant coronatine insensitive1-1 (coi1-1). Genotyping of these plants after tortoise feeding revealed that the homozygous coi1-1 receptor mutant was consumed more readily than the heterozygous mutant or the WT. Therefore, the plant's ability to synthesize or perceive jasmonate reduces feeding by a vertebrate herbivore. We also tested whether or not tortoise feeding behaviour was influenced by glucosinolates, the principal defence chemicals in Arabidopsis leaves with known roles in defence against many generalist insects. However, in contrast to what has been observed with such insects, leaves in which the levels of these compounds were reduced genetically were consumed at a similar rate to those of the WT.

AB  - Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) is widely distributed in western and southern Europe. Most populations in the western part of the distribution range (e.g. Spain, France, Italy) are severely reduced, and relatively well studied, whilst the species is still abundant in eastern areas (i.e. the Balkans). However, essential biological information (e.g. main morphological, ecological, and behavioural characteristics) for the Balkans are still extremely limited. As reptiles exhibit strong geographic variation in most morphological, as well as life history traits, gathering data from distant areas is important. We present data from two populations of T. hermanni in Serbia, focusing on sexual dimorphism in body size and body shape. We found that almost all of the 43 morphological traits analysed were significantly different between sexes and that sexual size and sexual shape dimorphisms were not expressed in similar ways. Notably, sexual size dimorphism (SSD) was more pronounced than sexual shape dimorphism (SShD). Our analyses suggested that SShD is more stable than SSD, and that the scale of the focus (i.e. whole body proportions versus morphological details) is a key factor to test this notion. When general measurements were considered, the expected consistency of SShD between populations was verified; nevertheless, when more specific morphological attributes were considered, substantial variations were observed. These results provide a baseline for comparisons between populations to further examine geographic variation of sexual dimorphism.

AB  - Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni), the best-known western Palaearctic tortoise species, has a rare natural distribution pattern comprising the Mediterranean areas of the Iberian, Apennine, and Balkan Peninsulas, as well as Sicily, Corsica and Sardinia. The western part of this range is traditionally considered habitat for T. h. hermanni, while T. h. boettgeri occurs in the Balkans. Taxonomy of this tortoise has been challenged in recent years, with the two subspecies being considered full species and the central Dalmatian populations of T. h. boettgeri being considered a third species, T. hercegovinensis. Using an mtDNA fragment approximately 1150 bp long (cytochrome b gene and adjacent portion of tRNA-Thr gene), we investigated mtDNA diversity with regard to contrasting concepts of two subspecies or three species. Seven closely related haplotypes were identified from the western Mediterranean and 15 different, in part much-differentiated, haplotypes from the Balkans. Western Mediterranean haplotypes differ from Balkan haplotypes in 16–42 mutation steps. One to seven mutation steps occur within western Mediterranean populations. Balkan haplotypes, differing in 1−37 nucleotides, group in parsimony network analysis into three major assemblages that display, in part, a similar degree of differentiation to that of western Mediterranean haplotypes relative to Balkan haplotypes. Rates of sequence evolution are different in both regions, and low divergence, palaeogeography and the fossil record suggest a slower molecular clock in the western Mediterranean. While monophyly in western Mediterranean haplotypes is well-supported, conflicting evidence is obtained for Balkan haplotypes; maximum parsimony supports monophyly of Balkan haplotypes, but other phylogenetic analyses (Bayesian, ML, ME) indicate Balkan haplotypes could be paraphyletic with respect to the western Mediterranean clade. These results imply a process of differentiation not yet complete despite allopatry in the western Mediterranean and the Balkans, and suggest all populations of T. hermanni are conspecific. In the western Mediterranean no clear geographical pattern in haplotype distribution is found. Distribution of Balkan haplotypes is more structured. One group of similar haplotypes occurs in the eastern Balkans (Bulgaria, Republic of Macedonia, Romania and the Greek regions Evvia, Macedonia, Peloponnese, Thessaly and Thrace). Two distinct haplotypes, differing in eight to nine mutation steps from the most common haplotype of the first group, are confined to the western slope of the Taygetos Mts. in the Peloponnese. Yet another group, connected over between four and 23 mutation steps with haplotypes of the eastern Balkan group, occurs along the western slope of the Dinarid and Pindos Mts. (Istria, Dalmatia, western Greece). Taygetos haplotypes are nested within other haplotypes in all phylogenetic analyses and support for monophyly of the other Balkan groups is at best weak. We conclude that using the traditional two subspecies model should be continued for T. hermanni. Phylogeographies of T. hermanni and Emys orbicularis, another codistributed chelonian, are markedly different, but share a few similarities. Both were forced to retreat to southern refuges during Pleistocene glaciations. With the advent of Holocene warming, E. orbicularis underwent rapid range expansion and temperate regions of Europe and adjacent Asia were recolonized from refuges in the Balkans and the northern Black Sea Region. By contrast, T. hermanni remained more or less confined to refuges and nearby regions, resulting in a much smaller range, and allopatric and parapatric distribution of haplotype groups and clades. MtDNA lineages are more diverse in E. orbicularis than they are in T. hermanni on southern European peninsulas, indicating several distinct glacial refuges in close proximity and extensive intergradation during Holocene range expansion for E. orbicularis. In T. hermanni it is likely that only on the Balkan Peninsula was more than one refuge located, corresponding to the parapatric ranges of haplotype groups currently there. On the old western Mediterranean islands Corsica and Sardinia no differentiated (E. orbicularis) or only weakly differentiated haplotypes (T. hermanni) occur, even though there is evidence for the presence of both species on Corsica since at least the Middle Pleistocene. High mountain chains constitute major barriers separating distinct mtDNA clades or groups in each species.

AB  - <jats:p>Hermann’s tortoise (<jats:italic>Testudo hermanni</jats:italic>) is listed as “Near threatened” in the IUCN Red list of endangered species. The importance of protecting the Hermann’s tortoise populations and its habitats have led to the inclusion of the species within CITES Convention (Annex II), Annex A of EU Wildlife Trade Regulation, Annex II of the Bern Convention and Annexes II and IV of the EU Habitats Directive. To assess the distribution and status of the eastern Hermann’s tortoise (<jats:italic>Testudo hermanni boettgeri</jats:italic>) in Croatia, historical and recent records were gathered and analyzed. The species was recorded in all three biogeographical regions in the country, but it’s native to the Mediterranean and a small part of the Alpine region. With the increase of recent surveys and the use of citizen science platforms, the known range of the species in Croatia was increased by 35.8% and is now encompassing 123 10 × 10 km EEA reference grid cells. Most records (66%) originate from lower elevations (up to 199 m), and the highest was recorded at 570 m. Sparse forests are the most preferred habitats, followed by semi-open habitats, such as grasslands and shrubs. The most serious threat to the species is natural succession due to the increased abandonment of traditional farming and grazing. Other threats include touristic infrastructure and urban development, transportation, illegal collecting, and invasive species. The Area of Occupancy calculated using 2 × 2 km grids resulted in an AOO of 1,372.00 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, while Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is calculated to be 18,145.07 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. The current network of National protected areas includes 14% of the species’ AOO while the designated Natura 2000 areas include 29.30% of its AOO. We propose to designate an additional 10 Natura 2000 areas to help with the long-term protection of the species.</jats:p>

AB  - For the first time, inguinal palpation effectively detected calcified oviductal eggs in a tortoise species. Inguinal palpations for 36 Hermann's tortoises, from six samples during spring 1999 and spring 2000, were verified with X-ray radiography. Palpation results did not differ significantly from radiography results and did not differ between two independent observers. A logistic regression analysis indicated that palpation success depended on the presence of oviductal eggs, and not on observer, year (1999 or 2000) or tortoise age class (young adult or old adult). The probability of correctly classifying females as gravid or nongravid through palpation was 78.4%. Although inguinal palpation did not allow detection of all clutches, it is a simple, inexpensive and effective means to determine the breeding status of Hermann's tortoise populations.

AB  - We used radiography over two breeding seasons to investigate female reproductive phenology in a Corsican population of Hermann’s tortoise. Wild females were kept in semi-captivity in similar conditions to the wild. The main purpose of the study was to determine the length of the breeding season for each female, the laying period, and the approximate length of the inter-clutch interval and clutch retention time. Clutches were laid only in May and June, and in both years the monthly proportions were similar. In 1998 the length of the breeding season (mean±SE = 44.7±3.3 days) was greater than in 1999 (33.1±2.6 days), but we found no annual differences in the date of first and second clutches. There were no differences in the inter-clutch interval between individual females or between years. Clutch retention time varied among clutches of the same year, but not between years for the same clutch order. When considering the order in which the clutches were laid, we observed that the first clutches were concentrated in May, whereas the second and third clutches were concentrated in June. In both years, only the females that laid their first clutches in May were able to lay a second or even a third clutch in June. Bigger females tended to lay first clutches earlier in the breeding season than did the smaller ones. The differences observed in the length of the breeding season between years may be explained by the annual differences in the frequency of females that produced one, two or three clutches, since we found no annual differences in the date of first and second clutches, in the inter-clutch interval or in the clutch retention time (for the same order of clutches).

AB  - We studied the thermal ecology of Testudo hermanni hermanni in Menorca during late spring. We measured body temperatures of adult individuals, together with air and substrate temperatures at points of capture. Sunlight exposure (full sun, filtered sun, or shade) and type of substrate were also recorded. Body temperatures were similar between sexes (mean = 29.95°C) as were air temperatures between gender capture sites (mean = 28.33°C). Conversely, females were found in areas with a higher substrate temperature (31.60°C) than males were (29.15°C). Moreover, the correlation between body and air temperatures was stronger than it was between body and substrate temperatures, as found in other populations of this species. The tortoises were usually found in full sun, and the proportion of animals found in each sunlight category was similar between sexes. Our results contribute to the knowledge of the thermal ecology of the western Hermann’s tortoise.

AB  - In France, wild tortoises occur at low densities (  10/ha). The population structure is heavily skewed in favour of old adults and recruitment is low. The population is declining due to habitat loss, both from fire and through the decline in traditional horticultural practices, leading to a reduction in nest site availability. The increase in nest density in the few suitable sites remaining leaves the eggs highly vulnerable to predation and losses of over 90% cannot be sustained. The active season is from March to November, but there is evidence of some activity during the hibernation period. Adult males maintain small, fixed home ranges, while females undertake distinct migrations to and from nesting sites in the spring and can switch to new home ranges. Juveniles are sedentary up to the age of 4 or 5 years, a...

AB  - In this paper, we present a review of distributional data for reptiles in Slovenia collected prior to April 2009. Data are presented in a 10x10 km UTM grid and divided into two classes by the ageC 1995 or earlier, and 1996-2009. With this review, we would like to create a basis for future field work and emphasize the distributional gaps. For some species, the knowledge of their distribution has increased substantially in the last 13 years (e.g. for Podarcis muralis, Vipera aspis, Zamenis longissimus, Anguis fragilis, Natrix natrix, N. tessellata, and Lacerta viridis ž bilineata). The increase in some introduced species (e.g. Trachemys scripta and Testudo hermanni) is probably aconsequence of additional introductions by people. On average, the number of UTM squares with recorded presence of autochthonous species has increased by 12% per species after 1995. For some of the species, no more records have beenmade after 1995 in many areas where they had been recorded before (e.g. Podarcis melisellensis, Vipera ammodytes, V. berus, Emys orbicularis, and Lacerta agilis), which might indicate the possibility of local extinctions. For the future, we recommend a continual monitoring of the population trends concerning individual species.

AB  - We used 454-sequencing to identify and characterize 32 microsatellite loci for the Western Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni hermanni) for which primer sequences, characteristics, and multiplexes are provided. These markers have been tested for one continental (Var) and one insular (Corsica) French population as well as for the Eastern Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni boettgeri). For these 3 populations, 24 loci were polymorphic. These microsatellite markers will be particularly useful to assess the genetic diversity and characteristics of the different Hermann's tortoise populations and will have direct applications for its protection, notably with respect to reintroduction and conservation programs.

AB  - Concurrent surveys of the mortality of tortoises, after purchase from pet shops, were undertaken during the periods May 1982 to May 1986 and May 1983 to May 1986. The first survey involved 499 Testudo graeca ibera and the second 106 Testudo hermanni hermanni. By the end of the survey periods 91·8% of the T. graeca were dead and 86·8% of the T. hermanni. A yearly mortality rate of between 23% and 29% is much greater than would be expected in a stable wild population. Problems associated with hibernation accounted for 84·5% of deaths. On the basis of this survey the mass importation of tortoises, into the United Kingdom, cannot be justified.

AB  - Abstract A 12SrRNA mitochondrial fragment was sequenced in 47 Testudo hermanni individuals from three different populations in northeastern Italy, Sicily, and Spain. All these locations fall within the distribution range usually recognized for the T. h. hermanni subspecies. Seven different sequences were identified, which clearly separate the highly variable northern Italian group from the homogenous individuals in Sicily and Spain. More interestingly, almost all the northern individuals had a DNA sequence identical or very similar to three sequences belonging to individuals from the Balkans and Greece, and morphologically classified as T. h. boettgeri.

L’area total mostrejada va ser de 95,7 ha. Durant aquest seguiment tambe s’ha recollit informacio dels parametres demografics de sex-ratio i de classes d’edat, aixi com de biometria de les tortugues. En total s’han localitzat 174 tortugues en les parceŀles de cens i s’ha estimat que la densitat del conjunt de tortugues (classes d’edat i de sexe combinades) variava entre les 0,7 i les 11,5 tortugues/ ha. La sex-ratio va estar esbiaixada cap a les femelles (1,0M:1,6F) i la classe d’edat dels adults va representar el 85,6 % de la poblacio. Les tortugues adultes van presentar un marcat dimorfisme sexual en les mides, essent les femelles mes grans que els mascles (16 % mes grans en la longitud recta de la closca i 39 % en el pes). L’avaluacio d’aquests parametres demografics ha permes identificar que hi ha zones de l’Albera on es mantenen nuclis poblacionals amb bones densitats, que poden servir com a zones de refugi i d’expansio de l’especie. La repeticio d’aquests censos al llarg dels anys ha de ser una valuosa eina per determinar l’evolucio d’aquestes poblacions EnglishDuring 2019, the population of the Hermann’s tortoise in the Albera Mountains (Girona, Catalonia) has been censed using the capturemark-recapture method. The total sampled area was 95.7 ha. Furthermore, demographic parameters such as sex-ratio and age class data of the tortoises as well as biometric measurements have been collected. In total, 174 tortoises have been found throughout the sampled parcels and the tortoise density estimation (combining age and sex classes) has varied between 0.7 and 11.5 tortoises/ha. The sex-ratio has shown a bias to the females (1.0M:1.6F) and the adult age class represented the 85.6 % of the population. The adult tortoises show a high sexual dimorphism according to size, being females bigger than males (16 % larger -in straight carapace length- and 39 % heavier). The evaluation of demographic parameters has allowed the identification of some zones with a good population density. These zones could be safe areas and be used as an expansion nucleus for the species. Repeating the census over the coming years could become an appreciated tool to determine the evolution of Albera’s population

AB  - The aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of forestry works on Testudo hermanni hermanni, and to establish ecological parameters useful for habitat management. This study took place in the northeast of Spain, in the Albera Mountains, where one of the last natural populations of Hermann’s tortoises lives. Twenty-one tortoises were weekly monitored using radiotracking during six months, between July 2009 and January 2010. Between October 2009 and January 2010, forestry works took place at the study site. The impact of the forestry works and the associated damages were estimated using two approaches: the displacements of the monitored tortoises and the use of plaster models resembling tortoises, which were placed in similar locations and conditions to live tortoises. Radiotracking results showed that 30% of the tortoises were found on open areas (pastures and sparse cork oak forest), whereas 70% corresponded to dense forests and heath scrubland locations. The analysis of the effect of forestry works showed that tortoises were affected by the works in 45% of the cases, even during hibernation period. The simulation results of the impact of the forestry works based on plaster models showed that 4% of the models were seriously damaged when using manual works (brush cutters and clearing saws), whereas mechanized works (chain tractor) were responsible for an estimation of 22% mortality and 6% serious damages.

AB  - Extensive radiotracking of adult Testudo hermanni for 1 year, and regular inspections for 5 years, in a coastal area of central Italy, allowed us to assess the seasonal variation in mobility and home range size of both sexes, and their use of the different parts of home range. Males are more mobile than the females but, due to a different long-term movement pattern, they have a generally smaller home range. Both sexes show a marked seasonal variation in home range size, but no seasonal migrations. Wild rabbits burrows, and simple pallets under dense vegetation are repeatedly used as shelters by the same individual. The animals show a certain preference for specific basking areas in the midst of dense shrubbery. They feed mainly on vegetation common throughout the study area but special displacements in order to forage also occur. Mating encounters are based on home range overlapping between mates and high male mobility. Our findings and those of other authors on different populations of the same species s...

AB  - Two types of pathogens cause highly contagious upper respiratory tract diseases (URTD) in Chelonians: testudinid herpesviruses (TeHV) and a mycoplasma (Mycoplasma agassizii). In captivity, these infections are frequent and can provoke outbreaks. Pet trade generates an international flow of tortoises, often without sanitary checking; individuals intentionally or accidentally released in the wild may spread pathogens. A better understanding of the transmission of infectious agents from captivity to wild tortoises is needed. Many exotic individuals have been introduced in populations of the endangered western Hermanns tortoise (Testudo hermanni hermanni), notably spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca). We assessed the presence of TeHV and mycoplasma in native western Hermanns tortoises and in potential pet vectors in south-eastern France. Using a large sample (N=572 tortoises), this study revealed, by PCR, the worrying presence of herpesvirus in 7 free-ranging individuals (3 sub-populations). Additionally, Mycoplasma agassizii was detected, by PCR, in 15 of the 18 populations sampled with a frequency ranging from 3.4% (1 of 29 tortoises) to 25% (3 of 12 tortoises). Exotic spur-thighed tortoises showed a high frequency of mycoplasma infection in captivity (18.2%) and in individuals (50%) found in native Hermanns tortoise sub-populations, suggesting that this species could be a significant vector. The paucity of information of TeHV on European tortoise URTD in natural settings, especially in combination with mycoplasma, prompts further studies. Indeed, sick tortoises remain concealed and may not be easily detected in the field. Our results indicate good health for most infected tortoises but they should be screened in the field as well as in captivity.

AB  - Species abundance and habitat distribution are two important aspects of species conservation studies and both are affected by similar environmental factors. Forest resource inventory data in 2010 were used to evaluate the patterns of habitat for target species of Cervidae in six typical forestry bureaus of the Yichun forest area in the Lesser Xing’an Mountains, northeastern China. A habitat suitability index (HSI) model was used based on elevation, slope, aspect, vegetation and age of tree. These five environmental factors were selected by boosted regression tree (BRT) analysis from 14 environmental variables collected during field surveys. Changes in habitat caused by anthropogenic activities mainly involving settlement and road factors were also considered. The results identified 1780.49 km2 of most-suitable and 1770.70 km2 of unsuitable habitat areas under natural conditions, covering 16.38% and 16.29% of the entire study area, respectively. The area of most-suitable habitat had been reduced by 4.86% when human interference was taken into account, whereas the unsuitable habitat area had increased by 11.3%, indicating that anthropogenic disturbance turned some potential habitats into unsuitable ones. Landscape metrics indicated that average patch area declined while patch density and edge density increased. This suggests that as habitat becomes fragmented and its quality becomes degraded by human activities, cervid populations will be threatened with extirpation. The study helped identify the spatial extent of habitat influenced by anthropogenic interference for the local cervid population. As cervid species clearly avoid human activities, more attention should be paid on considering the way and intensity of human activities for habitat management as fully as possible

AB  - The evolution of sexual dimorphism (SD) is driven by intricate interplays between sexual and natural selection. When it comes to SD variation within populations, however, environmental factors play a major role. Sexually selected traits are expected to be strongly dependent on individual body condition, which is influenced by the local environment that individuals experience. As a consequence, the degree of SD may also depend on resource availability. Here, we investigated the potential drivers of SD expression at two sexually dimorphic morphometric traits, body size (snout vent length) and head shape (head geometric morphometrics), in the Italian wall lizard (Podarcis siculus). We assessed the existence of condition- and context-dependent SD across ten islands of the Aeolian archipelago (southern Italy), at within- and among-population scales. We observed strong geographical variation of SD among islands, and tested three potential SD predictors related to resource availability (individual body condition, ecosystem productivity, temperature). Body condition and ecosystem productivity were the main drivers of body size SD variation, and body condition was also the main driver for head shape SD. Our results highlight that the expression of SD in the Italian wall lizard is both condition- and context-dependent. These results are congruent at within- and among-populations scales highlighting that spatial multi-scale analysis represents a useful approach to understand patterns of SD expression.

AB  - In terrestrial animals with rigid protective structures, the ability to upright after being overturned can make the difference between life and death, especially in suboptimal thermal conditions or in the presence of predators. This trait is assumed to be under strong selection. Different factors can influence righting ability, body dimensions and body mass for instance. As these morphological traits diverge among populations, inter-population variability in righting ability is expected. Previous studies on tortoises were performed within single populations and they usually focused on juveniles raised in captivity, precluding an assessment of the inter-population variability in a natural (realistic) context. In the current study, we quantified the righting performance in four populations of free-ranging adult tortoises. We found strong differences in righting success among populations and between genders, suggesting possible adaptations to local conditions. For instance, the topography (e.g. slopes) of each study site varied markedly. On average, males were more successful in righting themselves than females. Body size did not influence righting performances in males, but larger females were less successful compared to smaller ones. The success in righting was positively correlated with carapace domedness (height) and short bridges.

AB  - A chelonid herpesvirus was isolated from a group of tortoises in Italy with a history of increased mortality and upper digestive and respiratory tract disease. The isolated virus was inactivated with formalin and used to prepare a nonadjuvanted vaccine and a vaccine adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide. 57 tortoises, 26 Testudo hermanni, 25 T. graeca, and 6 T. marginata, were included in the study. The animals were vaccinated 3 times at 45 day intervals. Blood was collected from the animals 14 days prior to the first vaccination, and on day 0, 25, 45, 90, 113 and 369 after the first vaccination. Plasma antibody titers to the homologous chelonid herpesvirus were determined using a virus neutralization test (VNT). No significant rise in antibody titer was noted in the vaccinated animals. Antibody titers measured dropped below the cutoff-level sporadically in all positive animals. Repeat serological testing may therefore be necessary in order to detect seropositive animals.

AB  - Eastern Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni boettgeri) is a subspecies of Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) found in Albania. Gender determination is one of the crucial elements in determining the population dynamics in all species. Female and male adult tortoises look different, but these differences can be difficult to distinguish in captivity or when their sex indicators are deformed or injured. Therefore, the aim of this study was to use indirect and non-invasive methods such as geometric morphometric analysis to determine the sex of adult tortoises. For the geometric morphometry, 17 female and 23 male Hermann's tortoises were collected and photographed from the hills and mountains around the Tirana district of Albania between August and October 2019. Sexes were discriminated based on geometric morphometry, and plastron shape was a better indicator than carapace shape. In addition, abdominal, femoral and anal scutes on the plastron and the ratio of femoral to pectoral suture lengths were important for the sex distinction. Females had a larger plastron than males; this may have been supported by fecundity selection, because a large plastron suggests more volume in which to store eggs. The femoral and anal scutes were larger in male tortoises, and serve as a stronger base during mating. This study was conducted for adults only, and future studies are needed to determine if these indicators also apply to hatchlings and juveniles.

AB  - Abstract Body condition indices (BCI – mass scaled by size) are widely used in ecological studies. They presumably reflect variations of endogenous fat reserves in free-ranging animals. In the field, however, accurately quantifying internal body reserves is a difficult task. This is especially true in armoured animals where convenient clues that may guide BCI assessment (e.g. visible subcutaneous fat deposits) remain inaccessible. Alternatively, inclusive dissections may provide anatomical abacuses to estimate body reserves in living individuals. Sacrificing animals for this purpose is not acceptable. We opportunistically tested the ability of BCI to estimate body reserves in 13 free-ranging Hermann's tortoises (Gmelin, 1789) dissected soon after they died from natural causes. On average, BCI values were lower in dissected tortoises relative to living individuals (N > 10,000 measurements), but they remained within the range of variation of the studied populations. Shell mass relative to body mass was high and showed considerable inter-individual variation (33.5% to 52.3%). Stomach and digestive tract content represented another important and variable part of total body mass (4.4% to 14.5%). The contribution of fat bodies was negligible (0.0% to 0.5%). Overall, in the studied tortoises, variations of body condition are weakly determined by variations of fat stores. Other endogenous (e.g. muscles, visceral tissues, liver) and “exogenous” (e.g. digestive tract content, clutch) elements should be considered to better understand age and sex specific life-history trade-offs faced by chelonians.

AB  - Crocodilepox virus is a large dsDNA virus belonging to the genus Crocodylidpoxvirus, which infects a wide range of host species in the order Crocodylia worldwide. Here, we present genome sequences for a novel saltwater crocodilepox virus, with two subtypes (SwCRV-1 and -2), isolated from the Australian saltwater crocodile. Affected belly skins of juvenile saltwater crocodiles were used to sequence complete viral genomes, and perform electron microscopic analysis that visualized immature and mature virions. Analysis of the SwCRV genomes showed a high degree of sequence similarity to CRV (84.53% and 83.70%, respectively), with the novel SwCRV-1 and -2 complete genome sequences missing 5 and 6 genes respectively when compared to CRV, but containing 45 and 44 predicted unique genes. Similar to CRV, SwCRV also lacks the genes involved in virulence and host range, however, considering the presence of numerous hypothetical and or unique genes in the SwCRV genomes, it is completely reasonable that the genes encoding these functions are present but not recognized. Phylogenetic analysis suggested a monophyletic relationship between SwCRV and CRV, however, SwCRV is quite distinct from other chordopoxvirus genomes. These are the first SwCRV complete genome sequences isolated from saltwater crocodile skin lesions.

AB  - Many animals under human care are kept indoors to prevent infectious diseases vectored by wildlife, facilitate environment control, or due to the lifestyle of their owners. However, ultraviolet radiation has documented effects on animal vision, vitamin synthesis, immunity, behavior, psychogenic disorders and on their environment. Ultraviolet-emitting lights are commercially available and the documentation of their effect on indoor-housed animals is increasing. This article reviews published information about ultraviolet effects in vertebrate animals from veterinary and ethological perspectives, and techniques used to assess ultraviolet exposure across animal taxa.

AB  - We review in detail the published fossil record of turtles from Sardinia and, in addition, we document previously undescribed specimens for the first time. Among these undescribed specimens, is the oldest occurrence of Testudo hermanni on the island, from the Early Pleistocene of Monte Tuttavista. The turtle fossil record in Sardinia goes back to the Eocene and comprises 18 different taxa, pertaining to 6 lineages: Podocnemididae, Cheloniidae, Emydidae, Geoemydidae, Testudinidae, and Trionychidae. Remarkable is the occurrence of Eocene pleurodires, whose presence is in agreement with the Oligo-Miocene rifting of the Corso-Sardinian block. Interestingly, the fossil record provides evidence for the presence in the island of both Testudo hermanni and Emys orbicularis during the Pleistocene although according to molecular data the extant populations of these two taxa were introduced in recent times. Finally, a large ungual phalanx from the Middle–Late Pleistocene Monte San Giovanni bone breccia testifies the occurrence of a giant tortoise in the Quaternary terrestrial ecosystem of Sardinia.

AB  - During the five consecutive years (2010-2014), in the local population of the eastern Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni boettgeri) in the vicinity of Kunovica village near Nis, the variation of selected life-history parameters, population structure and some additional characteristics reflecting the population status were observed and measured. The existence of sexual size and shape dimorphism has been confirmed, followed by a slight variation in the body mass condition index of adult tortoises during consecutive years of monitoring, which could indicate a stable health status of the population. Adult sex ratio deviates from the otimum, so that the females were more numerous than males. Determining the prеcise age structure was not possible. Also, a wide range of variation in the age of achieving sexual maturity has been observed. The average clutch size fits into the range of values reported in the literature. The average survival rate of adult individuals was high and no differences in survival between sexes were found, also differences between sexes in the size of the area of movement were not determined. An analysis of the viability of the hypothetically isolated Hermann's tortoise population in Kunovica, within the experimental area, showed that such a population is not viable. Accordingly, the minimum viable size of this population has not been determined, but it has been established that an increase in the carrying capacity of the habitat leads to a significant reduction of the extinction. Among the simulated parameters, the most critical one for long-term survival is the very disturbed sex ratio at birth. In contrast, the earlier sexual maturation and the younger age of the first reproduction, could approach the status of a viable for this population within the next hundred years.
It has been shown that a triple increase in the carrying capacity of the habitat can increase the probability of survival for a third what, with additional monitoring, would allow the long-term survival of this population of Hermann's tortoise.

AB  - This study investigates the evolution
 of a population of Hermann’s tortoises, located on the edge of the massif des Maures, over a period of
 30 years through capture–recapture monitoring. It shows a considerable decline of 73 % in the number
 of adult tortoises between the early 1980s and 1999; then from 1999, the population stabilized at around
 100 adult tortoises. The fall in numbers during the first period seems to be linked to several factors.
 The 22 % increase in forest cover between 1983 and 1995 increased the concentrations of eggs laid in
 some open areas, making it easier for the species’ natural predators to find them. Mechanized clearance
 of undergrowth carried out in 1989 and 1994 has undoubtedly reduced the size of the population. The
 presence of dogs has posed an additional threat (97 % of the adult tortoises have bite marks and 7 % are
 missing limbs). In addition, the impact of dog bites on the tortoises’ shells has, over time, removed individual
 markings, thereby distorting survival estimates. The stabilization of numbers over the last decade
 seems to be due to the discontinuation of certain practices (notably mechanized undergrowth clearance).
 However, the demographic structure (with almost no juveniles) could soon lead to another decrease in
 population. This situation seems to be specific to this particular population and cannot be applied generally
 to all the populations in Provence

AB  - Assessing population trends is a basic prerequisite to carrying out adequate conservation strategies. Selecting an appropriate method to monitor animal populations can be challenging, particularly for low-detection species such as reptiles. This study compares 3 detection-corrected abundance methods (capture–recapture, distance sampling, and N-mixture) used to assess population size of the threatened Hermann's tortoise. We used a single dataset of 432 adult tortoise observations collected at 118 sampling sites in the Plaine des Maures, southeastern France. We also used a dataset of 520 tortoise observations based on radiotelemetry data collected from 10 adult females to estimate and model the availability (g0) needed for distance sampling. We evaluated bias for N-mixture and capture–recapture, by using simulations based on different values of detection probabilities. Finally, we conducted a power analysis to estimate the ability of the 3 methods to detect changes in Hermann's tortoise abundances. The abundance estimations we obtained using distance sampling and N-mixture models were respectively 1.75 and 2.19 times less than those obtained using the capture–recapture method. Our results indicated that g0 was influenced by temperature variations and can differ for the same temperature on different days. Simulations showed that the N-mixture models provide unstable estimations for species with detection probabilities <0.5, whereas capture–recapture estimations were unbiased. Power analysis showed that none of the 3 methods were precise enough to detect slow population changes. We recommend that great care should be taken when implementing monitoring designs for species with large variation in activity rates and low detection probabilities. Although N-mixture models are easy to implement, we would not recommend using them in situations where the detection probability is very low at the risk of providing biased estimates. Among the 3 methods allowing estimation of tortoise abundances, capture–recapture should be preferred to assess population trends. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Lateralization consists of the differential use of bilateral organs or limbs and is well described in many taxa and in several contexts. Common ecological frameworks where it can be observed are foraging and predatory ones, with benefits related to both visual and auditory lateralization such as faster response or increasing neural processing ability. Anuran amphibians are considered relevant models for investigating lateralization, due to their great ecological variety and the possibility of easily being raised under laboratory conditions. By adopting the "rotational preference test", we used Balearic green toad tadpoles to test the effects of behavioural defensive responses triggered by different predator types (native vs alien, i.e. dragonfly larvae Aeshna cyanea and adult red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii) and diets (fasted vs. tadpole-fed predators) on their lateralization. We recorded tadpoles' responses to five different chemical cues: clean water (control treatment), fasted dragonfly larvae and crayfish, and tadpole-fed dragonfly larvae and crayfish. Green toad tadpoles did not show a bias in a predominant direction, although lateralization occurred at the individual level, as shown by the intensity index (L<sub>A</sub>). Perceived predation risk was the highest in tadpoles exposed to the combined chemical cues of conspecific prey and native predators, which elicited both changes in the intensity of lateralization and a marked reduction in tadpoles' activity level. Our results suggest that contextual predation threat may induce very rapid changes in the expression of asymmetries at the individual level, and might play a role as part of the complex defensive strategies adopted by prey in the attempt to escape predators.

AB  - Testudo hermanni is included as near‑threatened in the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, while T. hermanni hermanni is considered endangered in the Italian Red List. Appropriate management of smuggled or seized wild individuals is recommended before their reintroduction into the wild. Accordingly, a health monitoring study was carried out. During 2014‑2016, 133 oral swabs and 121 cloacal swabs were collected from a total of approximately 180 free‑ranging and rescued T. hermanni hermanni from eight different Italian regions to investigate the presence of DNA of Testudinid alphaherpesvirus (TeAHV), Chlamydia spp. and Mycoplasma spp. in the oral cavity, and Salmonella spp. isolates in the cloaca. Mycoplasma spp. was detected in 52 out of 87 (59.77%) of rescued and in 1 out of 46 free‑ranging (2.17%) individuals; 33 out of 53 (62.26%) Mycoplasma spp. positive samples were typed as M. agassizii by PCR. Salmonella spp. was isolated from 45 out of 121 (37.19%) cloacal swabs, typed into 14 serovars, and characterized for complete antimicrobial susceptibility. A significantly different distribution of Salmonella spp. isolates was found in 2016 in comparison with 2014 and 2015, without any difference between free‑ranging and rescued tortoises. All the tested tortoises were negative for TeAHV and Chlamydia spp. These results are considered a baseline information critical to monitor the dynamics of these microorganisms in free‑ranging and rescued populations of T. h. hermanni, and to correctly approach the management of rescued animals and possible relocation programs.

AB  - Abstract The global trade in tortoises of the genus Testudo was reviewed by using compiled import data from Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) for 1975–2005. A total of 58 importing and 112 exporting countries were recorded as being involved with the Testudo trade. Turkey, the former Soviet Union, the former Yugoslavia, Morocco, Uzbekistan, Russia, and Ukraine accounted for 81% of the recorded exports; whereas, the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States dominated the import market with 67% of the individuals. Testudo horsfieldi accounted for 48% of the exports, followed by Testudo graeca (37%) and Testudo hermanni (13%). A total of 2,062,289 individuals were traded internationally, and of these, 99% were live animals. Of the animals from known sources, 67% were from the wild, and 16% were allegedly captive bred; the source of 70% of all declared trade animals was unknown.

AB  - Although reintroduction programmes are often implemented for recovering animal populations, projects seldom monitor the long-term survival of released animals. In addition, although many releases may occur in the same area, little is known about how the survival of successive release batches is affected by the presence of conspecifics and density dependence. Here, we use multi-state capture–recapture modelling (combining information from recaptures and recoveries) to analyse the survival of two batches of Hermann’s tortoise Testudo hermanni hermanni released in a 10-year interval and monitored for 18 years at the Ebro Delta (western Mediterranean). We also tested whether the released animals experienced lower survival (i.e. a release cost) before becoming familiar with the new environment. Although we used a hard-release method, neither group experienced a short-term release cost. Annual survival of both groups differed and was not negatively affected by density-dependent factors. Annual survivorship of the first group of released tortoises was constant and very high (0.945, SE = 0.011), and similar to that estimated from several natural populations. The presence of a terrestrial predator in 1 year (before the release of the second group) significantly decreased the survival of tortoises (0.819, SE = 0.073). Strikingly, survival of the second batch was significantly lower than that of the first group after the first years of release (0.775, SE = 0.049). Although survivorship for the first group suggested that habitat quality was high, the second group seemed not to acclimate well to the new environment, possibly due to the presence of resident tortoises. From a management perspective, reintroduction programmes of the Hermann’s tortoise are a successful strategy for its recovery. Nevertheless, it seems advisable to avoid: (1) the release of tortoises at the core of well-established populations and (2) areas with a high density of predators, which can jeopardize the reintroduction success, especially when the number of released individuals is small.

AB  - C'est dans le sud de la France que nous avons etudie l'ecophysiologie des dernieres populations de Testudo hermanni hermanni francaises. Les resultats obtenus indiquent que la complexite des habitats et les contraintes alimentaires et hydriques sont a l'origine de l'intensite du cout de la reproduction des tortues en France compare aux autres pays mediterraneens. L'accouplement et l'accessibilite des sites de pontes impliquent des deplacements et des domaines vitaux hebdomadaires beaucoup plus importants en France (maximum : 3,9 hectares). La reproduction des tortues d'Hermann impose l'acquisition d'eau libre au detriment des aliments pour equilibrer les pertes metaboliques liees aux accouplements ou a la diminution de la capacite intestinale des femelles par la ponte. Leur survie impose alors le stockage des reserves energetiques avant et apres l'hivernage, en utilisant des milieux susceptibles de leur fournir plus facilement la quantite d'aliments necessaire. Inversement, l'ete stimule la maximisation de l'energie nette et requiere l'acquisition de grandes quantites d'eau pour optimiser la digestibilite des plantes ingerees, et l'agregation des individus en zones refuges (oleolentisque, forets, mares). Face aux contraintes environnementales, l'investissement reproducteur des femelles est limite dans le temps mais reste constant suivant et les sous-especes alors que l'effet maternel varie. En France, il n'existe pas d'effet "big male", ni "big female", ni de maturite sexuelle precoce. Toutes les femelles sont reproductrices chaque annee et l'ovulation a lieu d'avril a juin grâce a la formation de nombreux follicules. Neanmoins, l'optimisation de l'investissement reproducteur des femelles reste sous le controle de l'acquisition d'eau libre, des reserves effectuees avant le printemps et la ponte avant l'ete. L'absence de ponte apres juin constitue une economie lipidique et hydrique pour la survie des adultes et leur investissement reproducteur futur.

        <jats:p><jats:bold>Background</jats:bold>Hotspots of intraspecific genetic diversity represent invaluable resources for species to cope with environmental changes, and their identification is increasingly recognized as a major goal of conservation ecology research. However, even for iconic and endangered species, conservation strategies are often planned without thorough information on the geographic patterns of genetic variation. Here, we investigated the spatial patterns of genetic variation of the endangered Hermann’s tortoise <jats:italic>Testudo hermanni</jats:italic> in the Italian Peninsula by genotyping 174 individuals at 7 microsatellite loci, with the aim to contribute to planning effective conservation strategies.<jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>Ordination-based and Bayesian clustering analyses consistently identified three main genetic clusters, one spread in the central and northern part of the peninsula, and two restricted to southern Italy and Sicily, respectively. The highest levels of genetic diversity were found in populations of the southern cluster and, in particular, at the northern edges of its distribution (He &gt; 0.6, Ar &gt; 2.8 ), that correspond to areas of putative secondary contact and admixture between distinct lineages. Our results clearly identify a hotspot of genetic diversity for the Hermann’s tortoise in southern Italy. <jats:bold>Conclusions</jats:bold>We inferred the evolutionary history and the spatial patterns of genetic variation of the Hermann’s tortoise in the Italian Peninsula. We identified three main genetic clusters along the peninsula and a hotspot of intraspecific diversity in southern Italy. Our results underline the urgent need for conservation actions to warrant the long-term persistence of viable tortoise populations in this area. Furthrmore, these data add further evidence to the role of southern Italy as a biodiversity hotspot for temperate fauna, claiming for higher consideration of this area in large scale conservation programs.</jats:p>

AB  - Chelonians are among the animal groups with the poorest conservation status. Since tortoises are long-lived species that need very long time to reach sexual maturity, they are extremely vulnerable to human pressure. Despite their endangered status, there are no common strategies for the development of conservation actions. At the “Mediterranean workshop to develop tortoise conservation strategies”, scientists, conservation associations, environmental managers, IUCN advisers and CITES inspectors met in October 2019 in Alicante (Spain). The aims were to update the diagnosis of the conservation status of the Hermann’s tortoise (Testudo hermanni) and the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) and to suggest strategies that guarantee their preservation at the Mediterranean Region. The main conclusions are summarized by:
i) Mediterranean tortoises are wild endangered species that must be protected in, and together with, their natural habitat. Their main threats are habitat loss and fragmentation and pet trade, but we should also pay attention to wildfires, spread of diseases, the introduction of exotic species or lineages and climate change.
ii) Long-term efforts and stablished protocols are needed to accurately diagnose and monitor the conservation status of wild populations, as well as flows among captive and wild animals.
iii)  Tortoise trade should be banned because it threatens the conservation of wild populations of tortoises. Illegal practices related to tortoises should be decidedly persecuted. People should consider tortoises as wild animals that are endangered and deserving of protection. It is possible to enjoy them by responsibly observing them in their habitat.
iv) Tortoises may carry pathogens or parasites and their sanitary status cannot be fully assessed. They should always be considered potential vectors of tortoise diseases and of zoonosis. Hygiene protocols should be implemented when managing them.
v) The researchers attending this workshop aimed to develop a scientific network for the long-term monitoring of graeca and T. hermanni populations in the Mediterranean Region. They will need the support from public administrations.

AB  - Habitat destruction has resulted in the fragmented distribution of numerous terrestrial species, which poses a challenge for conservationists. Furthermore, species management can be further compounded by life history constraints such as low dispersal, hindering the ability of species to recolonize areas they formerly occupied. For these species, a thorough understanding of the local threats and factors that limit their distribution is crucial for effective management. We used occupancy models to examine which factors at landscape and habitat scales (i.e. land uses, fire history, and vegetation structure) explain the presence of terrestrial tortoises within the range of the westernmost isolated population of the endangered Testudo hermanni hermanni in the Albera Range (NE of the Iberian Peninsula). We randomly surveyed 25 sites (75% of the area known with presence of tortoises) of natural woodlands with 5 to 8 replicates per site in spring 2012-2014. From a sampling effort of 148 hours, we only detected 52 tortoises in 12 of 25 transects. These low numbers are evidence of low population densities. Sites with presence of tortoises were spatially aggregated although the species was absent from apparently adequate sites on the edges of its distribution range. Current and historic land-use primarily explained the presence of tortoises. Besides, wildfires and reduction of habitat complexity also participate to explain the distribution of Hermann’s tortoises. We also discuss some aspects of the conservation of Testudo hermanni in relation to our results.

AB  - Spadefoot toads (Pelobatidae, Anura) are rare in the Italian fossil record, being previously recorded only in the late Pliocene of Arondelli (Piedmont Region, northwestern Italy) and in the early Pleistocene of Pirro Nord P21 (Apulia, southeastern Italy). Here we describe for the first time abundant fossil remains of Pelobates syriacus from the lower Pleistocene fissure of Pirro Nord P13 (Apulia, southeastern Italy). These fossils shed new light on the palaeobiogeographical history of Pelobates in the Apennine Peninsula and are the first fossil evidence in Italy for P. syriacus, which currently lives in the southeastern Balkan Peninsula, Caucasus and the Middle East. This extralimital Italian occurrence suggests that P. syriacus has good dispersal abilities, when favourable conditions exist. Dispersal routes to reach the Apennine Peninsula during the early Pleistocene may have been favoured by a low level of the Adriatic Sea during a cold interval, furnishing a new habitat suitable for P. syriacus.

AB  - The species and subspecies of W Palaearctic tortoises include six, which are widespread in southern Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, and four with restricted ranges in the Mediterranean region. The Central Asian Testudo (Agrionemys) horsfieldii GRAY overlaps with Testudo graeca zarudnyiNIKOLSKY in Iran and Afghanistan. The distributions of the remainder border the Mediterranean Sea. Their survival is threatened directly or indirectly by human activity over many years and include habitat destruction (urbanization, touristic development, road-building, scrubland fires and agriculture), bulk pet and food trade collection for export to NW Europe (Testudo graeca graeca L., Testudo graeca ibera PAL-LAS, Testudo hermanni hermanni GMELIN, T. (A.) horsfieldii and sometimes Testudo marginata SCHOEPFF), isolation of populations with restricted ranges (Testudo hermanni robertmertensiWERMUTH, Testudo (Pseudotestudo) kleinmanni LORTET, T. marginata and Testudo graeca floweri BODENHEIMER), and desertification, especially in the Saharan encroachment zone of northern Africa from wood burning, animal grazing and rainfall decrease (T. g. graeca and T. (P.) kleinmanni). A circum-Mediterranean investigation would establish the population status of all species and their habitats. Countries of the Council of Europe and European Economic Community by ratifying C.I.T.E.S. (Washington Convention 1973) have established the extent of the bulk trade. This should only be allowed in captive-bred animals which, like other domestic pets, could be commercially farmed, probably by necessity in the Mediterranean bioclimatic zone.

AB  - Twenty-five years after the preliminary systematic study of the turtle remains (Agrionemys [=Testudo] hermanni and Emys or Mauremys) recovered from Gruta Nova da Columbeira site (Bombarral, Portugal), the results of its review from systematic and archaeozoological perspectives are presented here. Tortoise remains studies from pre-Upper Paleolithic sites worldwide have provided relevant data confirming its role as a dietary supply for hominid populations and informing about their ability to adapt to local environmental resources. The Iberian Peninsula record in general, and specifically, that from Portugal, have yielded substantial evidence to this highly debated topic. In this sense, turtle remains recovered in Gruta Nova da Columbeira site, discovered in the 1960s and the main ensemble chronologically ascribed to the MIS-5 (87.1 ± 6.3 ka BP), offer new information to this debate. Its detailed restudy, has allowed us the identification, justification, and figuration of remains attributed to two Iberian turtle taxa, Chersine hermanni and Emys orbicularis. Therefore, this update on the data concerning the turtle record from Gruta Nova da Columbeira provides new justified taxonomic evidence regarding the Iberian turtle taxa distribution during the Upper Pleistocene. The previously suggested hypothesis about the tortoise human consumption on the site is here evaluated through the development of an archaeozoological and taphonomical analysis, as well as considering the potential documentation of anthropic alterations (e.g., burning, cutmarks, percussion marks). In this sense, this hypothesis is confirmed. In addition, the presence of carnivore activity evidence indicates the engagement of other agents in the deposit formation.

AB  - The Hermann tortoise (Testudo hermanni boettgeri Mojsisovics, 1889) is present in Romania at its range limit. The main range is located in the Southwestern part of the country, in a sub-optimal sub-Mediterranean climate. Testudo hermanni boettgeri is also found in the Southeastern part of the country, the population there being insignificant to be included in our study. The range from Southwestern part of Romania has a surface of ~4420 sq km, from which only ~672 sq km is favorable to the tortoise. From the range extension point of view, the Hermann tortoise is a subspecies with a restrictive habitat, and the population is strongly declining—a tendency that most likely will continue in the future. This decline is accentuated by the habitat loss. The main threats for the Hermann tortoise are due to housing and urban area encroachment, tourism and recreation areas, annual and perennial non-timber crops, mining and quarrying, energy production and mining, recreational activities, increase in fire frequency/intensity, droughts, temperature extremes, climate change and severe weather. The threatened status established according to IUCN criteria for the regional level under uncertainty have led to framing the species in the endangered EN B1ab(i,ii,iii,v) category.

AB  - Sexual dimorphism in tortoise species is prominent, but may vary geographically. Here, we investigated sexual dimorphism of Testudo hermanni and T. graeca from previously unstudied populations in northeast Greece. Females of each species illustrated higher mean values in almost all traits and exhibited better body condition than males. The longer tails and smaller plastron found in males of T. hermanni, and the wider anal notch found in males of T. graeca are believed to be linked with mating success and courtship behavior. When compared to other regions, both our species were found to be larger and heavier in most cases. Our results may be used in future comparative studies, providing additional insights for both species.

AB  - The size-and-age composition of T. hennanni population in the Eminska Mountain the easternmost part of the Balkan Range (Stara Planina), strongly suggests that this population is slowly declining: only 18.6% of the population are animals under 10 years; the size class 161-180 (32.4%) mm and the age class of 16 20 years (28.4%) dominate in the population. The sex ratio is approximately in parity (57.6% males: 42.4% females). Males dominate in the smaller size classes, and there are only females in the largest size classes. The carapace length of the hatchlings varies from 32.5 to 40 mm, the body weight from 10 to 17 g. The linear growth is described by the equation of von Bertalanffy L = 287(1-e-0.0436(t+3.26)). Similar growth parameters are determined in some populations of Greece and France. Regressions of the tortoise body weight (W, g), carapace width (Wd, mm), and carapace height (H, mm) on the carapace length (L, mm) are described by the equations: In W = -3.7452+2.09391n L; In Wd = 0.3635 + 0.8792 In L, and In H = -0.2151 + 0.90881n L, respectively. At the same carapace length, the females have greater average weights and average heights, and smaller average widths than the males.

AB  - <jats:p>Top predators may adapt their diets to changes in prey availability where human-induced environmental changes are intense. This long-term study of the breeding-season diet of Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) in the Strandzha Mountains analyzed shifts in diet caused by the population decline in principal prey species, the tortoises (Testudo hermanni and T. graeca). Tortoises comprised 50.0% of the eagle diet by prey number in the 1990s, but that share collapsed to 5.8% in 2014–2021. During this later interval, Golden Eagles preyed more intensively on lighter-weight prey such as Northern White-breasted Hedgehog (Erinaceus roumanicus, an increrase of 28.2% by number) and Edible Dormouse (Glis glis, an increase of 14.9% by number). Hedgehogs predominated in the diet of an individual eagle nest site for the first time in 1998 and became the principal prey in 2014–2021. Differences in food niche breadth and proportions of mesopredators between tortoise- and hedgehog-dominated individual annual diets were not significant, corresponding to a low level of food stress. The only eagle with an annual diet dominated by Squamata (snakes and lizards) was an exception, having the widest food niche. Young domestic ungulates have almost completely disappeared from eagle diets at the same as the reduction of tortoises, corresponding to a concurrent decline of livestock farming. The results obtained here have relevance to conservation management of both predator and prey populations.</jats:p>

AB  - La Tortue d'Hermann, Testudo hermanni (Gmelin, 1789) et la Cistude d'Europe, Emys orbicularis (Linne, 1758) sont deux especes dont les populations declinent en France. Bien que les diverses menaces aient ete identifiees, il est souvent difficile de quantifier leurs impacts. Dans le Var, le CRCC (Centre de Recherche et de Conservation des Cheloniens) dispose de l'unique centre de sauvegarde specialise dans le soin des tortues francaises. Depuis sa creation en 2002, ce centre permet de soigner de nombreux individus sauvages trouves blesses par des particuliers. Les debroussaillages, les chiens et les vehicules sont les trois principales causes de blessures et de mortalite des tortues. L'impact de ces menaces varie selon le sexe et selon les periodes de l'annee. La majorite des tortues concernees sont adultes. Ces elements peuvent contribuer a orienter les futures actions de conservation, notamment dans le cadre des Plans Nationaux d'Actions.

AB  - During a herpetological survey at the island of Kos, the authors observed Testudo graeca ibera . The portion of tortoises that show a divided supracaudal shield was analysed. This question is of interest because in the literature this is one of the so-called typical characters used to separate it from other European species Testudo hermanni (s.l.). From 115 specimens examined, 8 showed a divided supracaudal, thus 7 % in total. Furthermore significant differences exist between sites. In one place only 2 of 60 had this characteristic, but 5 of 24 at another site. Additionally the authors remark on unexpected differences in morphology (Marginalia) in one population.

AB  - SUMMARY Spontaneous movements and homing were investigated in a wild population of Testudo hermanni Gmelin (Reptilia Testudinidae). The study area was located on a sandy coastal strip between Lago di Burano and the Tyrrhenian Sea, central Italy. Animals were marked and recaptured over a 4 year period. Thread and radio tracking made possible the detailed plotting of the routes of some individuals. Analysis of the distances at which animals were recaptured over periods from 24 hr to 2 years shows the existence of a maximum dispersal value not exceeded when observation time is indefinitely extended. Individuals tracked in successive years during the same season, range the same areas along similar routes. Males show a larger mean recovery distance and a higher vagility than females. Moreover, males saturate their range in about 10 days whereas females need 2–3 months. Tortoises spend their resting period in burrows, pallets or simple spots under vegetation, none of which is strictly individual. Wide intersect...

AB  - A small population of Testudo hermanni boettgeri Mojsisovics, 1889, was discovered and studied in detail in the easternmost part of the Balkan Mountain Range - Eminska Mountain. 57 Testudo hermanni GMelin, 1789, with adult sex ratio males/females of 1.52 were marked and described. Only one male specimen of Testudo graeca ibera Pallas, 1814, was found and marked. The age structure was skewed, low juvenile/ female ratio - 0.19 pointed at an alarming decline of population density. Detailed, continuous observa- tions over the seasonal and daily activity level, territorial and courtship behaviour were conducted in the field and within the enclosed protected 2000 sq. m area. Seven adult females, 3 males and 12 hatchlings were the object of detailed observations in the enclosed protected area. The actual nest excavation and the egg laying process were precisely described, along with some unusual behaviour, the preferred time for nesting was assumedly established. Monitoring of temperatures during incubation period of a natural nest was carried out and the results were compared with the ones measured in an artificial incubator environ - ment. Detailed description of the hatchlings and their development and growth rate during the first 90 days was made.

AB  - Concluding Remarks The range of papers presented at the symposium has highlighted the importance of ha- bitat for the survival of wild populations of Mediterranean tortoises, especially for the W European Testudo hermanni robertmertensi WERNIUTH, which is plainly threatened in its range in southern Europe. No work, regrettably, has been presented on the status and ecology of Testudo marginata SCHOEPFF, restricted apparently to southern Greece. In- formation from H. MENDELSSOHN is, however, particularly welcome on the smallest of the species, Testudo (Pseudotestudo) kleinmanni LORTET (GROOMBRIDGE, 1982). Per- haps the future will see further information presented on Testudo (Agrionemys) horsfiel- dii

AB  - Testudo hermanni) is widely distributed in western and southern Europe. As reptiles exhibit strong geographical variation in most morphological, as well as life history traits, gathering data from distant areas is important. Here we used Elliptic Fourier analysis to investigate variation in pigmentation pattern of plastron (ventral shell) of 54 western Hermann's tortoises (T. hermanni hermanni) studied in different private breeders, and belonging to two different Mediterranean populations: Albera (Catalonia, NE Iberian Peninsula, n=14) and Balearic Islands (n=40). Based on this sample, it was shown that plastral pigmentation design -history, but differences appeared between geographical populations. These results provide a baseline for further comparisons in variation of plastral pigmentation pattern.

AB  - Effective conservation actions such as defining new nature reserve require accurate estimates of the spatial distributions of the target species. Species distribution models provide habitat suitability maps for studied species. In this paper we used Maxent software to estimate the distribution and extent of potential suitable habitat of five amphibian and reptilian species ( Mesotriton alpestris , Bombina variegata , Testudo hermanni , Lacerta viridis and Vipera ammodytes ) in the special nature reserve “Goc-Gvozdac” (Central Serbia) in order to assess how much of the potential habitats is included in this reserve. Comparing produced suitable habitat maps of the species with a map of the special nature reserve “Goc – Gvozdac” we concluded that the reserve boundaries do not coincide with the proposed distribution of suitable habitats for M. alpestris , T. hermanni , L. viridis and V. ammodytes , and therefore this reserve does not contribute much to the protection of local populations of these species.

AB  - Assigning individuals to their source populations is crucial for conservation research, especially for endangered species threatened by illegal trade and translocations. Genetic assignment can be achieved with different types of molecular markers, but technical advantages and cost saving are recently promoting the shift from short tandem repeats (STRs) to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Here, we designed, developed, and tested a small panel of SNPs for cost-effective geographic assignment of individuals with unknown origin of the endangered Mediterranean tortoise <i>Testudo hermanni</i>. We started by performing a ddRAD-seq experiment on 70 wild individuals of <i>T. hermanni</i> from 38 locations. Results obtained using 3182 SNPs are comparable to those previously obtained using STR markers in terms of genetic structure and power to identify the macro-area of origin. However, our SNPs revealed further insights into the substructure in Western populations, especially in Southern Italy. A small panel of highly informative SNPs was then selected and tested by genotyping 190 individuals using the KASP genotyping chemistry. All the samples from wild populations of known geographic origin were genetically re-assigned with high accuracy to the original population. This reduced SNPs panel represents an efficient molecular tool that enables individuals to be genotyped at low cost (less than €15 per sample) for geographical assignment and identification of hybrids. This information is crucial for the management in-situ of confiscated animals and their possible re-allocation in the wild. Our methodological pipeline can easily be extended to other species.

ecological studies are important for understanding wild populations’ dynamics
and processes and the actual factors that can determine their decline. Here, we
report the results of a 28-years-long (1992–2019) monitoring of three distinct
populations of a tortoise, Testudo
hermanni, in Central Italy,
with an emphasis on their population abundance trends and on the eventual
variation in their habitat use across years and among the study areas. Samplings were conducted by Visual Encounter Survey
(VES) methodology, and using a suite of statistical analyses including
correlations and Generalized Linear Models analyses. Our data showed a
statistically significant decline in tortoise sightings through time, and
concurrently also a variation in habitat use by tortoises. In all the three
study areas, we observed a significant increase of tortoise sighting frequency
in the habitat type characterized by high (>taller than 200 cm) shrubby and
wooded vegetation. Since our analyses revealed no significant change in the
habitat type availability by year in each study area, we suggest that T. hermanni was increasingly selecting
closed vegetation spots throughout the years. We hypothesize that this observed
trend of shift in habitat selection could be due to lowering their body
temperatures to prevent overheating. So, the selection of more covered spots
would be a thermal ecology adaptive consequence of the ongoing global warming.

AB  - Variation in a number of morphological characters were analysed in five populations of Testudo hermanni from Serbia and Montenegro. Tortoises from Serbia appeared significantly larger than those from Montenegro. An insular population of Montenegro was distinct due to its extremely small body size and mass and dark plastral pigmentation. Although the majority of tortoises had the supracaudal scute divided, many tortoises had the scute undivided. Effects of possible genetic divergence and/or adaptation to different environmental conditions on observed morphological variation were discussed.
