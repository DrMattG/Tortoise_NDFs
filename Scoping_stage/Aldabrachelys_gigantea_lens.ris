AB  - The Anthropocene is tightly associated with a drastic loss of species worldwide and the disappearance of their key ecosystem functions. The orders Testudines (turtles and tortoises) and Crocodilia (crocodiles, alligators, and gharials) contain numerous threatened, long-lived species for which the functional diversity and potential erosion by anthropogenic impacts remains unknown. Here, we examine 259 (69%) of the existing 375 species of Testudines and Crocodilia, quantifying their life history strategies (i.e., trade-offs in survival, development, and reproduction) from open-access data on demography, ancestry, and threats. We find that the loss of functional diversity in simulated extinction scenarios of threatened species is greater than expected by chance. Moreover, the effects of unsustainable local consumption, diseases, and pollution are associated with life history strategies. In contrast, climate change, habitat disturbance, and global trade affect species independent of their life history strategy. Importantly, the loss of functional diversity for threatened species by habitat degradation is twice that for all other threats. Our findings highlight the importance of conservation programmes focused on preserving the functional diversity of life history strategies jointly with the phylogenetic representativity of these highly threatened groups.

AB  - Aim  Heterophylly is present in many plant species on oceanic islands. Almost all of these plants are island endemics, and heterophylly may have evolved as a response to feeding from large insular browsers such as giant tortoises and flightless birds. We tested this anti-browser hypothesis by feeding Aldabra giant tortoises (Geochelone gigantea) with leaves of native Mauritian plants to see if they distinguished between juvenile and adult leaves and between heteophyllous and homophyllous species.



Location  Mauritius.



Methods  In a choice experiment we recorded feeding response of four captive Aldabra giant tortoises to 10 species of Mauritian plants, of which seven were heterophyllous and three homophyllous.



Results  In general, juvenile leaves of heterophyllous species showed convergence in shape and midrib coloration. Homophyllous foliage was preferred to heterophyllous, and among heterophyllous species adult foliage was preferred to juvenile.



Main conclusions  Several Mascarene heterophyllous plants show convergence in morphology of juvenile leaves and these are avoided by giant tortoises. This indicates a strong selection history from large browsers such as the giant tortoises. The Mascarene example is in accordance with several other comparable cases of plant-large browser interactions from other archipelagos.

AB  - ABSTRAcr. - Schweigger's 1812 original description of Testudo gigantea is translated and analyzed. Among the living or Subrecent tortoise species of appropriate size, this description is found to differ from the known characteristics of the Aldabra tortoises (to which the name gigantea is commonly applied) in seven points; from the Galapagos tortoises in eight points; from the Mascarene tortoises in seven points; but in no aspect is the description incompatible with the South American tortoise Geochelone denticulata. The type locality of "Brazil" is also compatible with this assignation, as are known historical events contemporary to the time when this specimen was acquired and described. Bour's proposal of the substitute epithet elephantina for the Aldabra tortoises is supported, but it is proposed that Aldabrachelys be retained as the genus. This would require action by the ICZN Commission to designate Testudo elephantina Dumeril and Bibron, 1835 as the type species of Aldabrachelys, rather than Testudo gigantea Schweigger, 1812. August Friedrich Schweigger's 1812 work "Prodromus monographiae Cheloniorum" was a milestone in the history of turtle classification. Containing the descriptions of 20 or more new taxa, it has inevitably been frequently cited in subsequent publications in turtle taxonomy. However, because of the great rarity of this work and its Latin text, it is rather rarely read by modern turtle students. Recently I was able to obtain a xerographic copy of Baron Cuvier's own copy of this publication, through the good offices of Roger Bour of the Museum national d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris. Bour also kindly directed me to Schweigger's descriptions of several turtle species, and observed that the quite detailed descriptions given by Schweigger suggested that the modern understanding of the biological species that were associated with these names

AB  - Although some studies investigated lateralization in reptiles, little research has been done on chelonians, focusing only on few behaviours such as righting response and escape preference. The aim of this study was to investigate lateralization in Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea), focusing on asymmetrical positioning of the limbs and the head during resting behaviour, called sleep-like behaviour, involving both wild tortoises and individuals under human care. Subjects of the study were 67 adult Aldabra tortoises (54 free ranging on Curieuse, 13 under human care in Mahe Botanical Garden). For each tortoise observed during sleep-like behaviour, we recorded the position of the head (on the left, on the right or in line with the body midline) and we collected which forelimb and hindlimb were kept forward. Moreover, the number of subjects in which limbs were in a symmetrical position during the sleep-like behaviour was recorded. Based on our results, the number of tortoises with asymmetrical position of head and limb was higher (head: 63%; forelimbs: 88%; hindlimbs: 70%) than the number of tortoises with symmetrical position of the head and the limb. Regarding the head, throughout the subjects found with the asymmetrical position of the head during sleep-like behaviour, tortoises positioning the head on the right (42%) were more than those sleeping with the head on the left (21%). We found a relationship between the position of the forelimbs and hindlimbs during sleep-like behaviour. We reported no differences between Mahe (under human care) and Curieuse (wild) tortoises. Findings of this preliminary study underlined traces of group-level lateralization in head positioning during the sleep-like behaviour, possibly due to a left-eye/right-hemisphere involvement in anti-predatory responses and threatening stimuli as reported in reptiles and other vertebrates. This study aims at adding data on brain lateralization, often linked to lateralized behaviours, in reptiles, especially in chelonians.

Usando el caso de Kiki, una tortuga gigante de Aldabra que se exhibe en el “Museum national d’Histoire naturelle” en Paris, presento tres posibles tipos de textos expuestos en museo que se prestan a nuevas lecturas ecocriticas: etiquetas de museo, expositores biograficos, y restos materiales. Los enfoques ecocriticos a los textos cientificos y biografias animales, y el campo en desarrollo de la ecocritica material han demostrado ser utiles para dar sentido a las narrativas complejas de la historia medioambiental. Contactar con enfoques ecocriticos puede hacer que mejoren las historias sobre los expositores de los museos que cuento como historiadora medioambiental. EnglishBoth environmental historians and ecocritics are in the business of simultaneously analysing the stories we tell about the human-nature relationship and creating those stories. Using the case of Kiki, an Aldabra giant tortoise on display in the “Museum national d’Histoire naturelle” in Paris, I present three potential text types in museum displays which lend themselves to new ecocritical readings: museum labels, biographical displays, and material remains. Ecocritical approaches to the genres of scientific texts and animal biographies and the developing field of material ecocriticism prove useful for making sense of the complex narratives of environmental history. Reaching out to ecocriticism approaches can make the stories I tell about museum displays as an environmental historian better.

AB  - The reproductive activities of one adult female Galapagos tortoise (Geochelone nigra) and three adult female Aldabra tortoises (Geochelone gigantea) were monitored over 2 yr using ultrasound scanning. A nonrestraining technique of tactile stimulation was used for all examinations. Developing, preovulatory, and atretic ovarian follicles, as well as eggs at various stages of shell deposition, were identified and measured. In G. nigra, follicles became preovulatory at a diameter of 40-42 mm and eggs were laid 34-84 days (mean = 55.6, n = 5) after the thin-shelled eggs were first detected in the oviducts. Geochelone nigra was capable of retaining eggs, with the shell already formed, until the next breeding season. No eggs have been produced by G. gigantea during their stay in Zurich Zoo although follicles of 38-40 mm have been observed frequently in two animals.

AB  - <i>Aldabrachelys gigantea</i> (Aldabra giant tortoise) is one of only two giant tortoise species left in the world and survives as a single wild population of over 100,000 individuals on Aldabra Atoll, Seychelles. Despite this large current population size, the species faces an uncertain future because of its extremely restricted distribution range and high vulnerability to the projected consequences of climate change. Captive-bred <i>A</i>. <i>gigantea</i> are increasingly used in rewilding programs across the region, where they are introduced to replace extinct giant tortoises in an attempt to functionally resurrect degraded island ecosystems. However, there has been little consideration of the current levels of genetic variation and differentiation within and among the islands on Aldabra. As previous microsatellite studies were inconclusive, we combined low-coverage and double-digest restriction-associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing to analyze samples from 33 tortoises (11 from each main island). Using 5426 variant sites within the tortoise genome, we detected <i>patterns</i> of within-island population structure, but no differentiation between the islands. These unexpected results highlight the importance of using genome-wide genetic markers to capture higher-resolution genetic structure to inform future management plans, even in a seemingly panmictic population. We show that low-coverage ddRAD sequencing provides an affordable alternative approach to conservation genomic projects of non-model species with large genomes.

AB  - The earliest sediments identified of late Pleistocene age are quiet-water calcarenites, containing abundant molluscs but few corals. As waters shallowed these were replaced by emergent intertidal sediments, probably colonized by mangroves. Further emersion into subaerial conditions resulted in cementation and solution of the limestones to form a dissected karst topography. Perhaps concurrent with this, phosphates, probably originally derived from sea birds, were deposited in open cavities. Further marine withdrawal caused the erosion and re-deposition of these phosphatic sediments at a lower level. A succeeding event was the formation of a sand cay at the western end of the atoll. Its emergent surface was colonized by tortoises, birds, crocodiles and snails, and the youngest deposits indicate the presence of at least seasonal bodies of standing fresh water. This terrestrial interlude was followed by inundation by a sea, perhaps 2-3 m higher than the present level, in which was deposited a fairly uniform limestone over the whole area of proto-Aldabra. The limestone consists largely of calcareous algae set in a calcilutite-calcarenite matrix, in which both corals and molluscs are low in numbers and diversity. The emergence that followed caused widespread erosion and the island formed, surrounded by low cliffs, was subject to solution fretting and a limited deposition of soils. Renewed submergence carved proto-Aldabra into a broad shallow bank, with an almost flat ring-like rim around the periphery, while re-emergence allowed deposition on this bank of a series of sandbanks, beaches and terrestrial soils. These deposits were truncated by a marine erosion surface which marked the beginning of a sea-level rise that continued to a level at least 8 m above present datum, proto-Aldabra (125000 years b.p.) then consisting of a shallow bank covered by coral-rich calcarenite. Coral growth was more prolific around the rim, but coral knolls were also common within the rim to the northwest, where both coral and mollusc diversities are highest. The dominant sediment in the southeast is a Halimeda -rich sand with relatively little coral growth, but the presence of abundant Acropora around the southeast rim suggests that the dominant wind was from this quarter. Early in the deposition of this rock unit a sea-level oscillation resulted in temporary emergence, causing a change in facies or a break in deposition. A subsequent drop in sea level resulted in the cutting of a terrace at about 8 m and a more conspicuous terrace at around 4 m. Aldabra then stood as a ring of narrow, low, rocky islets surrounding a broad shallow lagoon. Deposits with a land-fauna including crocodiles, tortoises and lizards possibly date from this period. Continued depression of the sea level as a result of the Wurm/Wisconsin glaciation left Aldabra as a steep-sided rocky island, perhaps up to 100 m high. This was well vegetated, and a high rainfall caused much solutional erosion. Sea level, in response to post-Glacial climatic warming, has risen to its present position, a principal consequence being the breaching of the land rim and the flooding of the lagoon to reduce the land area by almost 60 %. Small cavity-fill deposits, caves, and stromatolitic coatings have been formed since the last interglacial, but it is difficult to place them in sequence. A restless history, of changes in the size, shape and character of Aldabra had important effects upon both the marine and terrestrial biotas. The giant tortoise, Testudo gigantea , was eliminated and has recolonized the area on at least two occasions; and the faunas and floras characterizing the sediments of each marine event are very different in composition. The evidence presented does not accord with the popular view of reef growth as steady accretion. The limestones were formed as discrete increments, often with dramatic facies changes between one unit and the next.

AB  - The Indian Ocean giant tortoise survives on Aldabra, an atoll north-west of Madagascar. The Bristol Seychelles Expedition estimated the total numbers as 33,000 during visits in 1964 and 1965. Growth and movements were recorded during marking experiments. The growth rate with size is plotted, the time scale being derived from the number of rings on the shields of the shell; and the growth curve is compared with that for captive tortoises.



Variation in many characters of supposed taxonomic value is explained as the influence of environmental factors on the normal growth pattern, and of non-adaptive differences expressed during adult life. The present separation of north and south Aldabra, and Seychelles forms is not supported.



An explanation is suggested for the uniformity of shape among tortoises.



Observations were made on the feeding, diurnal movements and mortality of tortoises on Aldabra.

AB  - Abstract This study evaluates the potential impacts of the release of the giant tortoise, Dipsochelys arnoldi, to vacant habitat within the species' presumed historic range. Five individuals (3 males and 2 females) were released in December 2006 in the isolated Grande Barbe area of Silhouette Island, Seychelles. A comprehensive vegetation survey of all plant species within feeding height of the tortoises in Grande Barbe was conducted. These data, combined with daily feeding observations, were used to calculate feeding rates and diet preferences. Tortoises were observed to have a mean diurnal active time of 257 minutes per day exhibiting a mean feeding rate of 3.86 g of plant material consumed per minute of active time. Individuals were recorded feeding on 18 of 26 recorded plant species, 9 of which were selectively foraged. Species composition of plant species ingested differed between sexes. Males selectively foraged on 6 plant species and females selectively foraged on 7 species. Only 2 plant species we...

AB  - The present case report documents acute ramson (Allium ursinum) toxicosis in tortoises. A group of four captive tortoises, including one Aldabra giant tortoise (Aldabrachelys gigantea) and three African spurred tortoises (Centrochelys sulcata), was fed a large quantity of ramson foliage. Approximately 12 hr later, the giant tortoise and two spurred tortoises developed acute and pronounced lethargy, anorexia, and palor of the oral and conjunctival mucosae. The remaining spurred tortoise showed palor of the oral mucosa but did not display other clinical signs. At initial presentation, approximately 24 hr after being fed with ramson, one spurred tortoise had died, and supportive care as well as the administration of activated charcoal was initiated in the remaining tortoises. While the giant tortoise died 5 days following initial presentation, the other two tortoises recovered. Gross pathological, histopathological, blood biochemistry, and hematological findings largely supported what has been documented in other species with Allium sp. toxicosis. Heinz bodies, however, do not seem to be a consistent finding in the blood of tortoises fed with ramson. Although the development of toxicosis due to the ingestion of ramson in tortoises seems to be dose dependent based on the present report, clinical practitioners and reptile pet owners should be aware of the potential detrimental effects of feeding this herb to tortoises. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of toxicosis caused by an Allium sp. in reptiles.

AB  - Differences in the allometric scaling between gut capacity (with body mass, BM1.00) and food intake (with BM0.75) should theoretically result in a scaling of digesta retention time with BM0.25 and therefore a higher digestive efficiency in larger herbivores. This concept is an important part of the so-called ‘Jarman-Bell principle’ (JBP) that explains niche differentiation along a body size gradient in terms of digestive physiology. Empirical data in herbivorous mammals, however, do not confirm the scaling of retention time, or of digestive efficiency, with body mass. Here, we test these concepts in herbivorous reptiles, adding data of an experiment that measured food intake, digesta retention, digestibility and gut capacity in 23 tortoises (Testudo graeca, T. hermanni , Geochelone nigra, G. sulcata, Dipsochelys dussumieri) across a large BM range (0.5-180 kg) to a literature data collection. While dry matter gut fill scaled to BM1.07 and dry matter intake to BM0.76, digesta mean retention time (MRT) scaled to BM0.17; the scaling exponent was not significantly different from zero for species > 1 kg. Food intake level was a major determinant of MRT across reptiles and mammals. In contrast to dietary fibre level, BM was not a significant contributor to dry matter digestibility in a General Linear Model. Digestibility coefficients in reptiles depended on diet nutrient composition in a similar way as described in mammals. Although food intake is generally lower and digesta retention longer in reptiles than in mammals, digestive functions scale in a similar way in both clades, indicating universal principles in herbivore digestive physiology. The reasons why the theoretically derived JBP has little empirical support remain to be investigated. Until then, the JBP should not be evoked to explain niche differentiation along a body size axis in terms of digestive physiology.

AB  - Background 
Ecological replacement involves the introduction of non-native species to habitats beyond their historical range, a factor identified as increasing the risk of failure for translocations. Yet the effectiveness and success of ecological replacement rely in part on the ability of translocatees to adapt, survive and potentially reproduce in a novel environment. We discuss the welfare aspects of translocating captive-reared non-native tortoises, Aldabrachelys gigantea and Astrochelys radiata, to two offshore Mauritian islands, and the costs and success of the projects to date.


Methodology/Principal Findings 
Because tortoises are long-lived, late-maturing reptiles, we assessed the progress of the translocation by monitoring the survival, health, growth, and breeding by the founders. Between 2000 and 2011, a total of 26 A. gigantea were introduced to Ile aux Aigrettes, and in 2007 twelve sexually immature A. gigantea and twelve male A. radiata were introduced to Round Island, Mauritius. Annual mortality rates were low, with most animals either maintaining or gaining weight. A minimum of 529 hatchlings were produced on Ile aux Aigrettes in 11 years; there was no potential for breeding on Round Island. Project costs were low. We attribute the success of these introductions to the tortoises’ generalist diet, habitat requirements, and innate behaviour.


Conclusions/Significance 
Feasibility analyses for ecological replacement and assisted colonisation projects should consider the candidate species’ welfare during translocation and in its recipient environment. Our study provides a useful model for how this should be done. In addition to serving as ecological replacements for extinct Mauritian tortoises, we found that releasing small numbers of captive-reared A. gigantea and A. radiata is cost-effective and successful in the short term. The ability to release small numbers of animals is a particularly important attribute for ecological replacement projects since it reduces the potential risk and controversy associated with introducing non-native species.

AB  - Case Description—A female Aldabra tortoise (Geochelone gigantea) was evaluated because of focal necrosis of the carapace. Clinical Findings—Debridement revealed a 14.5 × 11.5-cm area of shell necrosis, deep abscess formation, and osteomyelitis involving bacterial (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas spp) and fungal pathogens. Treatment and Outcome—Following extensive debridement, vacuum-assisted closure incorporating silver-impregnated bandaging materials was used. The wound was considered healed after 55 days, at which time a layer of epidermal tissue with progressing keratinization was present, with smooth underlying ossification. Keratinization with normal pigmentation continued over the next 67 days. Clinical Relevance—Findings suggested that vacuum-assisted closure with silver-impreg-nated bandaging materials may provide advantages over traditional methods in the treatment of shell lesions in chelonians, including faster wound healing, improved cosmetic appearance of the hea...

AB  - A microbiome is defined as a complex collection of microorganisms and their genetic material. Studies regarding gut microbiomes of different animals have provided ecological and evolutionary information showing a strong link between health and disease. Very few studies have compared the gut microbiota of animals housed under controlled conditions and those in wild habitats. Little research has been performed on the reptile gut microbiota, and what studies do exist are mainly focused on carnivorous reptiles. The aim of this study was first to describe the overall microbiota structure of Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) and, second, to compare the microbiota of tortoises living under natural conditions and tortoises living in controlled environments, such as zoological and botanical parks, in Italy and in the Seychelles. Seventeen fecal samples were collected from giant tortoises located on Curieuse Island (CI, n = 8), at the Botanical Garden (BG, n = 3) in Mahe (Seychelles Islands) and at Parco Natura Viva-Garda Zoological Park (PNV, n = 6) in Verona (Italy). The V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified in order to characterize the gut microbiota profile. Overall, the major phyla identified were Bacteroidetes 42%, Firmicutes 32%, and Spirochaetes 9%. A higher microbial diversity (alpha indices) was observed for the BG samples as compared to the PNV samples (Shannon: 5.39 vs. 4.43; InvSimpson: 80.7 vs. 25; Chao1: 584 vs. 377 p < 0.05). The results in the present study showed a significant difference in beta diversity between the samples from CI, BG, and PNV (p = 0.001), suggesting a different bacterial fecal profile of giant tortoises at the different habitats. This study provided novel insights into the effects of different environmental conditions on the gut microbial communities of giant tortoises. In particular, differences were reported regarding the bacterial gut community structure between tortoises in natural and in controlled environments. These results could help to improve the management of giant tortoises under human care, thus enhancing ex-situ conservation efforts far from the species geographic range.

AB  - Geochelone pardalis (Bell 1828) shows wide variation of body size in
Africa, with tortoises in the north (Republic of Somaliland) being of comparable
size to insular giant tortoises. Growth data on G. pardalis, the continental giant
species G. sulcata (Miller 1779) and the Aldabran giant tortoise G. gigantea
(Schweigger 1812) were re-analysed using Ford-Walford plots, and their growth
patterns compared. All species and populations fitted a two-phase growth curve,
with initial asymptotic growth followed by slow indeterminate linear growth.
Asymptotic growth was non-Bertalanffy in all groups, with most individuals fitting
Gompertz or logistic-by-mass models best. Juvenile growth (for ages 3-8)
was also approximately linear in all groups. Variation between populations and
species was in the rate of juvenile growth, asymptotic size reached, rate of subsequent
linear growth, and survival rate of older individuals. Geochelone pardalis
from Somaliland had similar juvenile growth rates and asymptotic sizes to other
populations, and their large mean size was due to high survival and continued
linear growth after the asymptote. Geochelone sulcata had similar juvenile
growth rates to G. pardalis, but reached larger asymptotic sizes; indeterminate
linear growth was similar to that of G. pardalis. Geochelone gigantea had much
higher juvenile growth rates than the continental species, reflecting a longer
activity season. Asymptotic size and the rate of indeterminate linear growth were
lower in a high-density (Grande Terre) than low-density (Ile Malabar) population
of G. gigantea. The growth rate of juveniles was not affected by population density,
so that the Grande Terre population had higher growth rates of juveniles relative
to larger tortoises and was the only group to approach Bertalanffy-type
growth, as predicted.

AB  - The extinction of large herbivores, often keystone species, can dramatically modify plant communities and impose key biotic thresholds that may prevent an ecosystem returning to its previous state and threaten native biodiversity. A potentially innovative, yet controversial, landscape-based long-term restoration approach is to replace missing plant-herbivore interactions with non-native herbivores. Aldabran giant (Aldabrachelys gigantea) and Madagascan radiated (Astrochelys radiata) tortoises, taxonomically and functionally similar to the extinct Mauritian giant tortoises (Cylindraspis spp.), were introduced to Round Island, Mauritius, in 2007 to control the non-native plants that were threatening persistence of native species. We monitored the response of the plant community to tortoise grazing for 11 months in enclosures before the tortoises were released and, compared the cost of using tortoises as weeders with the cost of using manual labor. At the end of this period, plant biomass; vegetation height and cover; and adult, seedling, flower, and seed abundance were 3–136 times greater in adjacent control plots than in the tortoise enclosures. After their release, the free-roaming tortoises grazed on most non-native plants and significantly reduced vegetation cover, height, and seed production, reflecting findings from the enclosure study. The tortoises generally did not eat native species, although they consumed those native species that increased in abundance following the eradication of mammalian herbivores. Our results suggest that introduced non-native tortoises are a more cost-effective approach to control non-native vegetation than manual weeding. Numerous long-term outcomes (e.g., change in species composition and soil seed bank) are possible following tortoise releases. Monitoring and adaptive management are needed to ensure that the replacement herbivores promote the recovery of native plants.

AB  - Abstract Aldabra Atoll has the largest population of giant tortoises ( Aldabrachelys gigantea ) in the world. As such an important biological resource, it is necessary to understand how the effects of climate change will impact this keystone species; in particular the frequency of drought, which is likely to affect tortoise habitat. To assess whether drought frequency has changed over the last 50 years on Aldabra, we calculated the standardized precipitation index (SPI) to identify drought periods using monthly rainfall data collected during 1969–2013. We found that drought frequency has increased to more than six drought months per year today compared with about two months per year in the 1970s (t = 2.884, p = 0.006). We used MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy for vegetation activity, to determine how vegetation has responded to the changing drought frequency between 2000 and 2013. We found that Aldabra’s vegetation is highly responsive to changes in rainfall: anomalies in long-term mean monthly NDVI across Aldabra were found to decrease below the mean during most drought periods and increase above the mean during most non-drought periods. To investigate the response of tortoise habitat to rainfall, we extracted mean NDVI anomalies for three key habitat types. Open mixed scrub and grasslands, the preferred habitat of tortoises, showed the greatest decrease in vegetation activity during drought periods, and the greatest increase in average greenness during non-drought periods. Recent analysis has shown vegetation changes on Aldabra in recent decades. If these changes are caused by decreased precipitation, then the increased frequency of drought could impact the tortoise population, in both the short and long term, by limiting the quality and quantity of forage and/or shade availability within favoured habitats, and by changing the habitat composition across the atoll.

AB  - The giant tortoise of Aldabra, Geochelone gigantea, shows quite marked changes in proportions with age, although during growth the relations between the length of the carapace and various measurements of the plastron and scutes involve not only strong but also weak allometry. Certain scutes show a predisposition to split during growth. Accidental damage to the carapace is frequent. Males reach over 100 cm in carapace length but females are smaller, up to 80 cm. There is no segregation between the sexes in any single measurement investigated, except among the very largest animals. A general appraisal of carapace and tail shape is sufficient to sex only animals above 60 cm in carapace length. The number of annuli on each scute corresponds to the number of years of age at least up to the formation of the tenth to fifteenth annulus. A general assessment of the pattern of growth is made by plotting body measurements against number of annuli. Growth curves of individual tortoises are reconstructed by relating measurements of successively formed annuli to age. Growth rate is recorded by plotting the difference between successive pairs of annulus measurements against age. The growth rate of ageable tortoises varies between local populations on South Island and between populations of South and Middle Island. Growth rate declines with age, reaching asymptotes at mean values of between 20 and 30 years. Some individuals exhibit sudden increases in growth rate after several years of very slow growth. There is a well-marked daily cycle of activity, feeding being limited to the early morning and late evening. Agonistic behaviour is virtually absent. Breeding is seasonal and the males select partners from within a limited size range of tortoises. Most mating attempts are unsuccessful. On Aldabra, tortoises occur in a wide variety of habitats, in each of which they depend on a different plant species or vegetational association for food. On coastal plains the chief source of food is Sporobolus virginicus. A variety of small herbs is consumed on the barren stretches of coastal champignon. Distribution in these areas is profoundly affected by the availability of shade. Further inland, the tortoises browse heavily on Guettarda speciosa in woods dominated by this tree. They take advantage of seasonal successions in the vegetation associated with freshwater pools, feeding on each community as it develops. Most of the woody plants near the pools are ignored. On the platin, browsing is selective and the regeneration of some trees is held in check. A very important food source here is the 'tortoise turf' (a sward in which Panicum sp. is often dominant) developed under conditions of heavy grazing and susceptible to erosion by wind and the tortoises themselves. On Middle Island, where the population is small, the tortoises exert very little effect on the vegetation. Associations with other animals are mostly casual, but along the south coast dunes Coenobita rugosus is dependent on tortoise faeces for food. Fossilized tortoise bones have been discovered at many points on Aldabra, deposited in brown limestone. They probably date from before the interstadial of about 30 000 years ago. Some adult tortoises range over 7 km or more, across a variety of habitats, but many individuals appear to be sedentary. The population of South Island is enormous-of the order of 100 000 animals-with a density of about 30 hm $^{-2}$ on the platin. Higher densities are reached in Guettarda woodland. Local variation in numbers, size range and age structure depend on habitat preferences, differential movement of age classes and regional differences in growth rate. Attempts at assessing age class distribution are affected particularly by undersampling of the younger age classes, and the difficulty of counting the worn growth rings in animals with more than about 14. In the census sample, which may itself be an imperfect sample of the whole South Island population, at least 35% of the animals are below 20 years of age and only about 20% can have reached sexual maturity. More than 50 age classes may be present, but this and similar deductions are still speculative.

AB  - Insect populations were sampled at regular intervals, by using Health light traps, throughout a 12 month period at various localities about Aldabra Atoll. Abundance and fluctuations in numbers throughout the year of the predominant orders, families and species of insects are given for localities on West, South and Middle Islands, and Ile Michel. Differences between the composition, diversity and density of insect populations at selected localities are discussed in relation to ecological factors such as vegetation, rainfall and the presence or absence of higher animals, in particular giant tortoises, Geochelone gigantea, and/or colonial breeding birds.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Despite only comprising seven species, extant sea turtles (Cheloniidae and Dermochelyidae) display great ecological diversity, with most species inhabiting a unique dietary niche as adults. This adult diversity is remarkable given that all species share the same dietary niche as juveniles. These ontogenetic shifts in diet, as well as a dramatic increase in body size, make sea turtles an excellent group to examine how morphological diversity arises by allometric processes and life habit specialisation. Using three-dimensional geometric morphometrics, we characterise ontogenetic allometry in the skulls of all seven species and evaluate variation in the context of phylogenetic history and diet. Among the sample, the olive ridley (<jats:italic>Lepidochelys olivacea</jats:italic>) has a seemingly average sea turtle skull shape and generalised diet, whereas the green (<jats:italic>Chelonia mydas</jats:italic>) and hawksbill (<jats:italic>Eretmochelys imbricata</jats:italic>) show different extremes of snout shape associated with their modes of food gathering (grazing vs. grasping, respectively). Our ontogenetic findings corroborate previous suggestions that the skull of the leatherback (<jats:italic>Dermochelys coriacea</jats:italic>) is paedomorphic, having similar skull proportions to hatchlings of other sea turtle species and retaining a hatchling-like diet of relatively soft bodied organisms. The flatback sea turtle (<jats:italic>Natator depressus</jats:italic>) shows a similar but less extreme pattern. By contrast, the loggerhead sea turtle (<jats:italic>Caretta caretta</jats:italic>) shows a peramorphic signal associated with increased jaw muscle volumes that allow predation on hard shelled prey. The Kemp’s ridley (<jats:italic>Lepidochelys kempii</jats:italic>) has a peramorphic skull shape compared to its sister species the olive ridley, and a diet that includes harder prey items such as crabs. We suggest that diet may be a significant factor in driving skull shape differences among species. Although the small number of species limits statistical power, differences among skull shape, size, and diet are consistent with the hypothesis that shifts in allometric trajectory facilitated diversification in skull shape as observed in an increasing number of vertebrate groups.</jats:p>

AB  - Tortoises (Testudinidae) occur in a wide range of environments, providing important ecosystem functions, such as seed dispersal and refuge in the form of burrows. Tortoise movement has previously been shown to be related to resource availability, reproductive status and local environmental conditions. However, understanding of the variables that drive their movement remains comparatively low. We investigated aspects of movement in leopard tortoises Stigmochelys pardalis—the largest and most abundant tortoise species in sub-Saharan Africa—in response to environmental, climatic and individual variables in the semi-arid Karoo, South Africa. We used GPS telemetry to calculate bihourly and daily movement and used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to ascertain important predictor variables. Temperature, distance from water sources, and month were important variables for predicting both bihourly and daily movement. Our results showed that movement increased when individuals were close to known water sources, indicating that individuals close to water resources make regular long distance movements. Movement showed a positive relationship for temperature in both models, whilst rainfall was an important predictor for bihourly movement. Our results displayed aspects of seasonality, with movement highest in spring months, likely related to reproductive activities, although no sex differences were observed. We identified temporal and spatial conditions in which leopard tortoise movement increased. Our results further support the relationship between water as a resource and movement in leopard tortoises. Individuals used one of two basic movement behaviours in relation to water in this water scarce environment. Either an individual’s home range and movements included permanent water resources allowing internal water storage replenishment, or excluded these with reliance on food resources (such as grasses, forbs, and succulents) for water.

AB  - Understanding the extent of morphological variation in the wild population of Aldabra giant tortoises is important for conservation, as morphological variation in captive populations has been interpreted as evidence for lingering genes from extinct tortoise lineages. If true, this could impact reintroduction programmes in the region. The population of giant tortoises on Aldabra Atoll is subdivided and distributed around several islands. Although pronounced morphological variation was recorded in the late 1960s, it was thought to be a temporary phenomenon. Early researchers also raised concerns over the future of the population, which was perceived to have exceeded its carrying capacity. We analyzed monthly monitoring data from 12 transects spanning a recent 15-year period (1998-2012) during which animals from four subpopulations were counted, measured, and sexed. In addition, we analyzed survival data from individuals first tagged during the early 1970s. The population is stable with no sign of significant decline. Subpopulations differ in density, but these differences are mostly due to differences in the prevailing vegetation type. However, subpopulations differ greatly in both the size of animals and the degree of sexual dimorphism. Comparisons with historical data reveal that phenotypic differences among the subpopulations of tortoises on Aldabra have been apparent for the last 50 years with no sign of diminishing. We conclude that the giant tortoise population on Aldabra is subject to varying ecological selection pressures, giving rise to stable morphotypes in discrete subpopulations. We suggest therefore that (1) the presence of morphological differences among captive Aldabra tortoises does not alone provide convincing evidence of genes from other extinct species; and (2) Aldabra serves as an important example of how conservation and management in situ can add to the scientific value of populations and perhaps enable them to better adapt to future ecological pressures.

AB  - A variety of nonhuman animals in zoo and research settings have been the subjects of classical and operant conditioning techniques. Much of the published work has focused on mammals, husbandry training, and veterinary issues. However, several zoos are training reptiles and birds for similar procedures, but there has been little of this work published. Using positive reinforcement techniques enabled the training of 2 male and 2 female Aldabra tortoises (Geochelone gigantea) to approach a target, hold steady on target, and stretch and hold for venipuncture. This article discusses training techniques, venipuncture sight, and future training.

AB  - The reproductive ecology of the giant tortoise (Geochelone gigantea Schweigger) in three isolated populations was studied for 2 years on Aldabra Atoll. Density-dependent recruitment was demonstrated. Nest destruction in the low density area was dependent on the density of mature females providing a mechanism for regulating population size. Increases in annual rainfall and the resultant increase in food availability induced an increase in mean egg mass in the low density area (and thereby total hatchling production), whereas in the high density population mean clutch size, mean egg mass, total number of nests and total hatchling production all increased significantly. Large eggs produced large hatchlings which survived better during the first year than hatchlings from small eggs. Hatchling mortality was 94 and 81% in the first year in the high and low density populations respectively. Recruitment into the 5 year age class (after which predation is considered negligible) had almost ceased in the high density population compared with 0.44 per 100 breeding females per year in the low density population.

AB  - It has been suggested (Temple, 1977) that an obligatory mutualism existed between the extinct dodo (Raphus cucullatus) and the endangered "tambalacoque" tree [Calvaria major according to Owadally (1979), but actually a composite of two species (Sideroxylon sessiliflorum and S. grandiflorum) according to Friedmann (1981)]. Although some of the evidence on which that hypothesis was based is disputed (Owadally, 1979; Temple, 1979), the apparent near absence of natural germination and the thickened structure of the endocarp of the seeds suggest that the tambalacoques (sensu lato) are very specialized plants, requiring some mechanism of endocarp abrasion to facilitate germination. Temple (1977) suggested that the dodo's gizzard accomplished this, and that since that bird's final extirpation in 1681, there has been no natural germination. dne test of Temple's hypothesis would be an accurate aging of the remaining trees, especially since there is disagreement between Temple and Owadally as to the age of those trees. They suggest the trees are 300 and 75-100 years old, respectively, even though their information apparently came from the same source. Friedmann (1981) has recently aged one specimen at between 30 and 50 years, and if other trees are significantly less than 300 years of age, any dodotambalacoque mutualism would at best have been facultative. However, the aspect of the Temple-Owadaily debate that is most surprising to me is the total neglect of an even more logical group of organisms in response to which the thickened tambalacoque endocarp may have evolved. These are the testudinid tortoises of the genus Cylindraspis (Bour, 1984, 1985; Geochelone, according to some authors). The significant enhancement of germination of the Galapagos tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum; Rick and Bowman, 1961) and the prickly pear (Opuntia sp.) by passage through the digestive tracts of the Galapagos tortoise (Geochelone elephantopus), and Berlandier's tortoise (Gopherus berlandieri; Rose and Judd, 1982), respectively, have already been documented. In addition, seeds of many Aldabra Island plant species germinate readily after passing through the gut of the Aldabra tortoise [Geochelone gigantea (=Dipsochelys elephantina according to Bour, 1984); Hnatiuk, 1978] and germination may even be enhanced in some (Stoddart and Savy, 1983). Further, tortoises were undoubtedly abundant herbivorous inhabitants of Mauritius through the Pleistocene (Bour, 1979, 1985; Pritchard, 1979) and until their extirpation in the early 19th century (Auffenberg, 1974; Pritchard, 1979). Closely related species on Rodrigues Island (now extinct) were even observed eating "apples," "dates," and "seeds from trees" 300 years ago (review in Bour, 1981). There is, however, considerable difference of opinion as to how many tortoise species lived on Mauritius into Recent times. At least one species apparently went extinct on Mauritius shortly before humans arrived, and another shortly after (Auffenberg, 1974; Pritchard, 1979). In all, at least seven PleistoceneRecent tortoise species have been described from Mauritius (Auffenberg, 1974), but it is currently believed that these were variants (primarily sexual and ontogenetic) of only two (or possibly three) species (Auffenberg, 1974; Bour, 1979, 1984). Ecologically it is very interesting that two (or more) herbivorous tortoise species could coexist on Mauritius, an island of only 1865 km2. They must have had very different habits as Arnold (1979) suggested was the case for the two closely related tortoise species living on nearby Reunion Island. Based on morphology he speculated that one species (more saddlebacked) occupied more open habitats and browsed higher than the other (more dome-shelled) species. Similar differences probably also characterized the species on Mauritius. It is therefore just as logical to suggest a tortoise-tambalacoque seed coevolution as one involving the dodo. Experimentation with tambalacoque seed germination following mastication and passage through tortoise guts (for example, those from nearby Madagascar or the Aldabra islands in the Seychelles Archipelago) is clearly warranted. Enhancement of germination in such experiments would argue strongly in favor of the natural existence of a tortoise-tambalacoque mutualism prior to the former's disappearance. It would also provide the Mauritius Forest Service with a more natural alternative to the mechanical seed abrasion now used to induce

Rewildingwith taxon substitutes, the intentional introduction of exoticspecies to replace the ecosystem functions of recentlyextinct species, is one way to reverse ecosystem dysfunc-tion following the loss of species interactions [2]. This ishighly controversial [3], in part because of a lack of rigorousscientiﬁc studies [4]. Here we present the ﬁrst empiricalevidence of an in situ rewilding project undertaken asa hypothesis-driven ecosystem management option. OnIle aux Aigrettes, a 25-hectare island off Mauritius, the criti-cally endangered large-fruited endemic ebony, Diospyrosegrettarum (Ebenaceae), was seed-dispersal limited afterthe extinction of all native large-bodied frugivores, includ-ing giant tortoises. We introduced exotic Aldabra gianttortoises, Aldabrachelys gigantea, to disperse the ebonyseeds. Not only did the tortoises ingest the large fruits anddisperse substantial numbers of ebony seeds, but tortoisegut passage also improved seed germination, leading tothe widespread, successful establishment of new ebonyseedlings. Our results demonstrate that the introduction ofthese exotic frugivores is aiding the recovery of ebonies.We argue for more reversible rewilding experiments toinvestigate whether extinct species interactions can berestored.Results and DiscussionWe undertook this experiment on a small island because largevertebrates, and hence their species interactions, were lostrelatively recently [5], because the simplicity of island ecosys-temsfacilitatesassessmentsoftheimpactoftaxonsubstitutes[6], and because islands are potentially easier to restore thanmainland ecosystems [7]. We studied regeneration of theendemic slow-growing hardwood Diospyros egrettarum(Ebenaceae), which once covered the Mauritian island of Ileaux Aigrettes, because it is critically endangered followingintensiveloggingforﬁrewood.Todeterminetheextenttowhichthe ebony forest had been decimated, we surveyed and map-ped all ebony trees in an island-wide survey in 2007. Althoughwe located a total of 3518 adult trees, large tracts of the islandthat had previously been forested remained denuded, eventhough logging ended in the early 1980s (Figure 1).The Dispersal-Limited Ebony TreeDiospyros egrettarum produces large, pungent, oval fruits(mean size 6standard error: length 31.6 3.0 3 width 24.01.5 mm, weight 16.6 6 3.7 g) typically containing eight largeseeds (16.9 6 0.9 3 12.6 6 1.0 mm, 0.86 6 0.11 g) encasedin a sticky pulp and a hard, brittle exocarp. PreanthropogenicIle aux Aigrettes hosted populations of several endemicfrugivorous vertebrates large enough to swallow thesefruits and disperse the seeds; these included giant skinks(Leiolopisma mauritiana) and giant tortoises (Cylindraspisspecies)[8].Sincehumancolonization in thelate16thcentury,these large-bodied terrestrial frugivores have become extinct,leaving Ile aux Aigrettes with only small-bodied frugivoresunable to swallow and disperse the ebony seeds. As a conse-quence, D. egrettarum had become seed-dispersal limited;since conservation and restoration work began on the islandin 1986 [8], ebony seedlings have only been observed undermaternal trees.To determine whether there was a lack of abiotic dispersal,wequantiﬁedthedistributionoffallenfruitsfor18trees.Only7of 7437 fruits were found beyond the canopy, and these werewithin 1 m of the canopy edge. Indeed, for 15 of the 18 trees,all fruits were found directly under the canopy. This is notsurprising, because downhill movement cannot occur onthis ﬂat coralline island and so dispersal is entirely gravityderived. This is a direct parallel to the nondispersal of fruitsby neotropical megafauna following the Pleistocene mamma-lian extinctions [9].Can Taxon Substitutes Resurrect Extinct Interactions?Gianttortoiseswerechosenasourtargetfrugivorestoreplacelost seed-dispersal interactions for three reasons. First, theendemic Cylindraspis tortoises were among the last Mauritianmegafauna to go extinct; they persisted on several offshoreislands until the mid-19th century [8]. Hence, their interactionswith long-lived trees like ebony probably ended within thelifetime of many of the adult trees present today. Second,extant giant tortoises have broad diets and are thereforelikely to eat foods similar to those eaten by extinct tortoises[10]. Third, giant tortoises are low-risk substitutes thatare easy to employ and monitor in small-scale, reversiblerewildingprojects[10,11].WechosetheAldabragianttortoise(Aldabrachelys gigantea) as our taxon substitute because ofitsecologicalandtaxonomicalsimilaritiestotheextinctMauri-tian tortoises [11].Aldabrachelys gigantea as Taxon Substituteson Ile aux AigrettesThe ﬁrst four animals were introduced in 2000.

AB  - The main character used in identifying species of Chelonia is the carapace. The taxonomy of several terrestrial tortoise genera remains highly disputed, due in part to a limited knowledge of the lim- its of variation in many populations. For taxa where substantial captive populations are maintained and play an important role in conservation, there is a need to ensure correct identification. The use of the carapace in identification has sometimes been criticised due to potential problems of distortion caused by captive diets. I studied the effects of diet on two species; Testudo ibera and Dipsochelys dussumieri. I confirmed previous findings that low calcium - phosphorus ratios cause scute pyramiding and that extreme calcium deprivation results in metabolic bone disease. However, even though poor diets result in bone resorption, deposition at points of stress and abnormal fusion patterns, they do not comprimise the taxonomically useful characters of scute proportions, coloration and depressions and they have no impact on the plastron. Such carapace characters and those of the plastron in particular, remain of value in systematics. My study highlights the need for careful examination of the value of taxonomic charac- ters.

AB  - Aldabrachelys gigantea (Aldabra giant tortoise) is one of only two giant tortoise species left in the world and survives as a single wild population of over 100,000 individuals on Aldabra Atoll, Seychelles. Despite this large current population size, the species faces an uncertain future because of its extremely restricted distribution range and high vulnerability to the projected consequences of climate change. Captive-bred A. gigantea are increasingly used in rewilding programs across the region, where they are introduced to replace extinct giant tortoises in an attempt to functionally resurrect degraded island ecosystems. However, there has been little consideration of the current levels of genetic variation and differentiation within and among the islands on Aldabra. As previous microsatellite studies were inconclusive, we combined low-coverage and double digest restriction associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing to analyze samples from 33 tortoises (11 from each main island). Using 5,426 variant sites within the tortoise genome, we detected patterns of population structure within two of the three studied islands, but no differentiation between the islands. These unexpected results highlight the importance of using genome-wide genetic markers to capture higher-resolution genetic structure to inform future management plans, even in a seemingly panmictic population. We show that low-coverage ddRAD sequencing provides an affordable alternative approach to conservation genomic projects of non-model species with large genomes.

AB  - The reproductive ecology of the giant tortoise (Geochelone gigantea Schweigger) in three isolated populations was studied for 2 years on Aldabra Atoll. Density-dependent recruitment was demonstrated. Nest destruction in the low density area was dependent on the density of mature females providing a mechanism for regulating population size. Increases in annual rainfall and the resultant increase in food availability induced an increase in mean egg mass in the low density area (and thereby total hatchling production), whereas in the high density population mean clutch size, mean egg mass, total number of nests and total hatchling production all increased significantly. Large eggs produced large hatchlings which survived better during the first year than hatchlings from small eggs. Hatchling mortality was 94 and 81 % in the first year in the high and low density populations respectively. Recruitment into the 5 year age class (after which predation is considered negligible) had almost ceased in the high density population compared with 0.44 per 100 breeding females per year in the low density population.

AB  - The work Prodromus Monographiae Cheloniorum, published by Schweigger in 1812, has recently been the subject ofseveral studies. One result of these studies—the rediscovery of the Testudo gigantea Schweigger, 1812holotype—triggered an intense debate in The Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature, where, among other issues in dispute,the identity and nature of the specimen indicated as the holotype for the species is put in question. Using historical sources,mostly unpublished, and analysis and comparison of taxidermic characteristics of the specimen with other specimens ofthe same nature, we can clearly trace its origin to the extinct Royal Cabinet of Natural History of Ajuda in Lisbon, fromthe “philosophical journey” of Alexandre Rodrigues Ferreira to the specimens transported to Paris by Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1808, thus helping dispel any doubts regarding the identity and nature of what is being identified as the Testudo gigantea holotype, along with other chelonian specimens. This information is of great importance in the current taxonomicdebate as well as in recognizing the historic importance of the Royal Cabinet of Natural History of Ajuda and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire’s 1808 mission to Lisbon.

AB  - Objectives In recent years echocardiography has become a good diagnostic tool in Zoo Medicine but in some cases, it is still a challenge. In Aldabra giant tortoise (Aldabrachelys gigantea) the big size of animals and the few individuals hosted in Zoo are critical points for the application of this diagnostic technique. The purposes of this research were: to evaluate the feasibility of the diagnostic imaging technique on big-sized turtles; to define the echographic parameters for this species; and to describe the morphofunctional and physiological echographic characteristics of their cardiovascular system. Design Repeated measures in vivo. Setting Ultrasonography systematic description and Doppler analysis of the cardiovascular system of Aldabra giant tortoise were carried out; B-mode examination allowed the evaluation of the kinetics of the ventricle, the atria and the atrioventricular valves. Participants 4 Aldabra giant tortoises (two adult males and two young females) hosted in two zoological gardens. Interventions Echocardiography was performed placing the animals in ventral on a restraining platform raised from the floor, to provide adequate accessibility to the thoracic windows where the probe was placed. No chemical restraint was used. Primary and secondary outcome measures Heart rate, systolic and diastolic areas and volumes, vessel diameters and blood flow velocity were measured. Results Heart rate was 21±4 bpm (range 14–25 bpm). The averages of the diastolic and systolic area indexes linked to the subject weight were: 21±3 cm2 and 9±1 cm2. The aortic annulus diameter in female specimens measured 11.2±0.8 mm, while it measured 21.5±0.3 mm in male species. Conclusion Results confirm the effectiveness of echocardiography as a means to study and evaluate the cardiovascular system of this species even if more studies on a bigger number of patients would be necessary to develop the echocardiography technique.

AB  - 1. The O 2 consumption and CO 2 release of nine giant tortoises Testudo gigantea (weight range 118 g-35·5 kg) were measured at a temperature of about 25·5°C. Four European tortoises Testudo hermanni (weight range 640 g-2·16 kg) were also used. The mean RQ values obtained were 1·01 for T. gigantea and 0·97 for T. hermanni . These values were not influenced by activity or size. 2. The data was analysed by plotting log/log regression lines relating body weight to O 2 consumption. Both maximum and minimum metabolic rates recorded for each individual T. gigantea showed a negative correlation with body weight. For active rates the relation was O 2 consumption = 140·8 W 0·97 , whereas for inactive animals O 2 consumption = 45·47 W 0·82 . 3. The maximum rates were obtained from animals that were observed to be active in the respirometer and the minimum rates from animals that remained quiet throughout. The scope for activity increased with body size, being 82 ml/kg/h for animals of 100 g and 103 ml/kg/h for 100 kg animals. The corresponding ratio between maximum and minimum rates increases from about 2 to 6 for the same weight range. 4. Values for metabolic rate in T. hermanni seem to be rather lower than in T. gigantea . Analysis of the relative proportion of the shell and other organs indicates that the shell forms about 31% of the body weight in adult T. hermanni but only about 18% in T. gigantea of similar size. The shell is not appreciably heavier in adult T. gigantea (about 20%). 5. Data obtained for inactive animals is in good agreement with results of other workers using lizards and snakes. Previous evidence suggesting that chelonians show no reduction in metabolic rate with increasing size is not considered to conflict with data obtained in the present work.

AB  - Abstract Growth patterns of captive-bred Seychelles–Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys/Dipsochelys) were studied. This enabled the comparison of the development of 3 distinct morphotypes variously ascribed by different authors to 3 distinct species or a single, variable species (A./D. dussumieri/gigantea, arnoldi, and hololissa). Geometric morphometric analyses identified differences in growth pattern between the 3 morphotypes of 234 juvenile tortoises reared under identical conditions. In plastral characters, all 3 morphotypes could be distinguished from hatching. Initially, hatchlings were very similar in dorsal view but by 30-cm straight carapace length were distinguishable by relative warp analysis. The arnoldi morphotype is the most distinctive, with constriction in the center of the carapace resulting in the beginning of development of saddle-backed morphology from 30 cm. All 3 morphotypes show 2 distinct growth patterns, one from hatching to 20–30 cm and a different pattern above 30 cm. As thes...

AB  - A young female Aldabra giant tortoise (Adabrachelys gigantea) was presented with anorexia, ataxia, severe constipation and bloating. Analysis revealed liver disease and collected biopsy diagnosed Candida krusei infection. Despite Itraconazole treatment, the tortoise got worse and died. Full necropsy was performed; microbiology showed Candida krusei presence in liver, but histopathology didn't confirm fungal presence with special stains, so scanning electron microscopy was essential to prove a detailed diagnosis of extensive mycosis.

AB  - Summary Tortoises (land turtles) are familiar animals and are generally assumed to be strict herbivores. Their ecological roles are most obvious in giant tortoise species which, due to their size and local abundance, play major roles as keystone species and ecosystem engineers 1 , 2 , 3 . In the Galapagos and Seychelles islands these species are known to play major roles as the islands’ largest herbivores, with exceptionally high biomass and consuming up to 11% of primary production 1 . In addition they act as ecosystem engineers, dispersing seeds, breaking vegetation and eroding rocks 2 . However, as slow-moving poikilotherms most people assume their behaviour to be simple. Here we present video evidence of a Seychelles giant tortoise (Aldabrachelys gigantea) attacking a tern chick and pursuing it along a log. Finally the tortoise killed the chick and was observed to eat it. Other tortoises in the same area have been seen making similar attacks, although those were not fully documented. We believe that the exceptional combination of a tree-nesting tern colony with a resident giant tortoise population has created conditions leading to systematic hunting of birds by several individual tortoises; an entirely novel behavioural strategy for any tortoise species.

AB  - Small island states receive unprecedented amounts of the world’s plastic waste. In March 2019, we removed as much plastic litter as possible from Aldabra Atoll, a remote UNESCO World Heritage Site, and estimated the money and effort required to remove the remaining debris. We removed 25 tonnes at a cost of $224,537, which equates to around $10,000 per day of clean-up operations or $8,900 per tonne of litter. We estimate that 513 tonnes (95% CI 212–814) remains on Aldabra, the largest accumulation reported for any single island. We calculate that removing it will cost approximately $4.68 million and require 18,000 person-hours of labour. By weight, the composition is dominated by litter from the regional fishing industry (83%) and flip-flops from further afield (7%). Given the serious detrimental effects of plastic litter on marine ecosystems, we conclude that clean-up efforts are a vital management action for islands like Aldabra, despite the high financial cost and should be integrated alongside policies directed at ‘turning off the tap’. We recommend that international funding be made available for such efforts, especially considering the transboundary nature of both the marine plastic litter problem and the ecosystem services provided by biodiversity-rich islands.

AB  - Reptiles are animals than have been neglected in the research for all times. Some people have the opinion that these animals have fewer needs and demand less from their caretakers. The Aldabra Giant Tortoise lives on the Aldabra atoll outside the coast of Tanzania. The Aldabra tortoise population has varied throughout the years, but today the population is around 100.000 animals. 

The purpose of this study was to analyze the enclosure utilization of two Aldabra tortoises, a male and a female, at Parken Zoo in Eskilstuna, Sweden. The observations were carried out during a 10 days period, and gave a total of 28 hours of observation. The observation method was continuous registration and behavioral observations combined with timekeeping. The enclosure consisted of an indoor space that was divided into different zones and an ethogram was established. 

The results were unequal for the male and the female tortoises. The male preferred to be in the big and open areas of the enclosure. The female on the other hand preferred to stay in the feeding area and in the big area in the front of the enclosure. The female also favored the pool and the heating lights, which the male not equally interested in. The most frequently performed behavior was movement.

A contribution factor to the results may be the Aldabra giant tortoise thermoregulation behavior. Other factors that affect the result can be physiological differences between the two tortoises. It can be concluded that there is a need of more research about the Aldabra giant tortoise and also about other reptiles. This needs to be expanded so we can ensure excellent welfare for our zoo animals.

AB  - The effectiveness of a ‘permanent’ marking technique developed for Giant Aldabra tortoises in 1969 is assessed. Eleven to 16 years after tagging, 59% of the marked tortoises on the west and south coasts of the Atoll had lost their tags. Half-life of the tag is estimated to be less than 10 years and, hence, unacceptable given the long time for maturity and long life span of the Giant tortoise. A modification of the tagging technique is required.

AB  - An adult female Aldabra giant tortoise (Geochelone gigantea) was found dead with a 2 month-history of decreased appetite. At necropsy, multiple ulcers were seen in the mucosa of stomach and colon. Histopathologically, the ulcers were characterized by extensive necrosis, hemorrhage, and marked edema, along with numerous chlamidospores and aseptate fungal hyphae. Fungal structures infiltrated into the lamina propria, submucosa and muscle layer; their invasion into blood vessels formed thrombosis. Immunohistochemically, the fungal structures were strongly positive with an antibody against Candida spp. This case is the first report on gastrointestinal candidiasis in an Aldabra giant tortoise.

AB  - The results of a two year field study of the endemic giant tortoise population (Geochelone gigantea) on the western Indian Ocean atoll of Aldabra are described. The work entailed an extensive sample census from which the size of the population was estimated to be 150 000 individuals. A large scale marking programme was also carried out. 6882 tortoises (4.6% of the total population) have now been individually marked and measured. Tortoises are unevenly distributed over the atoll with local densities ranging from 0 to 217 per hectare. Various environmental factors are considered in relation to their distribution. A method of age estimation, based on growth ring counts, is described and the characteristics of populations in high and low density areas are compared. Analysis of preliminary recapture information shows that the majority of tortoises are relatively sedentary in their habits, although some are capable of long distance movements; and that individual growth rate is density dependent. The remains of 643 natural tortoise mortalities were examined. Life tables of survivorship and mortality were calculated for the tortoise population in the southeast of the atoll. Crude estimates of mortality and recruitment indicate that the tortoise population in that area is on the decline. Tortoise biomass estimates are far in excess of those for other natural tropical ecosystems with similar rainfall. The vegetation in the southeast is being greatly modified by tortoise activity and there is every indication that the tortoise population there exceeds 'the stable carrying capacity'.

AB  - Giant tortoises are among the longest-lived vertebrate animals and, as such, provide an excellent model to study traits like longevity and age-related diseases. However, genomic and molecular evolutionary information on giant tortoises is scarce. Here, we describe a global analysis of the genomes of Lonesome George-the iconic last member of Chelonoidis abingdonii-and the Aldabra giant tortoise (Aldabrachelys gigantea). Comparison of these genomes with those of related species, using both unsupervised and supervised analyses, led us to detect lineage-specific variants affecting DNA repair genes, inflammatory mediators and genes related to cancer development. Our study also hints at specific evolutionary strategies linked to increased lifespan, and expands our understanding of the genomic determinants of ageing. These new genome sequences also provide important resources to help the efforts for restoration of giant tortoise populations.

AB  - Aims The use of exotic species as taxon substitutes to restore lost ecological interactions is currently hotly debated. Aldabrachelys gigantea giant tortoises have recently been introduced to three islands in the Mascarene archipelago (Ile aux Aigrettes, Round Island and Rodrigues) to resurrect herbivory and seed dispersal functions once performed by extinct giant tortoises. However, potential unintended impacts by frugivore substitutes on native ecosystems, e.g. whether they will facilitate the germination of exotic plant species, are largely unknown. We investigated whether A. gigantea introduced to Rodrigues in 2006 could enhance the germination percentage of four widespread fleshy-fruited exotic species on the island. Using germination trials to forecast unintended impacts that could arise from the introduction of a frugivorous taxon substitute enables conservation managers to limit potential adverse negative interactions before they occur. Methods In germination trials that ran over 4 months, we investigated the effects of ingestion (gut passage and deposition in faeces) by subadult and adult A. gigantea on the germination percentage of four exotic fleshy-fruited plant species introduced to Rodrigues. We fed fruits of these plant species to sub-adult and adult A. gigantea to test how variation in age and size of the frugivore would affect seed germination. Feeding of distinctly coloured plastic pellets together with the fruits allowed us to test for individual tortoise effects on seed germination. Important Findings Ingestion by A. gigantea increased the percentage of seeds germinating of Mimusops coriacea and Lantana camara ,b ut not percentage of germination of Veitchia merrillii or Wikstroemia indica. Seeds were more likely to germinate following ingestion by sub-adult rather than adult tortoises, which may be a consequence of the shorter gut passage time observed for sub-adults. Our results demonstrate that introduced frugivorous taxon substitutes could facilitate germination of exotic and invasive plants and highlight the need for conservation managers to weigh the risk of taxon substitutes potentially facilitating the germination and recruitment of exotic fleshy-fruited plants against the benefit of restoring lost seed dispersal functions of threatened indigenous plants. Our findings also highlight the importance of considering age and size variation in frugivores, in particular in long-lived taxa such as giant tortoises, when studying ingestion effects on the germination performance of plants.

AB  - ABSTRACT Twenty immobilizations, for various minor clinical procedures, were performed on 12 adult and sub-adult leopard, Geochelone pardalis, yellow foot, Geochelone denticulata, and Aldabra, Aldabrachelys gigantea, tortoises with a combination of medetomidine and ketamine. An intravenous dose rate of 100 μg/kg medetomidine for leopard and yellow foot tortoises and 25 - 80 μg/kg for Aldabra tortoises resulted in induction times (time from drug injection until the head could be pulled out and the mouth opened) that ranged between 4 and 16 minutes (median 10) and 15 - 45 minutes (45) respectively. Recovery times (time from drug injection until the tortoise was able to withdraw its head with strength) using intravenous atipamezole at a dose rate of 400 μg/kg for leopard and yellow foot and 100 - 380 μg/kg for Aldabra tortoises ranged between 2 and 30 minutes (5) and 5 - 15 minutes (5) respectively. Most (90%) of leopard and yellow foot tortoises experienced a drop in heart rate from baseline following medet...

AB  - Seed dispersal through endozoochory is a critical ecosystem function worldwide. Seed gut retention time (GRT; the duration that seeds are retained in the digestive tract) is an important part of the qualitative component of the seed dispersal effectiveness framework. GRT is a major determinant of when and how far away seeds are dispersed, aiding seeds in escaping predation in space as well as in time. In this study, we examined whether the size of the disperser and/or the size of the ingested seeds affect the GRT in Aldabra Giant Tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) on Aldabra Atoll, Seychelles. We selected tortoises of varying body mass (mean ± 1 SD = 48.6 ± 27.2 kg, range = 0.6–104.0 kg) and fed them different-sized artificial seeds (plastic beads; 2, 4.5, and 10 mm diameter). Tortoises defecated the first beads a mean of 12.0 ± 2.7 d after ingestion, and the last beads 20.4 ± 6.0 d after ingestion. Mean GRT was 14.6 ± 3.7 d. We show that neither tortoise body size nor bead size had an effect on the patterns and time of defecation. We discuss the relevance of our result for seed dispersal and for rewilding projects that use Aldabra Giant Tortoises as substitute species for extinct giant tortoises on other oceanic islands.

AB  - Background Hematologic and plasma biochemical evaluations are routinely used in evaluating the chelonian patient, but appropriate processing techniques have been minimally defined. Objectives This study was designed to compare the effects of temperature, time, anticoagulant, and species on sodium and potassium values in the Aldabra tortoise (Geochelone gigantea) and the Burmese mountain tortoise (Manouria emys). Methods Blood samples from 7 Aldabra tortoises and 8 Burmese mountain tortoises were collected into tubes without anticoagulant and tubes containing lithium heparin. Sodium and potassium concentrations were measured by flame photometry in serum and plasma harvested immediately after collection and from aliquots of whole blood stored at 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C for 5 to 120 minutes. Results In Aldabra tortoises, storage time and temperature had no significant effect on potassium concentrations in heparinized blood and in blood without anticoagulant. However, sodium concentrations in serum and plasma decreased significantly in samples without anticoagulant stored at 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C and in heparinized samples stored at 4 degrees C. In Burmese mountain tortoises, potassium concentrations in serum and plasma increased significantly with time in samples without anticoagulant and in heparinized samples stored at 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C, but the increases were less at 4 degrees C. Sodium concentrations in serum and plasma decreased significantly in blood without anticoagulant and heparinized blood stored at 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C. Conclusions Storage of blood samples with and without anticoagulant at 4 degrees C significantly improved the stability of potassium and sodium concentrations in both species of tortoises. Early separation of red cells from serum or plasma after blood collection is especially important to ensure the reliability of potassium measurements.

AB  - Abstract The evaluation of offspring sex ratios is important in any large-scale threatened species breeding programs if temperature-dependent sex determination is a possibility. We assessed the sex ratio in captive-bred juvenile Aldabra tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea or Dipsochelys dussumieri) at the La Vanille Crocodile and Tortoise Park in Mauritius. The gonads of small juvenile Aldabra tortoises are thin and elongate and fixed to the dorsal part of the body cavity, with ovaries appearing as transparent sheaths with some visible oocytes and testes appearing as small, transparent, thin, sausage-like structures with a net of fine blood vessels on the surface. With growth, ovaries expand and masses of previtellogenic follicles appear on the surface; testes first turn pinkish-white and then yellowish, with tubular structures visible through a thin, transparent theca containing a network of fine blood vessels but no melanocytes. Three tortoises had both testes and ovaries and were classified as intersexes...

AB  - We studied the temperature relations of wild and zoo Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) focusing on (1) the relationship between environmental temperature and tortoise activity patterns (n = 8 wild individuals) and (2) on tortoise body temperature fluctuations, including how their core and external body temperatures vary in relation to different environmental temperature ranges (seasons; n = 4 wild and n = 5 zoo individuals). In addition, we surveyed the literature to review the effect of body mass on core body temperature range in relation to environmental temperature in the Testudinidae. Diurnal activity of tortoises was bimodally distributed and influenced by environmental temperature and season. The mean air temperature at which activity is maximized was 27.9°C, with a range of 25.8-31.7°C. Furthermore, air temperature explained changes in the core body temperature better than did mass, and only during the coldest trial, did tortoises with higher mass show more stable temperatures. Our results, together with the overall Testudinidae overview, suggest that, once variation in environmental temperature has been taken into account, there is little effect of mass on the temperature stability of tortoises. Moreover, the presence of thermal inertia in an individual tortoise depends on the environmental temperatures, and we found no evidence for inertial homeothermy. Finally, patterns of core and external body temperatures in comparison with environmental temperatures suggest that Aldabra giant tortoises act as mixed conformer-regulators. Our study provides a baseline to manage the thermal environment of wild and rewilded populations of an important island ecosystem engineer species in an era of climate change.

AB  - Evolution of population structure on islands is the result of physical processes linked to volcanism, orogenic events, changes in sea level, as well as habitat variation. We assessed patterns of genetic structure in the giant tortoise of the Aldabra atoll, where previous ecological studies suggested population subdivisions as a result of landscape discontinuity due to unsuitable habitat and island separation. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences and allelic variation at 8 microsatellite loci were conducted on tortoises sampled in 3 locations on the 2 major islands of Aldabra. We found no variation in mtDNA sequences. This pattern corroborated earlier work supporting the occurrence of a founding event during the last interglacial period and a further reduction in genetic variability during historical time. On the other hand, significant population structure recorded at nuclear loci suggested allopatric divergence possibly due to geographical barriers among islands and ecological partitions hindering tortoise movements within islands. This is the first attempt to study the population genetics of Aldabra tortoises, which are now at carrying capacity in an isolated terrestrial ecosystem where ecological factors appear to have a strong influence on population dynamics.

AB  - The Aldabran giant tortoise is one of the few testudines that feeds in dense herds, and in so doing the animals frequently exhibit a conspicuous orientation away from the sun. This orientation is most marked when ambient temperature is high, and it breaks down when the tortoises are shielded from direct sunlight. It was previously hypothesized that negative heliotaxis is related to thermoregulation-to reduce heat inflow to the exposed anterior appendages and instead expose the protected posterior of the shell. There has been no test of the thermoregulatory function, and pilot experiments indicate that orientation away form the sun occurs to reduce direct glare into the tortoise's eyes. The glare of the sun seems to interfere with accurately oriented biting movements and reduce feeding efficiency. Speed and intensity of reaction to solar glare is inversely related to the animal's body size. The possibility of a thermoregulatory component to the away-from-the-sun orientation cannot be discounted, but it must be investigated directly.

AB  - Research on the evolutionary and mechanistic aspects of aging and longevity has a reductionist nature, as the majority of knowledge originates from experiments on a relatively small number of systems and species. Good examples are the studies on the cellular, molecular, and genetic attributes of aging (senescence) that are primarily based on a narrow group of somatic cells, especially fibroblasts. Research on aging and/or longevity at the organismal level is dominated, in turn, by experiments on Drosophila melanogaster, worms (Caenorhabditis elegans), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and higher organisms such as mice and humans. Other systems of aging, though numerous, constitute the minority. In this review, we collected and discussed a plethora of up-to-date findings about studies of aging, longevity, and sometimes even immortality in several valuable but less frequently used systems, including bacteria (Caulobacter crescentus, Escherichia coli), invertebrates (Turritopsis dohrnii, Hydra sp., Arctica islandica), fishes (Nothobranchius sp., Greenland shark), reptiles (giant tortoise), mammals (blind mole rats, naked mole rats, bats, elephants, killer whale), and even 3D organoids, to prove that they offer biogerontologists as much as the more conventional tools. At the same time, the diversified knowledge gained owing to research on those species may help to reconsider aging from a broader perspective, which should translate into a better understanding of this tremendously complex and clearly system-specific phenomenon.

AB  - Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) are currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. However, negative impacts of sea-level rise are predicted to result in an overall population decline of 40-65 % over the next 100 years, rendering the species Endangered. Captive propagation is an important tool for in- and ex-situ species conservation, but breeding success outside the tortoises’ native island habitats has been very limited. Until now, the reproductive cycle of Aldabra tortoises has only been described in anatomic and behavioural studies. During a one-year period, plasma of four female and four male wild tortoises on Aldabra Atoll were examined monthly for levels of gonadal steroid hormones (oestradiol, testosterone, progesterone). Plasma oestradiol and testosterone values as well as meteorological data of the sampling period corresponded to previously published reports on seasonal changes in anatomy, behaviour and climate on the Aldabra Atoll. Seasonal changes in plasma testosterone were evident in males, with high values from January through April, reflecting previously described testicular growth and breeding season, followed by a nadir in August and September. In females, plasma oestradiol levels displayed seasonal changes, coinciding with reported ovarian growth from January to May. The obtained data provide prerequisite knowledge for endocrinological monitoring of reproductive processes and management of breeding programs, both ex-situ as in-situ, to establish reserve- and rewilded populations.

AB  - The labyrinth of the vertebrate inner ear is a sensory system that governs the perception of head rotations. Central hypotheses predict that labyrinth shape and size are related to ecological adaptations, but this is under debate and has rarely been tested outside of mammals. We analyze the evolution of labyrinth morphology and its ecological drivers in living and fossil turtles, an understudied group that underwent multiple locomotory transitions during 230 million years of evolution. We show that turtles have unexpectedly large labyrinths that evolved during the origin of aquatic habits. Turtle labyrinths are relatively larger than those of mammals, and comparable to many birds, undermining the hypothesis that labyrinth size correlates directly with agility across vertebrates. We also find that labyrinth shape variation does not correlate with ecology in turtles, undermining the widespread expectation that reptilian labyrinth shapes convey behavioral signal, and demonstrating the importance of understudied groups, like turtles.

AB  - Today, the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Aldabra Atoll is home to about 100 000 giant tortoises, Aldabrachelys gigantea , whose fossil record goes back to the Late Pleistocene. New Late Pleistocene fossils (age ca . 90–125 000 years) from the atoll revealed some appendicular bones and numerous shell fragments of giant tortoises and cranial and postcranial elements of crocodylians. Several tortoise bones show circular holes, pits and scratch marks that are interpreted as bite marks of crocodylians. The presence of a Late Pleistocene crocodylian species, Aldabrachampsus dilophus , has been known for some time, but the recently found crocodylian remains presented herein are distinctly larger than those previously described. This indicates the presence of at least some larger crocodylians, either of the same or of a different species, on the atoll. These larger crocodylians, likely the apex predators in the Aldabra ecosystem at the time, were well capable of inflicting damage on even very large giant tortoises. We thus propose an extinct predator–prey interaction between crocodylians and giant tortoises during the Late Pleistocene, when both groups were living sympatrically on Aldabra, and we discuss scenarios for the crocodylians directly attacking the tortoises or scavenging on recently deceased animals.

AB  - The complete mitochondrial genome of the Aldabra giant tortoise [Aldabrachelys gigantea (Schweigger, 1812): Reptilia, Testudines, Testudinidae] was sequenced using a shotgun approach on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). This genome was 16 467 bp long and presents the typical organization found in vertebrates. The mean coverage of sequencing was 116×. A phylogenetic analysis of the Testudinidae confirms the placement of Aldabrachelys in an Indian Ocean group (including Madagascar). This mitogenome constitutes a reference for ancient DNA analyses of the extinct Madagascan lineages of Aldabrachelys.

AB  - In December 2004 an Aldabra giant tortoise Dipsochelys dussumieri was washed ashore on the coast of east Africa, probably having been carried off the shore of Aldabra atoll, 740 km away. Although trans‐oceanic dispersal is assumed to be the mechanism by which tortoises and many other animals became established on islands throughout the world, this is the first direct evidence of a tortoise surviving such a sea‐crossing.

AB  - Recent research has uncovered many complex cognitive traits and affective processes in many reptile species, such as the ability to make choices that are rewarding or pleasurable. The investigation herein was initiated after many years of anecdotal reports, and preliminary observations, that the two male Aldabran giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea), Wilbur and Little John, at Melbourne Zoo (Melbourne, Australia) would approach the fence-line of their enclosure, sometimes multiple times daily, to "solicit" interactions from zoo visitors and/or zoo staff. Following other research with Galapagos giant tortoises (Geochelone nigra), this experiment was a novel preference test with two male Aldabran giant tortoises to assess their individual preferences for three stimuli: (1) human interaction (shell and neck rubs provided using hands); (2) food (highly palatable carrot pieces); and (3) an "enrichment" ball (a red "boomer ball"). The results found that Wilbur highly preferred human interaction and food over the ball; whereas Little John preferred food, and showed some initial interest in the ball, but did not approach the human on any of his 13 human interaction trials. These results reflect previous published findings, that human interaction is a preferred "enrichment," but is dependent upon a multitude of other contextual factors, and is not preferred at all times by all individuals. Individual variation may be very important to understand to have greater positive effect on the welfare-related needs of each giant tortoise housed in captivity. Further research is clearly required to enhance the welfare and well-being of many types of zoo-housed reptiles.

AB  - The population sizes of most Seychelles reptiles was assessed through transects and focal counts for squamates and literature reviews for chelonians. Population density estimation tested several different sampling methods: transects, focal counts, leaf-litter quadrats and drift fences. Transects were suitable for estimating populations of skinks and snakes. Focal counts were more effective for geckos. Population assessments are made for all species except the cryptic Urocotyledon inexpectata. The data presented here allow the first attempt to assign IUCN Red List categories to all Seychelles reptiles; nine taxa are considered to be Vulnerable (Ailuronyx tachyscopaeus, Ailuronyx trachygaster, Dipsochelys dussumieri, Janetaescincus veseyfitzgeraldi, Phelsuma a. abbotti, P. abbotti sumptio, Phelsuma sundbergi ladiguensis, Trachylepis wrightii and Zonosauraus madagascarienis insularis), four Endangered (Chelonia mydas, J. braueri, Lamprophis geometricus and Lycognathophis seychellensis) and three Critically Endangered (Eretmochelys imbricata, Pelusios subniger parietalis and P. castanoides intergularis) The major threats to these species are intrinsically small ranges, habitat deterioration and, for some species,

AB  - Abstract Tetrameric hemoglobins (Hbs) A and D were isolated from red blood cells of the Aldabra giant tortoises, Geochelone gigantea, by a hydrophobic interaction chromatography. After reduction and S-pyridylethylation, two sets of two types of α-chains (α-1 and α-2) and one β-chain were purified from the major Hb A and minor Hb D in molar ratios of about 1:1:2, respectively, by a reversed-phase column chromatography. The complete amino acid sequences of the three globin-chains from Hb A were determined: 141 amino acid residues for the two α-chains and 146 amino acid residues for the β-chain. Using computer analysis (amino acid maximum homology), the two α-chains shared a 96.5% sequence identity and had low sequence identities (37.8% for α-1 and 35.8% for α-2) with the β-chain of the same species, G. gigantea. We constructed a phylogenetic tree of 28 primary globin structures from Reptilia (7 species of squamates, 4 species of turtles, 3 species of crocodiles and 1 species of sphenodontids), including the...

AB  - Tortoises belong to the taxonomic family Testudinidae, which is considered one of the most imperiled families of the order Testudines. Anesthesia is often required for the medical and surgical management of large tortoises. The objectives of this retrospective study were to review drug regimens used to successfully anesthetize Galapagos (Chelonoidis nigra), Aldabra (Aldabrachelys gigantea) and African spurred (Centrochelys sulcata) tortoises, and to compare the times to effect and to extubation in tortoises administered different premedication protocols. Anesthetic records of giant tortoises admitted to the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine between January 2009 and December 2019 were reviewed. A total of 34 tortoises (six Aldabra, 23 Galapagos, and five African spurred) were included, resulting in 64 anesthetic events. Frequently used premedication protocols included an α2-adrenergic agonist and ketamine combined with either midazolam (group α2-adrenergic agonist, midazolam, ketamine, AMK; n = 34), a μ-opioid receptor agonist (group α2-adrenergic agonist, μ-opioid receptor agonist, ketamine, AOK; n = 13), or a μ-opioid receptor agonist and midazolam (group α2-adrenergic agonist, midazolam, μ-opioid receptor agonist, ketamine, AMOK; n = 10). Inhalant anesthetics (isoflurane, n = 21; sevoflurane, n = 23) were frequently used for maintenance of anesthesia following premedication. Out of the 34 total tortoises, 22 had only one anesthetic event, five had two anesthetic events, three had three anesthetic events, and four had four or more anesthetic events. Few adverse effects were observed and there was no mortality reported during the peri-anesthetic period. Sedation and general anesthesia of giant tortoises can be successfully performed with a combination of an α2-adrenergic agonist and ketamine in combination with midazolam and/or a μ-opioid receptor agonist.

AB  - The complete primary structures of αD-2- and β-globin of hemoglobin D (Hb D) from the Aldabra giant tortoise, Geochelone gigantea, have been constructed by amino acid sequencing analysis in assistance with nucleotide sequencing analysis of PCR fragments amplified using degenerate oligo-nucleotide primers. Using computer-assisted sequence comparisons, the αD-2-globin shared a 92.0% sequence identity versus αD-globin of Geochelone carbonaria, a 75.2% versus αD-globin of Aves (Rhea americana) and a 62.4% versus αA-globin of Hb A expressed in adult red blood cells of Geochelone gigantea. Additionally, judging from their primary structures, an identical β-globin was common to the two hemoglobin components, Hb A and Hb D. The αD-2- and β-globin genes contained the three-exon and twointron configurations and showed the characteristic of all functional vertebrate hemoglobin genes except an abnormal GC dinucleotide instead of the invariant GT at the 5′ end of the second intron sequence. The introns of αD-2-globin ...

AB  - Summary

Necropsy examination of a male giant Aldabra tortoise (Testudo gigantea Schweigger), reported to have died suddenly, revealed an upper intestinal obstruction due to a 180' clockwise torsion of the intestine. The torsion involved the duodenum and proximal ileum. There were haemorrhagic enteritis, peritonitis, fatty degeneration of the hepatocytes and haemosiderosis of the spleen. Death was probably due to severe shock, acute anaemia, peritonitis and toxaemia.



Resume

L'examen d'autopsie chez une Tortue Geante d'Aldabra mâle (Testudo gigantea Schweigger) morte subitement, a revele une obstruction de la partie superieure de l'intestin due a une torsion de 180° dans le sens des aiguilles d'une montre. La torsion comprenait le duodenum et le proche ileon. II y avait une enterite hemorragique, une peritonite, une degenerescence graisseuse des hepatocytes et une hernosiderose de la rate. La mort etait probablement due a un choc severe, une anemie aigue, une peritonite et une toxemie.

AB  - Since 1877 it has been assumed that human exploitation led to the extinction of all Indian Ocean giant tortoises except for the Aldabran Dipsochelys dussumieri. A taxonomic review in 1998 proposed that two further species survived in captivity. Some recent molecular studies question the validity of these taxa. All available evidence is re-examined in a discussion of the identity of the Seychelles giant tortoises.

AB  - Giant tortoises (Geochelone gigantea) on Aldabra respond to light tactile stimulation of their soft posterior regions by adopting an immobile erect stance, previously thought to be a threat posture. It is argued that this is probably a cooperative posture assisting any potential symbiont to clean ectoparasites from the areas of soft skin thus exposed. Most Aldabran tortoises over 25 cm long respond in this way and the response appears to be unaffected by activity, sex, time of day and ectoparasite abundance. The visual stimulus of a white-throated rail Dryolimnas cuvieri within 1 m may also elicit this response, and rails were observed removing ectoparasites from tortoises which had adopted the cooperative posture. The distributions of the tortoise and the rail overlap only slightly and the mutualism is thought to be ecologically unimportant to both the ectoparasites and the rail. Comparisons are made with the mutualism involving Galapagos giant tortoises, Geochelone elephantopus, and the ground finches Geospiza fuliginosa and G. fortis, and the mockingbird, Nesomimus parvulus.

AB  - Human-animal interaction (HAI) can be valuable for captive animals, and many zoo-housed species benefit from interactions with their keepers. There is also an increasing body of evidence that some animal species possess personalities that are temporally consistent. However, the majority of zoo research, particularly on personality and HAI, traditionally has focused on mammals, and there are comparatively fewer studies on reptiles. Research was undertaken at the Faunistic Park Le Cornelle, Italy, to investigate the effects of approach tests and food interaction events on 5 male and 5 female Aldabra tortoise (<i>Aldrabrachelys gigantea</i>) behavior. During human-tortoise interactions, continuous focal sampling of behavior took place. The behavioral differences between individual tortoises, interaction type (approach or training) and person involved in the interaction (keeper, vet, or observer) were analysed using general linear mixed-effects models. The personality components of the tortoises were also quantified using principal component analysis. Overall, the study revealed that individuals acted significantly differently to one another, and that while females initially appeared to display a greater number of shy behaviors, this was not consistent across the group. PCA revealed two personality dimensions in the tortoises: boldness and avoidance. Overall, the study revealed that the tortoises possessed personalities that were independent of sex or scenario. The study also revealed that many tortoises chose to interact with their keepers during training and approach tests: this suggests that human-tortoise interactions may have some enrichment value. Future research could quantify tortoise personality in other scenarios such as in social interactions with other tortoises.

AB  - <AbstractText>The constant depletion of wild flora and fauna in India due to uncontrolled human activities, natural habitat destruction and covert poaching activities is threatening the ecological balance. The poaching and trafficking of wild species in the lure of money as well as fashion has wiped out a range of wildlife species that call for critical attention to tackle this menace. There are many transit routes through the states of Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Assam, which are major hubs for wildlife trafficking in India, in both domestic and international markets. The poaching of wild animals and plants slowly erases biodiversity, which in turn affects the survival of humans and other living species. Therefore, there is an urgent need to check ongoing wildlife crimes, raise the number of endangered species, rehabilitate exotic/extinct species and restore natural ecosystems. In this article, we collected wildlife crime data from web portals of various stakeholders, government agencies and authentic news sources, and discuss the current crime trends, challenges, and prevention approaches required to control and restore wildlife biodiversity in India.</AbstractText>

AB  - Cladistic analyses of 26 selected cranial characters of Geochelone did not support the implications of previous classifications. Most subgenera do not share derived features and, thus, are not considered monophyletic. The subgenus Manouria (G. emys and G. impressa), although not monophyletic, is the most primitive group of Geochelone, because its members lack most derived features. Indotestudo (G. elongata and G. travancorica) may be monophyletic; all members possess a ridge extending from the base of the inferior processes of the parietals anterolaterally over the dorsal surfaces of the pterygoids and palatines to the external pterygoid processes. Possession of a short trachea suggests that the subgenus Indotestudo should not be allocated to the genus Geoche- lone. Aldabrachelys is certainly monophyletic by virtue of a shared derived vertically elongated external narial opening. Other subgenera (Chelonoidis, Geochelone, Asterochelys) have no shared derived characters. Possible relationships between G. (Geochelone) pardalis and G. (Asterochelys) yniphora and G. (Geochelone) elegans, G. (Aldabrachelys) gigantea and G. (Asterochelys) radiata are suggested by cladistic analyses, but must await examination of additional anatomical systems, inclusion and analyses of other tortoise genera, and consideration of functional hypotheses. Until such analyses are completed, the subgenera of living Geochelone should be abandoned.

AB  - Today, the only surviving wild population of giant tortoises in the Indian Ocean occurs on the island of Aldabra. However, giant tortoises once inhabited islands throughout the western Indian Ocean. Madagascar, Africa, and India have all been suggested as possible sources of colonization for these islands. To address the origin of Indian Ocean tortoises (Dipsochelys, formerly Geochelone gigantea), we sequenced the 12S, 16S, and cyt b genes of the mitochondrial DNA. Our phylogenetic analysis shows Dipsochelys to be embedded within the Malagasy lineage, providing evidence that Indian Ocean giant tortoises are derived from a common Malagasy ancestor. This result points to Madagascar as the source of colonization for western Indian Ocean islands by giant tortoises. Tortoises are known to survive long oceanic voyages by floating with ocean currents, and thus, currents flowing northward towards the Aldabra archipelago from the east coast of Madagascar would have provided means for the colonization of western Indian Ocean islands. Additionally, we found an accelerated rate of sequence evolution in the two Malagasy Pyxis species examined. This finding supports previous theories that shorter generation time and smaller body size are related to an increase in mitochondrial DNA substitution rate in vertebrates.

AB  - Tropical island species and ecosystems are threatened worldwide as a result of increasing human pressure. Yet some of these islands also lend themselves to restoration, as they are physically defined units that can be given focused attention, as long as resources are available and clear conservation targets are set. Cousine Island, Seychelles, is a tropical island that has received such intensive restoration. From a highly degraded island in the 1960s, the island has now been restored to what is believed to be a semblance of the natural state. All alien vertebrates have been eradicated, as have 25 invasive alien plants. Cultivated plants are now confined to one small section of the island. Poaching of nesting marine turtles has been stopped, leading to an increase in turtle breeding numbers. The shearwater population has increased in size with poaching activities under control. The Sooty tern has also returned to the island to breed. The coastal plain has been restored with over 2,500 indigenous shrubs and trees, which have now grown into a forest carpet. There are strict quarantine procedures on the island, keeping it free of rats, mice, various alien invertebrates and potentially invasive alien plants. Three threatened Seychelles endemic land birds (Seychelles warbler, Seychelles magpie robin and Seychelles white-eye) have been introduced and are thriving, with these introductions contributing to both the magpie robin and the white-eye being downgraded from CR to EN (the warbler remains at VU). Ecotourism, and nature conservation for the local inhabitants, have been introduced in a way that does not reduce the improved compositional, structural and functional biodiversity of the island. The result of the restoration effort appears to be sustainable in the long term, although challenges still remain, especially with regards to adequate clean water and a non-polluting power supply on the island. Cousine is thus paving the way in the art and science of tropical island restoration as a legacy for future generations.

AB  - Managing giant tortoises can often be quite challenging due to their enormous size and their evasive and sometimes stubborn temperaments. Training can be an extremely useful tool when the need arises to shift an individual animal or an entire herd of tortoises to various locations in or out of their enclosures. Training can also be very advantageous when performing routine health screenings or treating animals in emergency situations. Without formal training these giant but gentle tortoises can become easily stressed, injured or often flee from staff when basic husbandry, medical or emergency procedures need to be performed. This paper details the development and implementation of training 2.2 Aldabra tortoises (Geochelone gigantea) at the Audubon Zoo. The benefits of target training and desensitizing Aldabra tortoises for voluntary blood collection and voluntary shifting them on- and off-exhibit heavily outweigh the alternative methods of manual restraint and physical coercion. Not only do the Aldabra tortoises benefit from the training, but Audubon Zoo’s veterinary and keeper staff now have a more efficient, less stressful way to impact the husbandry and medical aspects of these giant, gentle creatures.

AB  - Abstract An adult male Aldabra tortoise (Geochelone gigantea) presented with a deep flaking area of the carapace, and histologic examination of biopsies from this area revealed phaeohyphomycosis of the superficial keratinized layers. The disease progressed rapidly and spread to numerous sites on the carapace. After several weeks of regular debridement, deep bone involvement was evident and was confirmed through histologic examination. Fungal culture was attempted but was unsuccessful at isolating the infectious agent. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of extracted DNA from the fixed tissue block identified the fungus as Exophiala oligosperma. Initial treatment included weekly debridement and oral and topical antifungal agents. A nuclear scintigraphy bone scan was performed to determine the extent and status of the infection. Multiple foci of uptake of the radiopharmaceutical marker were present within the carapace, indicating active lesions. The tortoise was maintained on oral antifungal treatment, and l...

AB  - From this hilltop porch at sunrise, above the limestone landscape of Plaine Corail on the southwestern corner of Rodrigues Island in the middle of the Indian Ocean, I am looking out over a patchwork of small subsistence farms, awakening livestock, a sleepy airport, and a vast reef-bounded lagoon, bigger than the island itself – and something else. Something that warms the cockles of my heart. Something I have been writing and dreaming about for decades, a kind of project that gives me hope for conservation in an otherwise dark hour. Nestled in the midst of all these human landscapes is a truly prehistoric scene, the Francois Leguat Giant Tortoise and Cave Reserve. On this remarkable 19 hectares, Reserve Manager Aurele Anquetil Andre and his dedicated staff of young Rodriguans have planted over 130,000 native trees and shrubs, some virtually extinct in the wild and many quite rare otherwise, in just five years. Nearly all have survived, and with only limited maintenance despite the huge challenges posed by invasive weeds on all remote Indo - Pacific islands. Giant tortoises, over 1,000 of them, lumber about doing the work. Fenced in and well - fed on the invasive plants that compete with the natives, introduced Aldabra Tortoises ( Aldabrachelys gigantea ) weighing up to 200 kg crop the invasive plants, and smaller Radiated Tortoises of Madagascar ( Geochelone radiata ) pull up the weed seedlings. Remarkably – and I had to see this for myself – they don’t touch the native plants, which co - evolved with the extinct tortoise fauna (Cylindraspis spp.) that disappeared in the late eighteenth century after French colonists shipped over 280,000 of them to Reunion and other places for butchery. These plants have defenses against tortoises and browsing birds. Notable in the latter category was the extinct Solitaire ( Pezophaps solitaria ) a giant pigeon endemic to Rodrigues that was even larger than the Dodo, the famous extinct denizen of Mauritius, Rodrigues’ big neighbor 650 km to the west. Through heterophylly, the adaptation of having tough, finely dissected and presumably less edible leaves near the ground where animals can reach, as well as in some cases certain plant chemicals that the tortoises apparently don’t like, and long flexible stems that tortoises seem not to trample down or chew, these plants are thriving in the midst of a high density of these hungry lumbering reptiles. A tall secure fence keeps them inside the Reserve, and keeps out the free - ranging goats, sheep, and cattle which have converted so much of the rest of this island to Lantana and other unpalatable invasives. Those ungulates, with their advanced teeth, love to eat the native plants, and have nearly driven them to extinction. I have been an advocate for this approach – reintroducing the “megafauna” back to lands where they are extinct, or their closest living relatives or even an ecological surrogate – for several decades. The scientific underpinnings for restoring ecological functions this way are quite sound, and there are plenty of examples of this “rewilding” already working around the world, from Siberia’s “Pleistocene Park” with reintroduced musk oxen, wild horses, and so forth, to American media mogul Ted Turner’s vast ranches in the western US with herds of many thousands of bison, elk, and yes – even a giant tortoise (Bolson’s) reintroduced to its former range from Mexico. You can read about these and others in my recent book1. Some years ago I even proposed something like this for Madagascar – starting with tortoises but under the right circumstances perhaps including living ratite birds, hippos, and crocodiles, in some fenced reserve lands. I doubt that most readers took me seriously then (perhaps even now). Here at the Leguat Reserve, though, rewilding is not a hypothetical proposal, it is a way of life, a major tourist attraction, and a very interesting scientific experiment. Rewilding is working here, and working wonderfully. Tortoises pull the weeds, apply the fertilizer, and germinate the seeds. Regarding the latter, recently published experiments2 show that passing through the slow digestive system of a giant tortoise is just what some of these hard - to - germinate seeds of rare native plants have been waiting for. The authors show conclusively that the highly endangered, large - seeded native ebony tree (Diospyros egrettarum) is germinating and thriving on the remarkable 25-hectare Ile aux Aigrettes Reserve, a small island off Mahebourg, Mauritius, thanks to the Aldabra tortoises reintroduced there by the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation. At the Leguat Reserve on Rodrigues, guides lead thousands of visitors per year through huge spectacular limestone caves that have yielded the fossils of giant tortoises, Solitaires, and the other extinct biota of Rodrigues. Their tour, and the excellent museum on the Reserve, make that wonderful connection between the fossils of a remarkable extinct fauna, and the rare plants and surviving fauna of large handsome fruit bats, rare land snails, nesting White - tailed Tropicbirds, and the surviving cousins of the native giant tortoises now roaming the canyons and plateaus of the Reserve. What am I doing here? To begin with, my wife Lida Pigott Burney and I have in recent years started our own similar rewilding project on the island of Kaua`i, in the Hawaiian Islands. We likewise have a cave system, full of fossils of the extinct animals, as a centerpiece for restorations on worn - out farmland that feature thousands of native plants, some quite rare. Our big fossil herbivores, giant flightless ducks and geese, are all extinct, and alas, tortoises never reached Hawaii. So we laboriously pull the weeds, tons of them, with the help of the school children of Kaua`i and hundreds of volunteers. The current question I and my colleagues are asking is, could giant tortoises give us a hand, serving as ecological surrogates for the lost birds? In any case, the National Geographic Society funded our team, including paleontologists Julian Hume and Lorna Steel from UK, paleo - entomologist Nick Porch and speleologist Greg Middleton from Australia, and Lida and myself as the paleoecologists, to work on the excellent fossil deposits on Rodrigues and compare them to our results from elsewhere. That work is going well, we’re finding plenty. But thanks to these lumbering living reptiles, I’m thinking all over again about the potential to use tortoises, and perhaps substitutes for other extinct megafauna, to try some rewilding at an appropriate place – such as a securely fenced, private reserve in western Madagascar – and such a place exists. Owen Griffiths, the biologist/entrepreneur who created the La Vanille Crocodile Park and Tortoise Reserve on Mauritius (inspiration for Ile aux Aigrettes) and the Leguat Reserve on Rodrigues, is hard at work in Madagascar on his private reserve lands, where he hopes to start rewilding with Aldabra tortoises and other appropriate creatures. Before you dismiss this idea as crazy, you might consider that it was Charles Darwin himself who set all this in motion. He visited Mauritius on the return voyage of the H.M.S. Beagle in 1836, where he heard about the extinct giant tortoises of that island. Many years later, he suggested that the best way to see that the thousands of giant tortoises then living on uninhabited Aldabra Island (their last stand in the Indian Ocean region) didn’t go the way of the extinct giant tortoises of Madagascar, the Mascarenes, and the Seychelles, was to move some to these other islands and establish populations, and that was done on Mauritius. People took him seriously, and the tortoises’ future looks bright. Many of Darwin’s ideas were controversial then, and some still are in some quarters. Rewilding proposals like this are still being argued, but they have the potential to “jump start” evolution when it seems to have gone hopelessly off the track. After visiting the Leguat Reserve, I’m more hopeful than ever that evolution might have a second chance.

AB  - Although wild populations are now confined to Aldabra, giant tortoises were originally present on many other Indian Ocean islands. All belong to the genus Geochelone but are referable to two distinct subgenera, Cylindraspis in the Mascarene islands and Aldabrachelys on Madagascar, Aldabra, the Seychelles and neighbouring islands. These are distinguishable by skull and nasal structure, degree of shell ankylosis and structure of the plastron. Neither group has obvious close relatives in other areas. Mascarene tortoises, which are completely extinct, comprised several species: G. vosmaeri and the smaller G. peltastes on Rodrigues, G. inepta and G. triserrata on Mauritius, and what should probably be called G. indica on Reunion. All the tortoises of Aldabra, the Seychelles and neighbouring islands seem to be referable to one species, G. gigantea which appears to have shown some geographical variation. Madagascar probably had two species, G. grandidieri and another usually named G. abrupta which may well be conspecific with G. gigantea and was possibly the source of the Aldabra populations. Many of the distinctive features of Indian Ocean and Galapagos giant tortoises are interpretable as adaptations to the peculiar environment of ocean islands, particularly their lack of big predators and competing herbivores.

        <jats:p>The Aldabra giant tortoise ( Aldabrachelys gigantea ) is one of only two remaining giant tortoise species worldwide. Captive-bred A. gigantea are being used in rewilding projects in the Western Indian Ocean to functionally replace the extinct endemic giant tortoise species and restore degraded island ecosystems. Furthermore, large-scale translocations may become necessary as rising sea levels threaten the only wild population on the low-lying Aldabra Atoll. Critical management decisions would be greatly facilitated by insights on the genetic structure of breeding populations. We used a double-digest restriction-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq) approach to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) among the wild population and two additional captive populations of A. gigantea . A total of 149 unlinked, putatively neutral genome-wide SNPs were identified. The values of expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.32 to 0.5, whereas the minor allele frequency ranged from 0.20 to 0.5. These novel SNP markers will serve as useful tools for informing the conservation of A. gigantea .</jats:p>

AB  - The giant tortoises of Aldabra engage in feeding activity in the early morning and late afternoon, with variable periods of inactivity in the middle of the day. On clear days a high proportion of tortoises orient their long axes away from the sun. Sun orientation responses of 676 tortoises were measured in coastal mixed scrub and coastal grassland habitats in July 1978. These orientations showed that a significant number of tortoises faced away from the sun. The length and area of the shadow cast in front of the carapace was calculated for eight size classes of tortoise, assuming that the animal's long axis was in parallel with the sun rays. If a tortoise seeks shade when the shadow length has been reduced to less than 50% of the carapace height, we may predict that this would occur between 09h00 and 10h00. The shadow area at 09h00 and 10h00 was reduced respectively to 8.7 and 3.8% of that produced at 07h00. The shadow cast in front of the carapace allows a tortoise to feed in the shade, through which mea...

AB  - The skeletal development of captive bred Seychelles-Aldabra giant tortoises (Dipsochelys/Aldabrachelys) was studied from late embryos to adults based on 93 specimens (45 embyronic). The pattern of ossification is described and the developments of the characters used to distinguish different morphotypes are investigated. The timing of ossification of different bones in this genus is similar to the patterns reported for other taxa with complete chondrification of the skeleton immediately prior to the onset of ossification. By hatching the main bones of the skull, axial skeleton, limbs and plastron are at least partially ossified. In other turtle carapace, ossificiation has started by hatching but in Dipsochelys it does not commence until after hatching. Fusion of carpal and tarsal elements is also delayed. Morphotype differences are apparent in juvenile skeletons in the skull, carapace and fore-limbs. These can be traced to development of structures associated with specific jaw or limb muscles or the effects of muscle action. Three main processes were identified: the progressive development of muscle attachment sites, distortion of cartilage precursors of bones as a result of muscle action, differential growth rates of adjacent bones, differential ossification and differences in the exact form of cartilage bone precursors. These findings shed light on the morphological changes found in different tortoise morphotypes.

AB  - Species extinctions on islands are commonplace throughout history. Such extinctions can lead to dysfunctional ecosystems, especially when keystone species are lost. When the target species is extinct, an analogue species can be introduced to restore ecosystem function (known as ecological replacement).
In Mauritius, exotic giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) have been introduced to restore ecosystem function after the loss of their endemic counterparts, which were thought to be keystone grazers. Dietary analysis is essential to understand the impact that tortoises have on the ecological network. Metabarcoding of plant DNA from faecal samples is an invaluable tool to recover detailed dietary information. Such dietary analysis is often inhibited by the absence of comprehensive DNA barcode libraries.
The aim of this PhD research was to use DNA metabarcoding to assess the impacts and interactions of introduced Aldabra giant tortoises on Mauritian islands undergoing restoration. Here, the direct effect of tortoise dietary preferences on the plant community and the knock-on effects on two vertebrate species endemic to Mauritius, the Telfair’s skink (Leiolopisma telfairii) and Pink Pigeon (Nesoenas mayeri), were investigated.
A comprehensive DNA barcode library of the plants present on Ile aux Aigrettes and Round Island was created using the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) in order to maximize taxonomic discrimination at the species level in the dietary analyses. Ninety-nine percent of the Islands’ angiosperms were successfully sequenced. This is the first time island plant communities have been so comprehensively DNA barcoded in order to carry out dietary analyses and the library lays the foundations for the construction of more comprehensive food webs to further current understanding of ecological restoration.
Universal short-amplicon plant DNA metabarcoding primers for the ITS2 region, capable of amplifying the degraded plant DNA found in faecal samples were designed. To increase the breadth of the application of these primers, they were tested on both Mauritian and UK plant species to prove that they can be successfully applied in both tropical and temperate systems. In silico testing suggested that 88% of 1,111 UK and
9
Mauritian plants were a good match with the novel primers. In practice, 99% of 202 UK and Mauritian plants amplified successfully.
The diets of introduced Aldabra giant tortoises, Telfair’s skinks and Pink Pigeons were analysed by metabarcoding the plant DNA found in faecal samples, using novel primers. Giant tortoise grazing alters the plant community structure by cropping both exotic and native vegetation. This engineering of the vegetation structure indicates that tortoises create and maintain tortoise lawns in open areas, which together with the established forested areas constitutes a vegetation mosaic that may be beneficial for biodiversity. The giant tortoises also play a role in controlling the invasive weed species on Ile aux Aigrettes, by reducing plant biomass through grazing. However, Telfair’s skinks and Pink Pigeons exhibit dietary preferences for some exotic plant species. Thus, it is important to increase the availability and variation of native plant species that these endemic vertebrates prefer to consume in order to buffer the effect of reducing the availability of preferred exotic plants.

The species is endemic to Aldabra Atoll in Seychelles and is considered vulnerable due to its limited distribution and threats posed by climate change. Genomic resources for <jats:italic>A. gigantea</jats:italic> are lacking, hampering conservation efforts focused on both wild and ex-situ populations. A high-quality genome would also open avenues to investigate the genetic basis of the exceptionally long lifespan. Here, we produced the first chromosome-level <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> genome assembly of <jats:italic>A. gigantea</jats:italic> using PacBio High-Fidelity sequencing and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C). We produced a 2.37 Gbp assembly with a scaffold N50 of 148.6 Mbp and a resolution into 26 chromosomes. RNAseq-assisted gene model prediction identified 23,953 protein-coding genes and 1.1 Gbp of repetitive sequences. Synteny analyses among turtle genomes revealed high levels of chromosomal collinearity even among distantly related taxa. We also performed a low-coverage re-sequencing of 30 individuals from wild populations and two zoo individuals. Our genome-wide population structure analyses detected genetic population structure in the wild and identified the most likely origin of the zoo-housed individuals. The high-quality chromosome-level reference genome for <jats:italic>A. gigantea</jats:italic> is one of the most complete turtle genomes available. It is a powerful tool to assess the population structure in the wild population and reveal the geographic origins of ex-situ individuals relevant for genetic diversity management and rewilding efforts.</jats:p>

AB  - (Hansen & Galetti 2009), left a legacy of ecosystem dysfunction that threatens the remnant native biota. We and our colleagues in the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation have been studying the effects of taxon substitutes, the Aldabran giant tortoise (Aldabrachelys gigantea )a nd Madagascan radiated tortoise (Astrochelys radiata), on Round Island and Ile aux Aigrettes, two small Mauritian islands. Initial results from this experiment show that these alien tortoises are helping to control weeds that fruit prolifically and outcompete native plants. They also disperse large seeds of native trees, which hitherto rotted under maternal trees, limiting population recruitment and gene flow. Although longer-term monitoring is needed to establish the full impact of the taxon substitutes on these island food webs, preliminary results are encouraging. Should it prove that tortoises have a detrimental impact, they can be removed easily. Many of the arguments against rewilding do not apply to such projects. We believe it is important to undertake carefully controlled, hypothesis-driven experiments and that taxon substitution projects should be evaluated on a case-by-case and locality-by-locality basis, rather than being dismissed outright as having no conservation potential (Caro & Sherman 2009). It is unfortunate that the current focus of the headlinegrabbing and misused term rewilding is on the Pleistocene. Alternative management strategies are needed to preserve biodiversity. Where possible, refaunation with native species should be explored (Oliveira-Santos & Fernandez 2010), although refaunation itself is not riskfree and so should be undertaken under controlled conditions, especially where there has been a significant change in ecosystem structure following extirpation of the species being reintroduced. Altered ecosystem processesmayleadtounexpectedoutcomes.Simultaneously the use of taxon substitutes should be explored when native species are no longer available. Because rewilding has been used frequently and incorrectly as a synonym of reintroduction, future debates should avoid this ambiguous term and ignore Pleistocene extinctions. Terms such as taxon substitution, ecological analogues ,a nd proxy species more accurately describe a process that has the potential to make a significant contribution to minimizing the impacts of ecological perturbations that have occurred with increasing rapidity over the last few hundred years.

AB  - Tick species density and diversity on Aldabran tortoises was investigated in relation to the habitat range and size of each tortoise. Identification of tick infestation patterns forms an important aspect of effective tick control. Ten Aldabran tortoises were de-ticked and monitored over the course of 2 months. Tick species found were Amblyomma sparsum, Amblyomma nuttalli, Amblyomma hebraeum and Boophilus decoloratus, with the most prevalent species found being A. sparsum. Tick loads varied considerably from 20 to 214 ticks per tortoise, with most ticks collected from the head/neck region. Tortoises ranging outside Haller Park had higher tick loads (70‐214) compared with tortoises ranging within Haller Park (20‐99). Tick load was not correlated with tortoise size. Results indicate that tick loads are related to the habitat range of the tortoises and may indirectly also be related to food preference and host food availability. Implications of the findings and appropriate tick control measures are discussed.

AB  - Plants are sessile for the most of their life cycle, but their gametes (pollen) and their propagules (seeds) can move from short to quite long distances across the landscape. The mechanism for the latter is called seed dispersal. Seed dispersal is the link between the end of reproduction and the beginning of vegetative growth, and is an important function that determines plant population persistence by influencing reproduction, population- and community dynamics. Many plant species rely on animal-mediated seed dispersal (zoochory), which thus ultimately shapes much of the world’s biodiversity. Chelonians represent one of the oldest vertebrate lineages, and have been considered one of the early frugivores and seed dispersers in evolutionary time. However, the role of chelonians as seed dispersers has been largely neglected and underestimated until very recently, despite repeated calls for the study of chelonian frugivory and seed dispersal (FSD). In my thesis, I assessed the role of chelonians as seed dispersers, from species to communities. I began by performing a review and synthesis of chelonian FSD in Chapter 1, where I mainly focused on: i) the taxonomical and geographic distribution of chelonian FSD, ii) the taxonomical distribution and traits of plants dispersed by chelonians, and iii) chelonian seed dispersal efficiency. My work is the first to provide an overview of the role of chelonians as frugivores and seed dispersers, and it highlights their importance not only from the individual and population perspective, but also from the community perspective. In Chapter 2 I then focused on Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) to assess their role in the seed dispersal community of Aldabra Atoll in relation to other frugivores. I provide the third study to date that evaluates the role of chelonians as seed dispersers at the community level using network analyses, and also provide the first evaluation of the role of tortoises and other dispersers in the plant–frugivore community of Aldabra Atoll. To my knowledge, my study on the Aldabra seed dispersal network is the first of its kind performed in the Western Indian Ocean – a globally important biodiversity hotspot. Furthermore, because the plant–frugivore community of Aldabra is intact and representative of the preanthropogenic assemblages that other islands used to have, the Aldabra network can serve as a template for the conservation and restoration of plant–animal interactions in these islands. In Chapter 3, I experimentally examined whether tortoise size and/or seed size affect their gut retention times. Gut retention time is one of the main traits that structure the spatial extent to which seeds can be dispersed. My study is one of the few that simultaneously evaluates both the effect of tortoise size and seed size on seed gut retention time. I demonstrate that both small and large tortoises can retain seeds for long periods, and thus spread seeds far and wide, further supporting studies that have highlighted the capacity of giant tortoises for restoration. Finally, in Chapter 4 I studied the thermoregulatory ecology of Aldabra giant tortoises, including looking at how environmental temperature may affect their role as seed dispersers, and then applied the findings about their thermoregulatory ecology in the wild to the management and husbandry of captive tortoises in Chapter 5. My work is the first to assess the thermoregulatory environment and ecology of Aldabra giant tortoises across temperature gradients. I successfully applied the knowledge gained through the latter work to inform the evaluation and management of the thermoregulatory environment of tortoises in Zurich Zoo, and provide methodological procedures that can be applied to other captive ectothermic species to provide an adequate thermal environment.

AB  - We recorded the thermoregulatory patterns of five Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) (25-193 kg) during spring (ZRH spring trial), after the installation of a heating area (concrete heat pad and basking lamp) at Zurich Zoo, Switzerland. The measurements were compared to published results on the same tortoises observed prior to the installation of the heater (ZRH summer and winter trials), and on wild tortoises on Aldabra Atoll. The mean environmental temperature outside the heating area was 23.3 °C, significantly lower compared to Aldabra Atoll (30.3 °C; range: 23.8-43.8 °C), and to the environmental temperature range at which tortoises maximize their activity in the wild (Ta-opt ; 25.8-31.7 °C). The heating area exhibited a mean temperature of 36.3 °C, and tortoises that made use of the heating area were able to maintain a mean core body temperature (Tbc ) of 30.0 °C, which was comparable to the Tbc of tortoises during ZRH summer and on Aldabra trials, and an improvement over the mean Tbc recorded during the ZRH winter trial (21.2 °C). The smaller individuals reached the upper limits of Tbc recommended for the species, probably due to heating pad temperatures above Ta-opt . We discuss current practices to provide external heating sources for tortoises and how this method can be used to provide an adequate thermal environment for large captive reptiles. Finally, we provide recommendations for the installation of artificial heating sources for tortoises and large reptiles.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that restoration ecologists should be most concerned with restoring species interactions rather than species diversity per se [1]. Rewilding with taxon substitutes, the intentional introduction of exotic species to replace the ecosystem functions of recently extinct species, is one way to reverse ecosystem dysfunction following the loss of species interactions [2]. This is highly controversial [3], in part because of a lack of rigorous scientific studies [4]. Here we present the first empirical evidence of an in situ rewilding project undertaken as a hypothesis-driven ecosystem management option. On Ile aux Aigrettes, a 25-hectare island off Mauritius, the critically endangered large-fruited endemic ebony, Diospyros egrettarum (Ebenaceae), was seed-dispersal limited after the extinction of all native large-bodied frugivores, including giant tortoises. We introduced exotic Aldabra giant tortoises, Aldabrachelys gigantea, to disperse the ebony seeds. Not only did the tortoises ingest the large fruits and disperse substantial numbers of ebony seeds, but tortoise gut passage also improved seed germination, leading to the widespread, successful establishment of new ebony seedlings. Our results demonstrate that the introduction of these exotic frugivores is aiding the recovery of ebonies. We argue for more reversible rewilding experiments to investigate whether extinct species interactions can be restored.

AB  - Le Premier Congres pour la Protection de la Nature s'est tenu a Paris, en 1923, il y a 80 ans. Les amphibiens et les reptiles furent quasiment absents des exposes. Seules, les tortues marines et les tortues geantes des iles de l'ocean Indien firent l'objet de communications des participants a ce congres. Hormis les grandes especes tres spectaculaires, l'action de protection avait pour unique objet de s'interesser aux especes considerees comme utiles pour l'homme. Bien que le declin d'une partie des especes mentionnees en 1923 ait ete ralenti, grâce aux mesures de conservation (Testudo hermanni, Dipsochelys dussumieri), d'autres sont encore en danger, bien souvent en raison d'un manque de mesures de protection. Pendant toute la premiere moitie du XX c siecle, les amphibiens et les reptiles interessaient tres peu les acteurs de la protection de la nature.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">The Aldabra giant tortoise (Aldabrachelys gigantea) is one of only two giant tortoise species left in the world. The species is endemic to Aldabra Atoll in Seychelles and is listed as Vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List (v2.3) due to its limited distribution and threats posed by climate change. Genomic resources for A. gigantea are lacking, hampering conservation efforts for both wild and ex situpopulations. A high-quality genome would also open avenues to investigate the genetic basis of the species' exceptionally long life span.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="FINDINGS">We produced the first chromosome-level de novo genome assembly of A. gigantea using PacBio High-Fidelity sequencing and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture. We produced a 2.37-Gbp assembly with a scaffold N50 of 148.6 Mbp and a resolution into 26 chromosomes. RNA sequencing-assisted gene model prediction identified 23,953 protein-coding genes and 1.1 Gbp of repetitive sequences. Synteny analyses among turtle genomes revealed high levels of chromosomal collinearity even among distantly related taxa. To assess the utility of the high-quality assembly for species conservation, we performed a low-coverage resequencing of 30 individuals from wild populations and two zoo individuals. Our genome-wide population structure analyses detected genetic population structure in the wild and identified the most likely origin of the zoo-housed individuals. We further identified putatively deleterious mutations to be monitored.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS">We establish a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome for A. gigantea and one of the most complete turtle genomes available. We show that low-coverage whole-genome resequencing, for which alignment to the reference genome is a necessity, is a powerful tool to assess the population structure of the wild population and reveal the geographic origins of ex situ individuals relevant for genetic diversity management and rewilding efforts.</AbstractText>

AB  - The radiated tortoise and Aldabra giant tortoise were used as ecological replacements for the extinct Mauritian tortoise Cylindraspis inepta. Aldabra giant tortoises were better adapted as seed dispersers and grazers, and have become the species of choice. It is intended to remove the radiated tortoises from Round Island. It is suggested there was an open grazing climax plant community maintained by tortoises with heliophilous native plants that have adaptations to avoid being grazed or browsed and respond to grazing with prostrate growth form. The Aldabra giant tortoises fed on fallen fruits and spread the seeds of hardwood trees, screw-pines and palms in their droppings that subsequently demonstrated enhanced germination and growth rates. Preliminary work was done on Ile aux Aigrettes before the release on Round Island. The tortoises have established grazed areas colonised by the native tussock grass Chrysopogon argutus that the tortoises do not graze and is benefiting from reduced competition from the fast-growing non-native grasses.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>The use of ecological replacements (analogue species to replace extinct taxa) to restore ecosystem functioning is a promising conservation tool. However, this approach is controversial, in part due to a paucity of data on interactions between analogue species and established taxa in the ecosystem.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We conducted ecological surveys, comprehensively DNA barcoded an ecosystem's flora and inferred the diet of the introduced Aldabra giant tortoise, acting as an ecological replacement, to understand how it might have modified island plant communities on a Mauritian islet. Through further dietary analyses, we investigated consequential effects on the threatened endemic Telfair's skink.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Dietary overlap between tortoises and skinks was greater than expected by chance. However, there was a negative correlation between tortoise and skink preferences in herbivory and minimal overlap in the plants most frequently consumed by the reptiles.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Changes in the plant community associated with 7 years of tortoise grazing were characterised by a decrease in the percentage cover of native herbs and creepers, and an increase in the cover of an invasive herb when compared to areas without tortoises. However, tortoise dietary preferences themselves did not directly drive changes in the plant community.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Tortoises successfully dispersed the seeds of an endemic palm, which in time may increase the extent of unique palm‐rich habitat. We found no evidence that tortoises have increased the extent of plant species hypothesised to be part of a lost Mauritian tortoise grazed community.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p><jats:italic>Synthesis and applications</jats:italic>. Due to a negative correlation in tortoise and skink dietary preferences and minimal overlap in the most frequently consumed taxa, the presence of tortoises is unlikely to have detrimental impacts on Telfair's skinks. Tortoise presence is likely to be beneficial to skinks in the long term by increasing the extent of palm‐rich habitat. Although tortoises are likely to play a role in controlling invasive plants, they are not a panacea for this challenge. After 7 years, tortoises have not resurrected a lost tortoise grazed community that we hypothesise might have existed in limited areas on the islet, indicating that further interventions may be required to restore this plant community.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

AB  - The giant tortoise ( Geochelone gigantea (Schweigger)) population of Aldabra has varied greatly in numbers since the beginning of the present century. Recent estimates have shown that the population is composed of 150 466 ±s.e. 16 441 animals. Of this total, 60% are located in an area of 33.6 km 2 at the eastern end of Grande Terre. Animals composing the small population of 2000 tortoises on Malabar grow continuously, while those on Grande Terre only grow seasonally and are much smaller than their less numerous counterparts on Malabar. It is suggested that shade factors limit the time available for feeding in Grande Terre. Records of movement show that while some animals do move large distances 53% of the population are not relocated more than 500 m from their initial marking point. A mean annual rainfall of 941 mm would be expected to yield 1887 g m -2 a -1 (dry mass) of primary production, with a range of from 2337 to 4037 g m -2 a -1 . Tortoises of average mass (20-30 kg) consume 79 kg a -1 . Estimates of total consumption for areas with differing tortoise densities suggest that they would consume 11.3% at the eastern end of Grande Terre and 0.7% in the Pemphis scrub. Defecation records suggest that the gross assimilation efficiency of giant tortoises is about 50 %. The mean mass of tortoises on Aldabra are 21.7 kg on Grande Terre, 49.9 kg on Malabar and 51.3 kg on Picard. Standing crop biomasses derived from these weights are 35 387 kg km -2 on Grande Terre, 35 084 kg km -2 on Malabar and 25 342 kg km -2 on Picard. These biomass data are significantly higher than those achieved by large herbivores on mainland African wildlife ecosystems. By using data available on biomass mortality, P/B ratios (turnover times) of 0.042 for Grande Terre and 0.034 for Malabar are obtained. Annual production calculated from these ratios are 1486 kg km -2 a -1 for Grande Terre and 1193 kg km -2 a -1 for Malabar. The production efficiency of the giant tortoise population is about 2.1% which is in close agreement with figures obtained for other long-lived poikilotherms. Potential production for Grande Terre predicted from the mean rainfall only differs by 2.6% from that estimated. The eastern end of Grande Terre, however, exceeds this predicted figure by 61% and it is suggested that this is due to increased primary production induced by water available from the freshwater lens raised by spring tides. This phenomenon is similar to mainland African wildlife ecosystems fed by abundant ground water.

AB  - Insular communities are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic extinctions and introductions. Changes in composition of island frugivore communities may affect seed dispersal within the native plant community, risking ecological shifts and ultimately co-extinction cascades. Introduced species could potentially mitigate these risks by replacing ecological functions of extinct species, but conclusive evidence is lacking. Here, we investigate changes in plant-frugivore interactions involving frugivorous birds, mammals and reptiles in Mauritius, an oceanic island with an exceptionally well-specified frugivore community and well-described species introduction history. We demonstrate substantial losses of binary interaction partnerships (at the species level) resulting from native species extinctions, but also gains of equal numbers of novel interactions with introduced species, potentially supporting the idea that non-native species might compensate for lost seed dispersal. However, closer investigation of animal seed handling behaviour reveals that most interactions with seed dispersers are replaced by ecologically different interactions with seed predators. Therefore, restoration of seed dispersal functionality in this novel plant-frugivore community is unlikely.

AB  - <jats:p>Reptile behaviour and welfare are understudied in comparison with mammals. In this study, behavioural data on three species of tortoises were recorded before and after an environmental change which was anticipated to be positive in nature. The environmental changes differed for each population, but included a substantial increase in enclosure size, the addition of substrate material, and a change in handling procedure. A tortoise-specific ethogram was created to standardise data collection. Focal behaviour sampling was used to collect behavioural data. Changes in the duration of performance of co-occupant interaction and object interaction in the leopard (Stigmochelys pardalis) and Aldabra (Aldabrachelys gigantea) tortoises were observed following the environmental changes. The Shannon-Weiner&amp;rsquo;s diversity index did not yield a significant increase after the changes but had a numerical increase which was relatively greater for the leopard tortoise group, which had experienced the greatest environmental change. The leopard tortoises also demonstrated changes in a greater number of behaviours compared to the other species, and this was sustained over the study period. However, this included a behaviour indicative of negative affect; aggression. Whilst we are unable to conclude that welfare was improved by the management changes, there are suggestions that behavioural diversity increased, and some promotion of positive social behaviours occurred.</jats:p>

AB  - The Aldabra giant tortoise, Geochelone gigantea, inhabits the Aldabra atoll (off the coast of Kenya and north of Madagascar) and is now the only remaining species on the islands of the Indian Ocean. The giant tortoise population on Aldabra has been estimated at 150,000 individuals (Bourn and Coe, 1978). This colony is at present the largest population of giant tortoises in the world and remains a living reminder to mankind of how vulnerable nature can be to over-exploitation.

AB  - The Aldabra giant tortoise (Aldabrachelys gigantea) is one of only two remaining giant tortoise species worldwide. Captive-bred A. gigantea are being used in rewilding projects in the Western Indian Ocean to functionally replace the extinct endemic giant tortoise species and restore degraded island ecosystems. Furthermore, large-scale translocations may become necessary as rising sea levels threaten the only wild population on the low-lying Aldabra Atoll. Critical management decisions would be greatly facilitated by insights on the genetic structure of breeding populations. We used a double-digest restriction-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq) approach to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) among the wild population and two additional captive populations of A. gigantea. A total of 1674 unlinked, putatively neutral genome-wide SNPs were identified. The values of expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.33 to 0.5, whereas the minor allele frequency ranged from 0.20 to 0.5. These novel SNP markers will serve as useful tools for informing the conservation of A. gigantea.

AB  - The reproductive activities of one adult female Gal?pagos tortoise (Geochelone nigra) and three adult female Aldabra tortoises (Geochelone gigantea) were monitored over 2 yr using ultrasound scanning. A nonrestraining technique of tactile stimulation was used for all examinations. Developing, preovulatory, and atretic ovarian follicles, as well as eggs at various stages of shell deposition, were identified and measured. In G. nigra, follicles became preovulatory at a diameter of 40-42 mm and eggs were laid 34-84 days (mean = 55.6, n = 5) after the thin-shelled eggs were first detected in the oviducts. Geochelone nigra was capable of retaining eggs, with the shell already formed, until the next breeding season. No eggs have been produced by G. gigantea during their stay in Z?rich Zoo although follicles of 38-40 mm have been observed frequently in two animals.

AB  - Mating male Aldabra tortoises (Geochelone gigantea) emit loud, deep-pitched calls or "groans" while mounted. A bout of 34 groans was recorded and analyzed oscillographically and spectrographically. The sound energy occurs in periodic waves and there is no evidence of regularly pulsed energy. Calls are relatively stereotyped, with at least seven partial tones that range from 0.26 to 0.80 kHz. Only three tones occur throughout each call and in all calls, and these three have a harmonic relationship. More than half of the duration of the call, averaging 64 %, consists of a steady decrease in frequency, which occurs at the end. The beginnings of calls have the most energy, especially in the deepest tone, but there is considerable variation in the pattern of amplitude modulation. Call length and duration of the pauses between calls are relatively stereotyped, averaging 0.47 and 3.86 seconds, respectively. Movements made during "groan-thrusting" may be related to sound production, but the structures involved in the production, modulation, and resonance of the call are unknown. As the majority of the groan is apparently within the frequency range of highest auditory sensitivity for tortoises, there is an excellent chance that the sounds are perceived by the female, possibly intimidating her and facilitating mounting. Sounds are made by mating tortoises of a variety of species, and it would be interesting to know how these behaviors evolved.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Exotic species are often vilified as “bad” without consideration of the potential they have for contributing to ecological functions in degraded ecosystems. The red-eared slider turtle (RES) has been disparaged as one of the worst invasive species. Based on this review, we suggest that RES contribute some ecosystem functions in urban wetlands comparable to those provided by the native turtles they sometimes dominate or replace. While we do not advocate for releases outside their native range, or into natural environments, in this review, we examine the case for the RES to be considered potentially beneficial in heavily human-altered and degraded ecosystems where native turtles struggle or fail to persist. After reviewing the ecosystem functions RESs are known to provide, we conclude that in many modified environments the RES is a partial ecological analog to native turtles and removing them may obviate the ecological benefits they provide. We also suggest research avenues to better understand the role of RESs in heavily modified wetlands.</jats:p>

AB  - ORBITS OF BINARY STARS.—In addition to elements of O. ∑. 235, which apppear in the recently-published “Handbook of Double Stars,” Dr. Doberck has lately investigated orbits for the binaries 4 Aquarii and μ 2 Herculis, stars for which no similar computation had been previously made. He assigns a period of 129.8 years for the former, the passage of the periastre at 1881.80, and for the latter a period of 54.25 years, the periastre at 1877.13. The elements give the following angles and distances:—

AB  - The purpose of this application, under Article 75.8 of the Code, is to conserve the specific name Testudo gigantea Schweigger, 1812 in its customary usage for the giant land tortoise (family testudinidae) found on Aldabra Atoll in the western Indian Ocean. Taxonomic and nomenclatural confusion in the 19th and early 20th centuries led to competing and contradictory proposals between 1982 and 2006 to supplant T. gigantea Schweigger, 1812, first with T. elephantina Dumeril & Bibron, 1835 and then with T. dussumieri Gray, 1831. As a corollary, Aldabrachelys Loveridge & Williams, 1957, the genus-group name erected for the Aldabra tortoise, was supposedly reduced to a junior synonym of either the extinct Mascarene genus/subgenus Cylindraspis Fitzinger, 1835, or the South American genus/subgenus Chelonoidis Fitzinger, 1835, and replaced as the name of the Aldabra tortoise by the generic name Dipsochelys Bour, 1982. To stabilise the accustomed name of this species as Geochelone (Aldabrachelys) gigantea, a neotype of T. gigantea Schweigger, 1812 was designated in 2006. A subsequent claim of the rediscovery of the long-lost holotype now again threatens this usage and stable nomenclature by (1) rendering T. gigantea a junior subjective synonym of T. denticulata Linnaeus, 1766, (2) resurrecting the former nomen oblitum Testudo dussumieri Gray, 1831 for the Aldabra tortoise, and (3) setting aside the neotype of T. gigantea; this action also again threatens the established use of Aldabrachelys. The supposed holotype rediscovery is not unequivocally proven, and for the sake of nomenclatural universality and stability, it is proposed that the neotype designation of 2006 be affirmed and that T. dussumieri Gray, 1831 be suppressed.

AB  - The first objective of this study was to establish clinically relevant techniques for cardiac echocardiography in nonanesthetized Galapagos (<i>Chelonoidis nigra</i> complex) and Aldabra (<i>Aldabrachelys gigantea</i>) tortoises. A second objective was to establish guidelines for determining normal echocardiographic anatomy and function in both species. Select echocardiographic reference values were defined for 17 healthy Galapagos tortoises and 27 healthy Aldabra tortoises. Tortoises were either placed in ventral recumbency on an elevated surface or allowed to stand in a natural position by using food distraction. An ultrasound probe was applied in the left or right cervicobrachial window and was positioned in two long axis views to evaluate the three chambers of the heart and the associated great vessels, the presence of pericardial effusion, the atrioventricular inflow velocities, and pulmonic and aortic outflow velocities. The heart rate was 28 ± 12 (median ± SD) bpm, and the ejection fraction was 60.5 ± 10%. Thirty-four of 44 tortoises had identifiable physiologic pericardial effusion. All tortoises were successfully imaged using the techniques described, with consistent identification of cardiac structure and assessment of function. This study provides echocardiographic reference intervals for the clinical evaluation of suspected cardiac disease in captive-managed Galapagos and Aldabra tortoises.

AB  - LONDON. Physical Society, November 11.—Mr. Walter Baily, M.A., Vice-President, in the chair.—The discussion on Mr. Williams's paper, the dimensions of physical quantities, was resumed by Burton. He remarked that the idea that so-called “specific quantities,” such as specific gravity, are pure numbers was an erroneous one, and liable to lead to difficulties. The specific gravity of a substance was of the nature of density, and was a simple number on the convention that the density of water was taken as unity. If dimensions be given to specific quantities their interpretation would, he thought, be easy when rational dimensional formuæ were found. Referring to Fitzgerald's comments, he said, although the contention all energy is ultimately kinetic could not be gainsaid, the distinction commonly drawn between kinetic and potential energy involved nothing contrary to this view, and was useful convenient in many cases. As to the dimensions of s and k was inclined to favour Mr. Williams's views, for several considerations suggest that the two capacities of the medium are essentially different. Arguments to show that was probably absolutely constant in the ether, whilst Ze might be variable, brought forward. Of the two systems of dimensions for and k suggested by Mr. Williams, that which made r a density seemed preferable.—Prof. A. Lodge said he was greatly interested in propagating the idea that physical quantities are concrete, and therefore welcomed Mr. Williams's paper. He thought it desirable to keep some names for abstract numbers, “specific gravity” should be one. If another name involving dimensions was required “specific weight,”or "weight per unit volume,"might be used. Speaking of the dimensions of the various terms of an equation he did not think was usually recognized that in ordinary algebra or Cartesian geometry the principle of directed terms was rigidly adhered to, for if directed at all every term of such an equation directed along the same line. In this respect ordinary algebra was more rigid than vector algebra. Even if circular functions were involved, as in polar co-ordinates, they had the effect of making the directions of the terms the same. Other instances of problems bringing out the same fact were men- tioned. Mr. Boys thought Mr. Madden had been arguing in a circle when he spoke of the astronomical unit of mass, and deduced he dimensions of mass as L3/T2 from the equation MLT'2=M2/L2, for it was quite impossible that this equation could be true unless y, the gravitation constant, was intro- duced on the right-hand side. Mr. Williams's method was quite the reverse, for he maintained that unless k and i were introduced in the dimensions of electric and magnetic quantities, their dimensional formulte could not indicate the true - nature of those quantities, and hence were open to objection. Mr. W. Baily, whilst agreeing with Mr. Williams on most essential points, thought the total omission of L from dimensional formuize made the expressions more complicated and less symmetrical. For example, such expressions as XY/Z, X2 and xYz, which respectively represent undirected length, area, and volume, might with advantage be written L, L2, and L3 respectively. The restriction of the dimensions of r and k to those which give interpretable dimensional formulze for electrical and magnetic quantities seemed scarcely justified. Both the systems proposed could not be right, and he thought it would be more in accordance with our present want ofkrrowledge, if a quantity U of unknown dimensions were introduced such that r or k= U. density and k' or = U2. rigidity. This would keel) in view the fact that the absolute dimensions of quantities involving U were unknown. A list of the dimensions of the various quantities based on this arrangement was given. Mr. Swinburne, referring to the conventional nature of many units, said great differences exist between the ideas held by different persons about such units. Starting with the convention that unlike quantities could be multiplied together, he might have six amperes flow- ing in an electric circuit under a pressure of ten volts, and he might say he had sixty volt-amperes. The term "volt-ampere"could be regarded as indicating that the sixty was the numerical result of multiplying a number of volts by a number of amperes, or on the other hand it might be understood as a new unit, a wait, compounded of a volt and an ampere. Before Prof. Riicker's paper on suppressed dimensions was published, an electrician might have suggested measuring the length of a bench by sending an alternating current through it and deter- mining its self-induction, which he regarded as a length. Prof. Rbcker, however, would say that this could not give the right result, for s must be taken into account. He was inclined to think that dimensions were liable to mislead. Referring to scientific writers as authorities, he said Maxwell had been careless in some cases, for he had sometimes given dimensional formulre as zero, which really ought to have been L W T, or unity. In French text-books the errors had been corrected. Mr. Williams, in reply to Mr. Madden's remarks about self. induction being a length, pointed out that the subject might be looked at in two different ways, depending on whether one thinks of the standarciof self-induction as the practical standard of measurement, or the unit of self-induction as a physical quantity. In the former case the standard was a length, but in the latter the unit was a quantity of the same shecies as self-induction, the nature of which was as yet unknown. If its dynamical nature was known, then the absolute dimensions of all other magnetic and electric quantities would also be determined. In answer to Prof. Fitzgerald's remarks he said it was hardly likely that he should be unacquainted with the common view that kinetic and potential energies were ultimately quantities of the same kind, for it was a view with which he was quite familiar. The fact that they have the same dimensions was sufficient to show their identity, and the idea that all energy is ultimately kinetic was fundamental to his paper. This, however, did not imply that electrification and magnetization are of necessity the same, and the suggestion that they may be the same was only one of several "probable suggestions,"all of which were entitled to consideration. His chief reason for regarding Prof. Fitzgerald's suggestion as probably incorrect was that it led to a system of dimensional formulie incapable of rational mechanical interpretation, and containing fractional powers of the fundamental units. Prof. Fitzgerald's system would make resistance an abstract number, and.r and k directed quantities, whereas the former was a concrete quantity and the two latter must be scalar in isotropic media. If he (Mr. Williams) had erred in treating electrification and magnetization as different phenomena he could only plead that he had done nothing more than follow such authorities as Lord Kelvin, Dr. Lodge, and Mr. 0. Heaviside in the matter-The discus- sion on Mr. Sutherland's paper, on the laws of molecular force, was reopened by Prof. Perry reading a communication from the President, Prof. Fitzgerald. He objected to discontinuous theories, especially when Clausius had given a continuous formulae much more accurate over a very long range than Mr. Sutherland's discontinuous ones. The introduction of Brownian motions without carefully estimating the rates required and energy represented, and without giving any dynamical explanation of their existence, was not satisfactory. It would, he said, be most interesting if Mr. Sutherland would calculate the law of variation of temperature with height of a column of convectionless gas, under conduction alone (for Maxwell thought the inverse fifth power law ofmolecular attraction was the only one that gave uniformity of temperature under these conditions), and if necessary make tests with solid bars. Referring to the statement that molecular attraction at one cm. was comparable with gravitation at the same distance, he thought Mr. Boys would question this, and he suggested an exj5erimcnium crucis of the inverse fourth power law. Both the inverse fourth and inverse fifth power laws, assumed symmetry which did not exist. He also took exception to other parts of the paper. Dr. Glad- stone, referring to the relative dynic and refraction equivalents given in Table XXVIII. ofthepaper,said hethought it interesting to make a similar comparison between dynic and dispersion and magnetic rotation equivalents. The result as exhibited in a complete table showed a certain proportionality between the four columns but the differences were beyond the limits of experimental error. Mr. Sutherland, however, sometimes reckoned the dynic equivalent of hydrogen as o2I5, and at other times looked upon it as negligible. The analogies be- tween the optical equivalents did not depend on the propor. tionality of the numbers so much as upon the fact that the refraction, dispersion, and magnetic rotation equivalents of a compound was the sum of the corresponding equivalents of its constituent atoms, modified to some extent by the way in which they were combined. Whilst a somewhat similar relation held true for the dynic equivalents, the effect of "double-linking"of carbon atoms, so evident in the optical properties, was scarcely perceptible. The result of calculating the constants from Mi instead of from M2? was next discussed, the effect of which was to quite upset the proportionality before noticeable. Mr. S. H. Burbury said that on referring to the author's original paper, on which the present one was based, he found that a uniform distribution of molecules was assumed. On this supposition the demonstrations given were quite correct, and the potential was a maximum. If, however, the molecules were in motion the average potential must be less than the maximum, and the deductions in the present paper being based on wrong assumptions were liable to error. Prof. Ramsay remarked that many statements in the paper, on the subject of critical points, were very doubtful. Separate equations for the different states of matter were not satisfactory, neither was the artificial division of substance into five classes. The predicted differences in the critical points due to capillarity, had not been found to exist. Speaking of the virial equation, he said that hitherto R had been taken as constant. Considerations he had recently made led him to believe that R was not constant. The whole question should be reconsidered regarding R as a variable. Mr. Macfarlane Gray said he had been working at subjects similar to those dealt with in Mr. Sutherland's paper, but from an opposite point of view, no attraction being supposed to exist between molecules. In the theoretical treatment of steam he found that no arbitrary constants were required, for all could be determined thermo-dynamically. The calculated results were in perfect accord with M. Cailletet's exhaustive experiments except at very high pressures, and even here, the theoretical volume was the mean between those obtained experimentally by Cailletet and Battelli respectiyely. Prof. Herschel pointed out that Villar §eau had discussed the equation of the virial, where the chemical and mechanical energies were not supposed to balance each other. Mr. Sutherland's paper all turns on the existence of such a balance, and he (Prof. Herschel) could not understand why this balancing was necessary. The discussion was then closed, and the meeting adjourned.

AB  - Die vorliegende Arbeit fasst den aktuellen Kenntnisstand zu den Riesenschildkrotenarten G. gigantea und G. elephantopus unter besonderer Berucksichtigung der Fortpflanzungsbiologie zusammen. Dabei wird ein umfassender Uberblick uber die hierzu verfugbare Literatur gegeben. Im Rahmen einer zwischen Februar und August 2000 durchgefuhrten weltweiten Umfrage wurden daruber hinaus die aktuellen Haltungsbedingungen, die Futterung, das Management sowie der Reproduktionsstatus in 67 Haltungen von G. gigantea und 26 Haltungen G. elephantopus erfasst. Dabei wurde der Aktivitatsbeeinflussung durch das Management besondere Bedeutung beigemessen, da ein Zusammenhang zur Fortpflanzungsaktivitat vermutet wird und ein groser Unterschied zwischen der Aktivitat der Tiere im naturlichen Lebensraum und in menschlicher Obhut besteht. Halter gemischtgeschlechtiger Gruppen und Zuchter bewerteten auserdem die mogliche Relevanz fortpflanzungsbeeinflussender Faktoren. Anhand der Befragung wurde neben der Ermittlung des Status Prasens auch die praktische Umsetzung der aus der Lebensweise der Tiere im Freiland abgeleiteten Grundsatze bzw. der in der Literatur vorgegebenen Haltungsempfehlungen uberpruft. Zudem wurden potentielle fortpflanzungsspezifische Einflussfaktoren statistisch auf einen Zusammenhang zum Vorkommen von Eiablagen untersucht. Weiterhin wurden Ultraschall- und Spermienuntersuchungen der im Zoo Hannover gehaltenen G. gigantea durchgefuhrt. Bei der existierenden Literatur zu Haltung, Futterung und Fortpflanzung in menschlicher Obhut handelt es sich meist um Fallbeschreibungen und empirische Einschatzungen. Nur zu wenigen Teilaspekten liegen wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen vor. Kenntnisse der Umweltfaktoren, Ernahrung und Lebensweise sowie der damit verknupften physiologischen, okologischen und sozialen Zusammenhange bilden aber die Grundlage fur eine artgerechte Haltung und fur Zuchterfolge. Die Gesamtheit der Haltungen weist aufgrund der weltweiten Verteilung der Zoos und Privathalter sowie der unterschiedlichen lokalen Voraussetzungen ein sehr breit gefachertes Spektrum von Haltungsbedingungen sowie Futterung und Management auf. Innerhalb dieses Spektrums gelingen Zuchterfolge unter sehr variablen Bedingungen. Faktoren, die von vielen Haltern und Zuchtern beider Arten als besonders wichtig angesehen werden, sind: klimatische Faktoren (Licht, allgemeine Wetterverhaltnisse, Lufttemperatur), Gehegegrose und Komfort, Futterzusammensetzung, Gruppengrose, Geschlechtertrennung sowie Aktivitat und Fitness der Mannchen. Die Fortpflanzung von Riesenschildkroten stellt sich insgesamt als polyfaktoriell bestimmtes Geschehen dar. Statistisch belegt werden konnte ein signifikanter Zusammenhang zwischen der Durchfuhrung einer temporaren Geschlechtertrennung und dem Vorkommen von Eiablagen. Die im Zoo Hannover durchgefuhrten praktischen Untersuchungen an G. gigantea belegen eine Ovulationshemmung bei allen gehaltenen Weibchen und bestatigen damit fruhere Untersuchungen (Zurich 1995). Unter Einbeziehung des in der Befragung ermittelten weltweiten geringen Anteils von Weibchen mit Eiablagen mussen als Hauptursache ausbleibender Zuchterfolge nachteilige Umwelteinflusse auf die Ovulation angenommen werden. Im Vergleich zwischen Freilandbedingungen und heutigem Haltungsstandart ergeben sich in verschiedenen Bereichen Verbesserungsvorschlage. Diese betreffen insbesondere einen physiologischen Temperaturgradienten im Innengehege, eine ausreichende UV-Versorgung wahrend der Innenhaltung, eine Aktivitatsanregung der Tiere durch entsprechende Gehegegestaltung und einen variablen Futterungsmodus, eine artspezifische Futterung sowie ein an den durch Gruppengrose, Geschlechterverhaltnis und Haltungsdichte entstehenden sozialen Interaktionen orientiertes Management. Unter dem Gesichtspunkt der Fortpflanzung sind Aktivitatsanregung, Futterung und Management besonders zu beachten.
