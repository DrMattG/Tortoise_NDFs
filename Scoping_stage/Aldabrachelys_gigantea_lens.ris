AB  - The Anthropocene is tightly associated with a drastic loss of species worldwide and the disappearance of their key ecosystem functions. The orders Testudines (turtles and tortoises) and Crocodilia (crocodiles, alligators, and gharials) contain numerous threatened, long-lived species for which the functional diversity and potential erosion by anthropogenic impacts remains unknown. Here, we examine 259 (69%) of the existing 375 species of Testudines and Crocodilia, quantifying their life history strategies (i.e., trade-offs in survival, development, and reproduction) from open-access data on demography, ancestry, and threats. We find that the loss of functional diversity in simulated extinction scenarios of threatened species is greater than expected by chance. Moreover, the effects of unsustainable local consumption, diseases, and pollution are associated with life history strategies. In contrast, climate change, habitat disturbance, and global trade affect species independent of their life history strategy. Importantly, the loss of functional diversity for threatened species by habitat degradation is twice that for all other threats. Our findings highlight the importance of conservation programmes focused on preserving the functional diversity of life history strategies jointly with the phylogenetic representativity of these highly threatened groups.

AB  - Although some studies investigated lateralization in reptiles, little research has been done on chelonians, focusing only on few behaviours such as righting response and escape preference. The aim of this study was to investigate lateralization in Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea), focusing on asymmetrical positioning of the limbs and the head during resting behaviour, called sleep-like behaviour, involving both wild tortoises and individuals under human care. Subjects of the study were 67 adult Aldabra tortoises (54 free ranging on Curieuse, 13 under human care in Mahe Botanical Garden). For each tortoise observed during sleep-like behaviour, we recorded the position of the head (on the left, on the right or in line with the body midline) and we collected which forelimb and hindlimb were kept forward. Moreover, the number of subjects in which limbs were in a symmetrical position during the sleep-like behaviour was recorded. Based on our results, the number of tortoises with asymmetrical position of head and limb was higher (head: 63%; forelimbs: 88%; hindlimbs: 70%) than the number of tortoises with symmetrical position of the head and the limb. Regarding the head, throughout the subjects found with the asymmetrical position of the head during sleep-like behaviour, tortoises positioning the head on the right (42%) were more than those sleeping with the head on the left (21%). We found a relationship between the position of the forelimbs and hindlimbs during sleep-like behaviour. We reported no differences between Mahe (under human care) and Curieuse (wild) tortoises. Findings of this preliminary study underlined traces of group-level lateralization in head positioning during the sleep-like behaviour, possibly due to a left-eye/right-hemisphere involvement in anti-predatory responses and threatening stimuli as reported in reptiles and other vertebrates. This study aims at adding data on brain lateralization, often linked to lateralized behaviours, in reptiles, especially in chelonians.

AB  - <i>Aldabrachelys gigantea</i> (Aldabra giant tortoise) is one of only two giant tortoise species left in the world and survives as a single wild population of over 100,000 individuals on Aldabra Atoll, Seychelles. Despite this large current population size, the species faces an uncertain future because of its extremely restricted distribution range and high vulnerability to the projected consequences of climate change. Captive-bred <i>A</i>. <i>gigantea</i> are increasingly used in rewilding programs across the region, where they are introduced to replace extinct giant tortoises in an attempt to functionally resurrect degraded island ecosystems. However, there has been little consideration of the current levels of genetic variation and differentiation within and among the islands on Aldabra. As previous microsatellite studies were inconclusive, we combined low-coverage and double-digest restriction-associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing to analyze samples from 33 tortoises (11 from each main island). Using 5426 variant sites within the tortoise genome, we detected <i>patterns</i> of within-island population structure, but no differentiation between the islands. These unexpected results highlight the importance of using genome-wide genetic markers to capture higher-resolution genetic structure to inform future management plans, even in a seemingly panmictic population. We show that low-coverage ddRAD sequencing provides an affordable alternative approach to conservation genomic projects of non-model species with large genomes.

AB  - Abstract This study evaluates the potential impacts of the release of the giant tortoise, Dipsochelys arnoldi, to vacant habitat within the species' presumed historic range. Five individuals (3 males and 2 females) were released in December 2006 in the isolated Grande Barbe area of Silhouette Island, Seychelles. A comprehensive vegetation survey of all plant species within feeding height of the tortoises in Grande Barbe was conducted. These data, combined with daily feeding observations, were used to calculate feeding rates and diet preferences. Tortoises were observed to have a mean diurnal active time of 257 minutes per day exhibiting a mean feeding rate of 3.86 g of plant material consumed per minute of active time. Individuals were recorded feeding on 18 of 26 recorded plant species, 9 of which were selectively foraged. Species composition of plant species ingested differed between sexes. Males selectively foraged on 6 plant species and females selectively foraged on 7 species. Only 2 plant species we...

AB  - Background 
Ecological replacement involves the introduction of non-native species to habitats beyond their historical range, a factor identified as increasing the risk of failure for translocations. Yet the effectiveness and success of ecological replacement rely in part on the ability of translocatees to adapt, survive and potentially reproduce in a novel environment. We discuss the welfare aspects of translocating captive-reared non-native tortoises, Aldabrachelys gigantea and Astrochelys radiata, to two offshore Mauritian islands, and the costs and success of the projects to date.


Methodology/Principal Findings 
Because tortoises are long-lived, late-maturing reptiles, we assessed the progress of the translocation by monitoring the survival, health, growth, and breeding by the founders. Between 2000 and 2011, a total of 26 A. gigantea were introduced to Ile aux Aigrettes, and in 2007 twelve sexually immature A. gigantea and twelve male A. radiata were introduced to Round Island, Mauritius. Annual mortality rates were low, with most animals either maintaining or gaining weight. A minimum of 529 hatchlings were produced on Ile aux Aigrettes in 11 years; there was no potential for breeding on Round Island. Project costs were low. We attribute the success of these introductions to the tortoises’ generalist diet, habitat requirements, and innate behaviour.


Conclusions/Significance 
Feasibility analyses for ecological replacement and assisted colonisation projects should consider the candidate species’ welfare during translocation and in its recipient environment. Our study provides a useful model for how this should be done. In addition to serving as ecological replacements for extinct Mauritian tortoises, we found that releasing small numbers of captive-reared A. gigantea and A. radiata is cost-effective and successful in the short term. The ability to release small numbers of animals is a particularly important attribute for ecological replacement projects since it reduces the potential risk and controversy associated with introducing non-native species.

AB  - Geochelone pardalis (Bell 1828) shows wide variation of body size in
Africa, with tortoises in the north (Republic of Somaliland) being of comparable
size to insular giant tortoises. Growth data on G. pardalis, the continental giant
species G. sulcata (Miller 1779) and the Aldabran giant tortoise G. gigantea
(Schweigger 1812) were re-analysed using Ford-Walford plots, and their growth
patterns compared. All species and populations fitted a two-phase growth curve,
with initial asymptotic growth followed by slow indeterminate linear growth.
Asymptotic growth was non-Bertalanffy in all groups, with most individuals fitting
Gompertz or logistic-by-mass models best. Juvenile growth (for ages 3-8)
was also approximately linear in all groups. Variation between populations and
species was in the rate of juvenile growth, asymptotic size reached, rate of subsequent
linear growth, and survival rate of older individuals. Geochelone pardalis
from Somaliland had similar juvenile growth rates and asymptotic sizes to other
populations, and their large mean size was due to high survival and continued
linear growth after the asymptote. Geochelone sulcata had similar juvenile
growth rates to G. pardalis, but reached larger asymptotic sizes; indeterminate
linear growth was similar to that of G. pardalis. Geochelone gigantea had much
higher juvenile growth rates than the continental species, reflecting a longer
activity season. Asymptotic size and the rate of indeterminate linear growth were
lower in a high-density (Grande Terre) than low-density (Ile Malabar) population
of G. gigantea. The growth rate of juveniles was not affected by population density,
so that the Grande Terre population had higher growth rates of juveniles relative
to larger tortoises and was the only group to approach Bertalanffy-type
growth, as predicted.

AB  - Abstract Aldabra Atoll has the largest population of giant tortoises ( Aldabrachelys gigantea ) in the world. As such an important biological resource, it is necessary to understand how the effects of climate change will impact this keystone species; in particular the frequency of drought, which is likely to affect tortoise habitat. To assess whether drought frequency has changed over the last 50 years on Aldabra, we calculated the standardized precipitation index (SPI) to identify drought periods using monthly rainfall data collected during 1969–2013. We found that drought frequency has increased to more than six drought months per year today compared with about two months per year in the 1970s (t = 2.884, p = 0.006). We used MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy for vegetation activity, to determine how vegetation has responded to the changing drought frequency between 2000 and 2013. We found that Aldabra’s vegetation is highly responsive to changes in rainfall: anomalies in long-term mean monthly NDVI across Aldabra were found to decrease below the mean during most drought periods and increase above the mean during most non-drought periods. To investigate the response of tortoise habitat to rainfall, we extracted mean NDVI anomalies for three key habitat types. Open mixed scrub and grasslands, the preferred habitat of tortoises, showed the greatest decrease in vegetation activity during drought periods, and the greatest increase in average greenness during non-drought periods. Recent analysis has shown vegetation changes on Aldabra in recent decades. If these changes are caused by decreased precipitation, then the increased frequency of drought could impact the tortoise population, in both the short and long term, by limiting the quality and quantity of forage and/or shade availability within favoured habitats, and by changing the habitat composition across the atoll.

AB  - The giant tortoise of Aldabra, Geochelone gigantea, shows quite marked changes in proportions with age, although during growth the relations between the length of the carapace and various measurements of the plastron and scutes involve not only strong but also weak allometry. Certain scutes show a predisposition to split during growth. Accidental damage to the carapace is frequent. Males reach over 100 cm in carapace length but females are smaller, up to 80 cm. There is no segregation between the sexes in any single measurement investigated, except among the very largest animals. A general appraisal of carapace and tail shape is sufficient to sex only animals above 60 cm in carapace length. The number of annuli on each scute corresponds to the number of years of age at least up to the formation of the tenth to fifteenth annulus. A general assessment of the pattern of growth is made by plotting body measurements against number of annuli. Growth curves of individual tortoises are reconstructed by relating measurements of successively formed annuli to age. Growth rate is recorded by plotting the difference between successive pairs of annulus measurements against age. The growth rate of ageable tortoises varies between local populations on South Island and between populations of South and Middle Island. Growth rate declines with age, reaching asymptotes at mean values of between 20 and 30 years. Some individuals exhibit sudden increases in growth rate after several years of very slow growth. There is a well-marked daily cycle of activity, feeding being limited to the early morning and late evening. Agonistic behaviour is virtually absent. Breeding is seasonal and the males select partners from within a limited size range of tortoises. Most mating attempts are unsuccessful. On Aldabra, tortoises occur in a wide variety of habitats, in each of which they depend on a different plant species or vegetational association for food. On coastal plains the chief source of food is Sporobolus virginicus. A variety of small herbs is consumed on the barren stretches of coastal champignon. Distribution in these areas is profoundly affected by the availability of shade. Further inland, the tortoises browse heavily on Guettarda speciosa in woods dominated by this tree. They take advantage of seasonal successions in the vegetation associated with freshwater pools, feeding on each community as it develops. Most of the woody plants near the pools are ignored. On the platin, browsing is selective and the regeneration of some trees is held in check. A very important food source here is the 'tortoise turf' (a sward in which Panicum sp. is often dominant) developed under conditions of heavy grazing and susceptible to erosion by wind and the tortoises themselves. On Middle Island, where the population is small, the tortoises exert very little effect on the vegetation. Associations with other animals are mostly casual, but along the south coast dunes Coenobita rugosus is dependent on tortoise faeces for food. Fossilized tortoise bones have been discovered at many points on Aldabra, deposited in brown limestone. They probably date from before the interstadial of about 30 000 years ago. Some adult tortoises range over 7 km or more, across a variety of habitats, but many individuals appear to be sedentary. The population of South Island is enormous-of the order of 100 000 animals-with a density of about 30 hm $^{-2}$ on the platin. Higher densities are reached in Guettarda woodland. Local variation in numbers, size range and age structure depend on habitat preferences, differential movement of age classes and regional differences in growth rate. Attempts at assessing age class distribution are affected particularly by undersampling of the younger age classes, and the difficulty of counting the worn growth rings in animals with more than about 14. In the census sample, which may itself be an imperfect sample of the whole South Island population, at least 35% of the animals are below 20 years of age and only about 20% can have reached sexual maturity. More than 50 age classes may be present, but this and similar deductions are still speculative.

AB  - Insect populations were sampled at regular intervals, by using Health light traps, throughout a 12 month period at various localities about Aldabra Atoll. Abundance and fluctuations in numbers throughout the year of the predominant orders, families and species of insects are given for localities on West, South and Middle Islands, and Ile Michel. Differences between the composition, diversity and density of insect populations at selected localities are discussed in relation to ecological factors such as vegetation, rainfall and the presence or absence of higher animals, in particular giant tortoises, Geochelone gigantea, and/or colonial breeding birds.

AB  - Tortoises (Testudinidae) occur in a wide range of environments, providing important ecosystem functions, such as seed dispersal and refuge in the form of burrows. Tortoise movement has previously been shown to be related to resource availability, reproductive status and local environmental conditions. However, understanding of the variables that drive their movement remains comparatively low. We investigated aspects of movement in leopard tortoises Stigmochelys pardalis—the largest and most abundant tortoise species in sub-Saharan Africa—in response to environmental, climatic and individual variables in the semi-arid Karoo, South Africa. We used GPS telemetry to calculate bihourly and daily movement and used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to ascertain important predictor variables. Temperature, distance from water sources, and month were important variables for predicting both bihourly and daily movement. Our results showed that movement increased when individuals were close to known water sources, indicating that individuals close to water resources make regular long distance movements. Movement showed a positive relationship for temperature in both models, whilst rainfall was an important predictor for bihourly movement. Our results displayed aspects of seasonality, with movement highest in spring months, likely related to reproductive activities, although no sex differences were observed. We identified temporal and spatial conditions in which leopard tortoise movement increased. Our results further support the relationship between water as a resource and movement in leopard tortoises. Individuals used one of two basic movement behaviours in relation to water in this water scarce environment. Either an individual’s home range and movements included permanent water resources allowing internal water storage replenishment, or excluded these with reliance on food resources (such as grasses, forbs, and succulents) for water.

AB  - Understanding the extent of morphological variation in the wild population of Aldabra giant tortoises is important for conservation, as morphological variation in captive populations has been interpreted as evidence for lingering genes from extinct tortoise lineages. If true, this could impact reintroduction programmes in the region. The population of giant tortoises on Aldabra Atoll is subdivided and distributed around several islands. Although pronounced morphological variation was recorded in the late 1960s, it was thought to be a temporary phenomenon. Early researchers also raised concerns over the future of the population, which was perceived to have exceeded its carrying capacity. We analyzed monthly monitoring data from 12 transects spanning a recent 15-year period (1998-2012) during which animals from four subpopulations were counted, measured, and sexed. In addition, we analyzed survival data from individuals first tagged during the early 1970s. The population is stable with no sign of significant decline. Subpopulations differ in density, but these differences are mostly due to differences in the prevailing vegetation type. However, subpopulations differ greatly in both the size of animals and the degree of sexual dimorphism. Comparisons with historical data reveal that phenotypic differences among the subpopulations of tortoises on Aldabra have been apparent for the last 50 years with no sign of diminishing. We conclude that the giant tortoise population on Aldabra is subject to varying ecological selection pressures, giving rise to stable morphotypes in discrete subpopulations. We suggest therefore that (1) the presence of morphological differences among captive Aldabra tortoises does not alone provide convincing evidence of genes from other extinct species; and (2) Aldabra serves as an important example of how conservation and management in situ can add to the scientific value of populations and perhaps enable them to better adapt to future ecological pressures.

AB  - The reproductive ecology of the giant tortoise (Geochelone gigantea Schweigger) in three isolated populations was studied for 2 years on Aldabra Atoll. Density-dependent recruitment was demonstrated. Nest destruction in the low density area was dependent on the density of mature females providing a mechanism for regulating population size. Increases in annual rainfall and the resultant increase in food availability induced an increase in mean egg mass in the low density area (and thereby total hatchling production), whereas in the high density population mean clutch size, mean egg mass, total number of nests and total hatchling production all increased significantly. Large eggs produced large hatchlings which survived better during the first year than hatchlings from small eggs. Hatchling mortality was 94 and 81% in the first year in the high and low density populations respectively. Recruitment into the 5 year age class (after which predation is considered negligible) had almost ceased in the high density population compared with 0.44 per 100 breeding females per year in the low density population.

Rewildingwith taxon substitutes, the intentional introduction of exoticspecies to replace the ecosystem functions of recentlyextinct species, is one way to reverse ecosystem dysfunc-tion following the loss of species interactions [2]. This ishighly controversial [3], in part because of a lack of rigorousscientiﬁc studies [4]. Here we present the ﬁrst empiricalevidence of an in situ rewilding project undertaken asa hypothesis-driven ecosystem management option. OnIle aux Aigrettes, a 25-hectare island off Mauritius, the criti-cally endangered large-fruited endemic ebony, Diospyrosegrettarum (Ebenaceae), was seed-dispersal limited afterthe extinction of all native large-bodied frugivores, includ-ing giant tortoises. We introduced exotic Aldabra gianttortoises, Aldabrachelys gigantea, to disperse the ebonyseeds. Not only did the tortoises ingest the large fruits anddisperse substantial numbers of ebony seeds, but tortoisegut passage also improved seed germination, leading tothe widespread, successful establishment of new ebonyseedlings. Our results demonstrate that the introduction ofthese exotic frugivores is aiding the recovery of ebonies.We argue for more reversible rewilding experiments toinvestigate whether extinct species interactions can berestored.Results and DiscussionWe undertook this experiment on a small island because largevertebrates, and hence their species interactions, were lostrelatively recently [5], because the simplicity of island ecosys-temsfacilitatesassessmentsoftheimpactoftaxonsubstitutes[6], and because islands are potentially easier to restore thanmainland ecosystems [7]. We studied regeneration of theendemic slow-growing hardwood Diospyros egrettarum(Ebenaceae), which once covered the Mauritian island of Ileaux Aigrettes, because it is critically endangered followingintensiveloggingforﬁrewood.Todeterminetheextenttowhichthe ebony forest had been decimated, we surveyed and map-ped all ebony trees in an island-wide survey in 2007. Althoughwe located a total of 3518 adult trees, large tracts of the islandthat had previously been forested remained denuded, eventhough logging ended in the early 1980s (Figure 1).The Dispersal-Limited Ebony TreeDiospyros egrettarum produces large, pungent, oval fruits(mean size 6standard error: length 31.6 3.0 3 width 24.01.5 mm, weight 16.6 6 3.7 g) typically containing eight largeseeds (16.9 6 0.9 3 12.6 6 1.0 mm, 0.86 6 0.11 g) encasedin a sticky pulp and a hard, brittle exocarp. PreanthropogenicIle aux Aigrettes hosted populations of several endemicfrugivorous vertebrates large enough to swallow thesefruits and disperse the seeds; these included giant skinks(Leiolopisma mauritiana) and giant tortoises (Cylindraspisspecies)[8].Sincehumancolonization in thelate16thcentury,these large-bodied terrestrial frugivores have become extinct,leaving Ile aux Aigrettes with only small-bodied frugivoresunable to swallow and disperse the ebony seeds. As a conse-quence, D. egrettarum had become seed-dispersal limited;since conservation and restoration work began on the islandin 1986 [8], ebony seedlings have only been observed undermaternal trees.To determine whether there was a lack of abiotic dispersal,wequantiﬁedthedistributionoffallenfruitsfor18trees.Only7of 7437 fruits were found beyond the canopy, and these werewithin 1 m of the canopy edge. Indeed, for 15 of the 18 trees,all fruits were found directly under the canopy. This is notsurprising, because downhill movement cannot occur onthis ﬂat coralline island and so dispersal is entirely gravityderived. This is a direct parallel to the nondispersal of fruitsby neotropical megafauna following the Pleistocene mamma-lian extinctions [9].Can Taxon Substitutes Resurrect Extinct Interactions?Gianttortoiseswerechosenasourtargetfrugivorestoreplacelost seed-dispersal interactions for three reasons. First, theendemic Cylindraspis tortoises were among the last Mauritianmegafauna to go extinct; they persisted on several offshoreislands until the mid-19th century [8]. Hence, their interactionswith long-lived trees like ebony probably ended within thelifetime of many of the adult trees present today. Second,extant giant tortoises have broad diets and are thereforelikely to eat foods similar to those eaten by extinct tortoises[10]. Third, giant tortoises are low-risk substitutes thatare easy to employ and monitor in small-scale, reversiblerewildingprojects[10,11].WechosetheAldabragianttortoise(Aldabrachelys gigantea) as our taxon substitute because ofitsecologicalandtaxonomicalsimilaritiestotheextinctMauri-tian tortoises [11].Aldabrachelys gigantea as Taxon Substituteson Ile aux AigrettesThe ﬁrst four animals were introduced in 2000.

AB  - The main character used in identifying species of Chelonia is the carapace. The taxonomy of several terrestrial tortoise genera remains highly disputed, due in part to a limited knowledge of the lim- its of variation in many populations. For taxa where substantial captive populations are maintained and play an important role in conservation, there is a need to ensure correct identification. The use of the carapace in identification has sometimes been criticised due to potential problems of distortion caused by captive diets. I studied the effects of diet on two species; Testudo ibera and Dipsochelys dussumieri. I confirmed previous findings that low calcium - phosphorus ratios cause scute pyramiding and that extreme calcium deprivation results in metabolic bone disease. However, even though poor diets result in bone resorption, deposition at points of stress and abnormal fusion patterns, they do not comprimise the taxonomically useful characters of scute proportions, coloration and depressions and they have no impact on the plastron. Such carapace characters and those of the plastron in particular, remain of value in systematics. My study highlights the need for careful examination of the value of taxonomic charac- ters.

AB  - Aldabrachelys gigantea (Aldabra giant tortoise) is one of only two giant tortoise species left in the world and survives as a single wild population of over 100,000 individuals on Aldabra Atoll, Seychelles. Despite this large current population size, the species faces an uncertain future because of its extremely restricted distribution range and high vulnerability to the projected consequences of climate change. Captive-bred A. gigantea are increasingly used in rewilding programs across the region, where they are introduced to replace extinct giant tortoises in an attempt to functionally resurrect degraded island ecosystems. However, there has been little consideration of the current levels of genetic variation and differentiation within and among the islands on Aldabra. As previous microsatellite studies were inconclusive, we combined low-coverage and double digest restriction associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing to analyze samples from 33 tortoises (11 from each main island). Using 5,426 variant sites within the tortoise genome, we detected patterns of population structure within two of the three studied islands, but no differentiation between the islands. These unexpected results highlight the importance of using genome-wide genetic markers to capture higher-resolution genetic structure to inform future management plans, even in a seemingly panmictic population. We show that low-coverage ddRAD sequencing provides an affordable alternative approach to conservation genomic projects of non-model species with large genomes.

AB  - Summary Tortoises (land turtles) are familiar animals and are generally assumed to be strict herbivores. Their ecological roles are most obvious in giant tortoise species which, due to their size and local abundance, play major roles as keystone species and ecosystem engineers 1 , 2 , 3 . In the Galapagos and Seychelles islands these species are known to play major roles as the islands’ largest herbivores, with exceptionally high biomass and consuming up to 11% of primary production 1 . In addition they act as ecosystem engineers, dispersing seeds, breaking vegetation and eroding rocks 2 . However, as slow-moving poikilotherms most people assume their behaviour to be simple. Here we present video evidence of a Seychelles giant tortoise (Aldabrachelys gigantea) attacking a tern chick and pursuing it along a log. Finally the tortoise killed the chick and was observed to eat it. Other tortoises in the same area have been seen making similar attacks, although those were not fully documented. We believe that the exceptional combination of a tree-nesting tern colony with a resident giant tortoise population has created conditions leading to systematic hunting of birds by several individual tortoises; an entirely novel behavioural strategy for any tortoise species.

AB  - Small island states receive unprecedented amounts of the world’s plastic waste. In March 2019, we removed as much plastic litter as possible from Aldabra Atoll, a remote UNESCO World Heritage Site, and estimated the money and effort required to remove the remaining debris. We removed 25 tonnes at a cost of $224,537, which equates to around $10,000 per day of clean-up operations or $8,900 per tonne of litter. We estimate that 513 tonnes (95% CI 212–814) remains on Aldabra, the largest accumulation reported for any single island. We calculate that removing it will cost approximately $4.68 million and require 18,000 person-hours of labour. By weight, the composition is dominated by litter from the regional fishing industry (83%) and flip-flops from further afield (7%). Given the serious detrimental effects of plastic litter on marine ecosystems, we conclude that clean-up efforts are a vital management action for islands like Aldabra, despite the high financial cost and should be integrated alongside policies directed at ‘turning off the tap’. We recommend that international funding be made available for such efforts, especially considering the transboundary nature of both the marine plastic litter problem and the ecosystem services provided by biodiversity-rich islands.

AB  - Reptiles are animals than have been neglected in the research for all times. Some people have the opinion that these animals have fewer needs and demand less from their caretakers. The Aldabra Giant Tortoise lives on the Aldabra atoll outside the coast of Tanzania. The Aldabra tortoise population has varied throughout the years, but today the population is around 100.000 animals. 

The purpose of this study was to analyze the enclosure utilization of two Aldabra tortoises, a male and a female, at Parken Zoo in Eskilstuna, Sweden. The observations were carried out during a 10 days period, and gave a total of 28 hours of observation. The observation method was continuous registration and behavioral observations combined with timekeeping. The enclosure consisted of an indoor space that was divided into different zones and an ethogram was established. 

The results were unequal for the male and the female tortoises. The male preferred to be in the big and open areas of the enclosure. The female on the other hand preferred to stay in the feeding area and in the big area in the front of the enclosure. The female also favored the pool and the heating lights, which the male not equally interested in. The most frequently performed behavior was movement.

A contribution factor to the results may be the Aldabra giant tortoise thermoregulation behavior. Other factors that affect the result can be physiological differences between the two tortoises. It can be concluded that there is a need of more research about the Aldabra giant tortoise and also about other reptiles. This needs to be expanded so we can ensure excellent welfare for our zoo animals.

AB  - The results of a two year field study of the endemic giant tortoise population (Geochelone gigantea) on the western Indian Ocean atoll of Aldabra are described. The work entailed an extensive sample census from which the size of the population was estimated to be 150 000 individuals. A large scale marking programme was also carried out. 6882 tortoises (4.6% of the total population) have now been individually marked and measured. Tortoises are unevenly distributed over the atoll with local densities ranging from 0 to 217 per hectare. Various environmental factors are considered in relation to their distribution. A method of age estimation, based on growth ring counts, is described and the characteristics of populations in high and low density areas are compared. Analysis of preliminary recapture information shows that the majority of tortoises are relatively sedentary in their habits, although some are capable of long distance movements; and that individual growth rate is density dependent. The remains of 643 natural tortoise mortalities were examined. Life tables of survivorship and mortality were calculated for the tortoise population in the southeast of the atoll. Crude estimates of mortality and recruitment indicate that the tortoise population in that area is on the decline. Tortoise biomass estimates are far in excess of those for other natural tropical ecosystems with similar rainfall. The vegetation in the southeast is being greatly modified by tortoise activity and there is every indication that the tortoise population there exceeds 'the stable carrying capacity'.

AB  - Giant tortoises are among the longest-lived vertebrate animals and, as such, provide an excellent model to study traits like longevity and age-related diseases. However, genomic and molecular evolutionary information on giant tortoises is scarce. Here, we describe a global analysis of the genomes of Lonesome George-the iconic last member of Chelonoidis abingdonii-and the Aldabra giant tortoise (Aldabrachelys gigantea). Comparison of these genomes with those of related species, using both unsupervised and supervised analyses, led us to detect lineage-specific variants affecting DNA repair genes, inflammatory mediators and genes related to cancer development. Our study also hints at specific evolutionary strategies linked to increased lifespan, and expands our understanding of the genomic determinants of ageing. These new genome sequences also provide important resources to help the efforts for restoration of giant tortoise populations.

AB  - We studied the temperature relations of wild and zoo Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) focusing on (1) the relationship between environmental temperature and tortoise activity patterns (n = 8 wild individuals) and (2) on tortoise body temperature fluctuations, including how their core and external body temperatures vary in relation to different environmental temperature ranges (seasons; n = 4 wild and n = 5 zoo individuals). In addition, we surveyed the literature to review the effect of body mass on core body temperature range in relation to environmental temperature in the Testudinidae. Diurnal activity of tortoises was bimodally distributed and influenced by environmental temperature and season. The mean air temperature at which activity is maximized was 27.9°C, with a range of 25.8-31.7°C. Furthermore, air temperature explained changes in the core body temperature better than did mass, and only during the coldest trial, did tortoises with higher mass show more stable temperatures. Our results, together with the overall Testudinidae overview, suggest that, once variation in environmental temperature has been taken into account, there is little effect of mass on the temperature stability of tortoises. Moreover, the presence of thermal inertia in an individual tortoise depends on the environmental temperatures, and we found no evidence for inertial homeothermy. Finally, patterns of core and external body temperatures in comparison with environmental temperatures suggest that Aldabra giant tortoises act as mixed conformer-regulators. Our study provides a baseline to manage the thermal environment of wild and rewilded populations of an important island ecosystem engineer species in an era of climate change.

AB  - Evolution of population structure on islands is the result of physical processes linked to volcanism, orogenic events, changes in sea level, as well as habitat variation. We assessed patterns of genetic structure in the giant tortoise of the Aldabra atoll, where previous ecological studies suggested population subdivisions as a result of landscape discontinuity due to unsuitable habitat and island separation. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences and allelic variation at 8 microsatellite loci were conducted on tortoises sampled in 3 locations on the 2 major islands of Aldabra. We found no variation in mtDNA sequences. This pattern corroborated earlier work supporting the occurrence of a founding event during the last interglacial period and a further reduction in genetic variability during historical time. On the other hand, significant population structure recorded at nuclear loci suggested allopatric divergence possibly due to geographical barriers among islands and ecological partitions hindering tortoise movements within islands. This is the first attempt to study the population genetics of Aldabra tortoises, which are now at carrying capacity in an isolated terrestrial ecosystem where ecological factors appear to have a strong influence on population dynamics.

AB  - Research on the evolutionary and mechanistic aspects of aging and longevity has a reductionist nature, as the majority of knowledge originates from experiments on a relatively small number of systems and species. Good examples are the studies on the cellular, molecular, and genetic attributes of aging (senescence) that are primarily based on a narrow group of somatic cells, especially fibroblasts. Research on aging and/or longevity at the organismal level is dominated, in turn, by experiments on Drosophila melanogaster, worms (Caenorhabditis elegans), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and higher organisms such as mice and humans. Other systems of aging, though numerous, constitute the minority. In this review, we collected and discussed a plethora of up-to-date findings about studies of aging, longevity, and sometimes even immortality in several valuable but less frequently used systems, including bacteria (Caulobacter crescentus, Escherichia coli), invertebrates (Turritopsis dohrnii, Hydra sp., Arctica islandica), fishes (Nothobranchius sp., Greenland shark), reptiles (giant tortoise), mammals (blind mole rats, naked mole rats, bats, elephants, killer whale), and even 3D organoids, to prove that they offer biogerontologists as much as the more conventional tools. At the same time, the diversified knowledge gained owing to research on those species may help to reconsider aging from a broader perspective, which should translate into a better understanding of this tremendously complex and clearly system-specific phenomenon.

AB  - Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) are currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. However, negative impacts of sea-level rise are predicted to result in an overall population decline of 40-65 % over the next 100 years, rendering the species Endangered. Captive propagation is an important tool for in- and ex-situ species conservation, but breeding success outside the tortoises’ native island habitats has been very limited. Until now, the reproductive cycle of Aldabra tortoises has only been described in anatomic and behavioural studies. During a one-year period, plasma of four female and four male wild tortoises on Aldabra Atoll were examined monthly for levels of gonadal steroid hormones (oestradiol, testosterone, progesterone). Plasma oestradiol and testosterone values as well as meteorological data of the sampling period corresponded to previously published reports on seasonal changes in anatomy, behaviour and climate on the Aldabra Atoll. Seasonal changes in plasma testosterone were evident in males, with high values from January through April, reflecting previously described testicular growth and breeding season, followed by a nadir in August and September. In females, plasma oestradiol levels displayed seasonal changes, coinciding with reported ovarian growth from January to May. The obtained data provide prerequisite knowledge for endocrinological monitoring of reproductive processes and management of breeding programs, both ex-situ as in-situ, to establish reserve- and rewilded populations.

AB  - The labyrinth of the vertebrate inner ear is a sensory system that governs the perception of head rotations. Central hypotheses predict that labyrinth shape and size are related to ecological adaptations, but this is under debate and has rarely been tested outside of mammals. We analyze the evolution of labyrinth morphology and its ecological drivers in living and fossil turtles, an understudied group that underwent multiple locomotory transitions during 230 million years of evolution. We show that turtles have unexpectedly large labyrinths that evolved during the origin of aquatic habits. Turtle labyrinths are relatively larger than those of mammals, and comparable to many birds, undermining the hypothesis that labyrinth size correlates directly with agility across vertebrates. We also find that labyrinth shape variation does not correlate with ecology in turtles, undermining the widespread expectation that reptilian labyrinth shapes convey behavioral signal, and demonstrating the importance of understudied groups, like turtles.

AB  - The population sizes of most Seychelles reptiles was assessed through transects and focal counts for squamates and literature reviews for chelonians. Population density estimation tested several different sampling methods: transects, focal counts, leaf-litter quadrats and drift fences. Transects were suitable for estimating populations of skinks and snakes. Focal counts were more effective for geckos. Population assessments are made for all species except the cryptic Urocotyledon inexpectata. The data presented here allow the first attempt to assign IUCN Red List categories to all Seychelles reptiles; nine taxa are considered to be Vulnerable (Ailuronyx tachyscopaeus, Ailuronyx trachygaster, Dipsochelys dussumieri, Janetaescincus veseyfitzgeraldi, Phelsuma a. abbotti, P. abbotti sumptio, Phelsuma sundbergi ladiguensis, Trachylepis wrightii and Zonosauraus madagascarienis insularis), four Endangered (Chelonia mydas, J. braueri, Lamprophis geometricus and Lycognathophis seychellensis) and three Critically Endangered (Eretmochelys imbricata, Pelusios subniger parietalis and P. castanoides intergularis) The major threats to these species are intrinsically small ranges, habitat deterioration and, for some species,

AB  - Tortoises belong to the taxonomic family Testudinidae, which is considered one of the most imperiled families of the order Testudines. Anesthesia is often required for the medical and surgical management of large tortoises. The objectives of this retrospective study were to review drug regimens used to successfully anesthetize Galapagos (Chelonoidis nigra), Aldabra (Aldabrachelys gigantea) and African spurred (Centrochelys sulcata) tortoises, and to compare the times to effect and to extubation in tortoises administered different premedication protocols. Anesthetic records of giant tortoises admitted to the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine between January 2009 and December 2019 were reviewed. A total of 34 tortoises (six Aldabra, 23 Galapagos, and five African spurred) were included, resulting in 64 anesthetic events. Frequently used premedication protocols included an α2-adrenergic agonist and ketamine combined with either midazolam (group α2-adrenergic agonist, midazolam, ketamine, AMK; n = 34), a μ-opioid receptor agonist (group α2-adrenergic agonist, μ-opioid receptor agonist, ketamine, AOK; n = 13), or a μ-opioid receptor agonist and midazolam (group α2-adrenergic agonist, midazolam, μ-opioid receptor agonist, ketamine, AMOK; n = 10). Inhalant anesthetics (isoflurane, n = 21; sevoflurane, n = 23) were frequently used for maintenance of anesthesia following premedication. Out of the 34 total tortoises, 22 had only one anesthetic event, five had two anesthetic events, three had three anesthetic events, and four had four or more anesthetic events. Few adverse effects were observed and there was no mortality reported during the peri-anesthetic period. Sedation and general anesthesia of giant tortoises can be successfully performed with a combination of an α2-adrenergic agonist and ketamine in combination with midazolam and/or a μ-opioid receptor agonist.

AB  - <AbstractText>The constant depletion of wild flora and fauna in India due to uncontrolled human activities, natural habitat destruction and covert poaching activities is threatening the ecological balance. The poaching and trafficking of wild species in the lure of money as well as fashion has wiped out a range of wildlife species that call for critical attention to tackle this menace. There are many transit routes through the states of Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Assam, which are major hubs for wildlife trafficking in India, in both domestic and international markets. The poaching of wild animals and plants slowly erases biodiversity, which in turn affects the survival of humans and other living species. Therefore, there is an urgent need to check ongoing wildlife crimes, raise the number of endangered species, rehabilitate exotic/extinct species and restore natural ecosystems. In this article, we collected wildlife crime data from web portals of various stakeholders, government agencies and authentic news sources, and discuss the current crime trends, challenges, and prevention approaches required to control and restore wildlife biodiversity in India.</AbstractText>

AB  - Today, the only surviving wild population of giant tortoises in the Indian Ocean occurs on the island of Aldabra. However, giant tortoises once inhabited islands throughout the western Indian Ocean. Madagascar, Africa, and India have all been suggested as possible sources of colonization for these islands. To address the origin of Indian Ocean tortoises (Dipsochelys, formerly Geochelone gigantea), we sequenced the 12S, 16S, and cyt b genes of the mitochondrial DNA. Our phylogenetic analysis shows Dipsochelys to be embedded within the Malagasy lineage, providing evidence that Indian Ocean giant tortoises are derived from a common Malagasy ancestor. This result points to Madagascar as the source of colonization for western Indian Ocean islands by giant tortoises. Tortoises are known to survive long oceanic voyages by floating with ocean currents, and thus, currents flowing northward towards the Aldabra archipelago from the east coast of Madagascar would have provided means for the colonization of western Indian Ocean islands. Additionally, we found an accelerated rate of sequence evolution in the two Malagasy Pyxis species examined. This finding supports previous theories that shorter generation time and smaller body size are related to an increase in mitochondrial DNA substitution rate in vertebrates.

AB  - Tropical island species and ecosystems are threatened worldwide as a result of increasing human pressure. Yet some of these islands also lend themselves to restoration, as they are physically defined units that can be given focused attention, as long as resources are available and clear conservation targets are set. Cousine Island, Seychelles, is a tropical island that has received such intensive restoration. From a highly degraded island in the 1960s, the island has now been restored to what is believed to be a semblance of the natural state. All alien vertebrates have been eradicated, as have 25 invasive alien plants. Cultivated plants are now confined to one small section of the island. Poaching of nesting marine turtles has been stopped, leading to an increase in turtle breeding numbers. The shearwater population has increased in size with poaching activities under control. The Sooty tern has also returned to the island to breed. The coastal plain has been restored with over 2,500 indigenous shrubs and trees, which have now grown into a forest carpet. There are strict quarantine procedures on the island, keeping it free of rats, mice, various alien invertebrates and potentially invasive alien plants. Three threatened Seychelles endemic land birds (Seychelles warbler, Seychelles magpie robin and Seychelles white-eye) have been introduced and are thriving, with these introductions contributing to both the magpie robin and the white-eye being downgraded from CR to EN (the warbler remains at VU). Ecotourism, and nature conservation for the local inhabitants, have been introduced in a way that does not reduce the improved compositional, structural and functional biodiversity of the island. The result of the restoration effort appears to be sustainable in the long term, although challenges still remain, especially with regards to adequate clean water and a non-polluting power supply on the island. Cousine is thus paving the way in the art and science of tropical island restoration as a legacy for future generations.

AB  - From this hilltop porch at sunrise, above the limestone landscape of Plaine Corail on the southwestern corner of Rodrigues Island in the middle of the Indian Ocean, I am looking out over a patchwork of small subsistence farms, awakening livestock, a sleepy airport, and a vast reef-bounded lagoon, bigger than the island itself – and something else. Something that warms the cockles of my heart. Something I have been writing and dreaming about for decades, a kind of project that gives me hope for conservation in an otherwise dark hour. Nestled in the midst of all these human landscapes is a truly prehistoric scene, the Francois Leguat Giant Tortoise and Cave Reserve. On this remarkable 19 hectares, Reserve Manager Aurele Anquetil Andre and his dedicated staff of young Rodriguans have planted over 130,000 native trees and shrubs, some virtually extinct in the wild and many quite rare otherwise, in just five years. Nearly all have survived, and with only limited maintenance despite the huge challenges posed by invasive weeds on all remote Indo - Pacific islands. Giant tortoises, over 1,000 of them, lumber about doing the work. Fenced in and well - fed on the invasive plants that compete with the natives, introduced Aldabra Tortoises ( Aldabrachelys gigantea ) weighing up to 200 kg crop the invasive plants, and smaller Radiated Tortoises of Madagascar ( Geochelone radiata ) pull up the weed seedlings. Remarkably – and I had to see this for myself – they don’t touch the native plants, which co - evolved with the extinct tortoise fauna (Cylindraspis spp.) that disappeared in the late eighteenth century after French colonists shipped over 280,000 of them to Reunion and other places for butchery. These plants have defenses against tortoises and browsing birds. Notable in the latter category was the extinct Solitaire ( Pezophaps solitaria ) a giant pigeon endemic to Rodrigues that was even larger than the Dodo, the famous extinct denizen of Mauritius, Rodrigues’ big neighbor 650 km to the west. Through heterophylly, the adaptation of having tough, finely dissected and presumably less edible leaves near the ground where animals can reach, as well as in some cases certain plant chemicals that the tortoises apparently don’t like, and long flexible stems that tortoises seem not to trample down or chew, these plants are thriving in the midst of a high density of these hungry lumbering reptiles. A tall secure fence keeps them inside the Reserve, and keeps out the free - ranging goats, sheep, and cattle which have converted so much of the rest of this island to Lantana and other unpalatable invasives. Those ungulates, with their advanced teeth, love to eat the native plants, and have nearly driven them to extinction. I have been an advocate for this approach – reintroducing the “megafauna” back to lands where they are extinct, or their closest living relatives or even an ecological surrogate – for several decades. The scientific underpinnings for restoring ecological functions this way are quite sound, and there are plenty of examples of this “rewilding” already working around the world, from Siberia’s “Pleistocene Park” with reintroduced musk oxen, wild horses, and so forth, to American media mogul Ted Turner’s vast ranches in the western US with herds of many thousands of bison, elk, and yes – even a giant tortoise (Bolson’s) reintroduced to its former range from Mexico. You can read about these and others in my recent book1. Some years ago I even proposed something like this for Madagascar – starting with tortoises but under the right circumstances perhaps including living ratite birds, hippos, and crocodiles, in some fenced reserve lands. I doubt that most readers took me seriously then (perhaps even now). Here at the Leguat Reserve, though, rewilding is not a hypothetical proposal, it is a way of life, a major tourist attraction, and a very interesting scientific experiment. Rewilding is working here, and working wonderfully. Tortoises pull the weeds, apply the fertilizer, and germinate the seeds. Regarding the latter, recently published experiments2 show that passing through the slow digestive system of a giant tortoise is just what some of these hard - to - germinate seeds of rare native plants have been waiting for. The authors show conclusively that the highly endangered, large - seeded native ebony tree (Diospyros egrettarum) is germinating and thriving on the remarkable 25-hectare Ile aux Aigrettes Reserve, a small island off Mahebourg, Mauritius, thanks to the Aldabra tortoises reintroduced there by the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation. At the Leguat Reserve on Rodrigues, guides lead thousands of visitors per year through huge spectacular limestone caves that have yielded the fossils of giant tortoises, Solitaires, and the other extinct biota of Rodrigues. Their tour, and the excellent museum on the Reserve, make that wonderful connection between the fossils of a remarkable extinct fauna, and the rare plants and surviving fauna of large handsome fruit bats, rare land snails, nesting White - tailed Tropicbirds, and the surviving cousins of the native giant tortoises now roaming the canyons and plateaus of the Reserve. What am I doing here? To begin with, my wife Lida Pigott Burney and I have in recent years started our own similar rewilding project on the island of Kaua`i, in the Hawaiian Islands. We likewise have a cave system, full of fossils of the extinct animals, as a centerpiece for restorations on worn - out farmland that feature thousands of native plants, some quite rare. Our big fossil herbivores, giant flightless ducks and geese, are all extinct, and alas, tortoises never reached Hawaii. So we laboriously pull the weeds, tons of them, with the help of the school children of Kaua`i and hundreds of volunteers. The current question I and my colleagues are asking is, could giant tortoises give us a hand, serving as ecological surrogates for the lost birds? In any case, the National Geographic Society funded our team, including paleontologists Julian Hume and Lorna Steel from UK, paleo - entomologist Nick Porch and speleologist Greg Middleton from Australia, and Lida and myself as the paleoecologists, to work on the excellent fossil deposits on Rodrigues and compare them to our results from elsewhere. That work is going well, we’re finding plenty. But thanks to these lumbering living reptiles, I’m thinking all over again about the potential to use tortoises, and perhaps substitutes for other extinct megafauna, to try some rewilding at an appropriate place – such as a securely fenced, private reserve in western Madagascar – and such a place exists. Owen Griffiths, the biologist/entrepreneur who created the La Vanille Crocodile Park and Tortoise Reserve on Mauritius (inspiration for Ile aux Aigrettes) and the Leguat Reserve on Rodrigues, is hard at work in Madagascar on his private reserve lands, where he hopes to start rewilding with Aldabra tortoises and other appropriate creatures. Before you dismiss this idea as crazy, you might consider that it was Charles Darwin himself who set all this in motion. He visited Mauritius on the return voyage of the H.M.S. Beagle in 1836, where he heard about the extinct giant tortoises of that island. Many years later, he suggested that the best way to see that the thousands of giant tortoises then living on uninhabited Aldabra Island (their last stand in the Indian Ocean region) didn’t go the way of the extinct giant tortoises of Madagascar, the Mascarenes, and the Seychelles, was to move some to these other islands and establish populations, and that was done on Mauritius. People took him seriously, and the tortoises’ future looks bright. Many of Darwin’s ideas were controversial then, and some still are in some quarters. Rewilding proposals like this are still being argued, but they have the potential to “jump start” evolution when it seems to have gone hopelessly off the track. After visiting the Leguat Reserve, I’m more hopeful than ever that evolution might have a second chance.

AB  - Although wild populations are now confined to Aldabra, giant tortoises were originally present on many other Indian Ocean islands. All belong to the genus Geochelone but are referable to two distinct subgenera, Cylindraspis in the Mascarene islands and Aldabrachelys on Madagascar, Aldabra, the Seychelles and neighbouring islands. These are distinguishable by skull and nasal structure, degree of shell ankylosis and structure of the plastron. Neither group has obvious close relatives in other areas. Mascarene tortoises, which are completely extinct, comprised several species: G. vosmaeri and the smaller G. peltastes on Rodrigues, G. inepta and G. triserrata on Mauritius, and what should probably be called G. indica on Reunion. All the tortoises of Aldabra, the Seychelles and neighbouring islands seem to be referable to one species, G. gigantea which appears to have shown some geographical variation. Madagascar probably had two species, G. grandidieri and another usually named G. abrupta which may well be conspecific with G. gigantea and was possibly the source of the Aldabra populations. Many of the distinctive features of Indian Ocean and Galapagos giant tortoises are interpretable as adaptations to the peculiar environment of ocean islands, particularly their lack of big predators and competing herbivores.

        <jats:p>The Aldabra giant tortoise ( Aldabrachelys gigantea ) is one of only two remaining giant tortoise species worldwide. Captive-bred A. gigantea are being used in rewilding projects in the Western Indian Ocean to functionally replace the extinct endemic giant tortoise species and restore degraded island ecosystems. Furthermore, large-scale translocations may become necessary as rising sea levels threaten the only wild population on the low-lying Aldabra Atoll. Critical management decisions would be greatly facilitated by insights on the genetic structure of breeding populations. We used a double-digest restriction-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq) approach to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) among the wild population and two additional captive populations of A. gigantea . A total of 149 unlinked, putatively neutral genome-wide SNPs were identified. The values of expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.32 to 0.5, whereas the minor allele frequency ranged from 0.20 to 0.5. These novel SNP markers will serve as useful tools for informing the conservation of A. gigantea .</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The Aldabra giant tortoise (<jats:italic>Aldabrachelys gigantea</jats:italic>) is one of only two giant tortoise species left in the world. The species is endemic to Aldabra Atoll in Seychelles and is considered vulnerable due to its limited distribution and threats posed by climate change. Genomic resources for <jats:italic>A. gigantea</jats:italic> are lacking, hampering conservation efforts focused on both wild and ex-situ populations. A high-quality genome would also open avenues to investigate the genetic basis of the exceptionally long lifespan. Here, we produced the first chromosome-level <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> genome assembly of <jats:italic>A. gigantea</jats:italic> using PacBio High-Fidelity sequencing and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C). We produced a 2.37 Gbp assembly with a scaffold N50 of 148.6 Mbp and a resolution into 26 chromosomes. RNAseq-assisted gene model prediction identified 23,953 protein-coding genes and 1.1 Gbp of repetitive sequences. Synteny analyses among turtle genomes revealed high levels of chromosomal collinearity even among distantly related taxa. We also performed a low-coverage re-sequencing of 30 individuals from wild populations and two zoo individuals. Our genome-wide population structure analyses detected genetic population structure in the wild and identified the most likely origin of the zoo-housed individuals. The high-quality chromosome-level reference genome for <jats:italic>A. gigantea</jats:italic> is one of the most complete turtle genomes available. It is a powerful tool to assess the population structure in the wild population and reveal the geographic origins of ex-situ individuals relevant for genetic diversity management and rewilding efforts.</jats:p>

AB  - (Hansen & Galetti 2009), left a legacy of ecosystem dysfunction that threatens the remnant native biota. We and our colleagues in the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation have been studying the effects of taxon substitutes, the Aldabran giant tortoise (Aldabrachelys gigantea )a nd Madagascan radiated tortoise (Astrochelys radiata), on Round Island and Ile aux Aigrettes, two small Mauritian islands. Initial results from this experiment show that these alien tortoises are helping to control weeds that fruit prolifically and outcompete native plants. They also disperse large seeds of native trees, which hitherto rotted under maternal trees, limiting population recruitment and gene flow. Although longer-term monitoring is needed to establish the full impact of the taxon substitutes on these island food webs, preliminary results are encouraging. Should it prove that tortoises have a detrimental impact, they can be removed easily. Many of the arguments against rewilding do not apply to such projects. We believe it is important to undertake carefully controlled, hypothesis-driven experiments and that taxon substitution projects should be evaluated on a case-by-case and locality-by-locality basis, rather than being dismissed outright as having no conservation potential (Caro & Sherman 2009). It is unfortunate that the current focus of the headlinegrabbing and misused term rewilding is on the Pleistocene. Alternative management strategies are needed to preserve biodiversity. Where possible, refaunation with native species should be explored (Oliveira-Santos & Fernandez 2010), although refaunation itself is not riskfree and so should be undertaken under controlled conditions, especially where there has been a significant change in ecosystem structure following extirpation of the species being reintroduced. Altered ecosystem processesmayleadtounexpectedoutcomes.Simultaneously the use of taxon substitutes should be explored when native species are no longer available. Because rewilding has been used frequently and incorrectly as a synonym of reintroduction, future debates should avoid this ambiguous term and ignore Pleistocene extinctions. Terms such as taxon substitution, ecological analogues ,a nd proxy species more accurately describe a process that has the potential to make a significant contribution to minimizing the impacts of ecological perturbations that have occurred with increasing rapidity over the last few hundred years.

AB  - Plants are sessile for the most of their life cycle, but their gametes (pollen) and their propagules (seeds) can move from short to quite long distances across the landscape. The mechanism for the latter is called seed dispersal. Seed dispersal is the link between the end of reproduction and the beginning of vegetative growth, and is an important function that determines plant population persistence by influencing reproduction, population- and community dynamics. Many plant species rely on animal-mediated seed dispersal (zoochory), which thus ultimately shapes much of the world’s biodiversity. Chelonians represent one of the oldest vertebrate lineages, and have been considered one of the early frugivores and seed dispersers in evolutionary time. However, the role of chelonians as seed dispersers has been largely neglected and underestimated until very recently, despite repeated calls for the study of chelonian frugivory and seed dispersal (FSD). In my thesis, I assessed the role of chelonians as seed dispersers, from species to communities. I began by performing a review and synthesis of chelonian FSD in Chapter 1, where I mainly focused on: i) the taxonomical and geographic distribution of chelonian FSD, ii) the taxonomical distribution and traits of plants dispersed by chelonians, and iii) chelonian seed dispersal efficiency. My work is the first to provide an overview of the role of chelonians as frugivores and seed dispersers, and it highlights their importance not only from the individual and population perspective, but also from the community perspective. In Chapter 2 I then focused on Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) to assess their role in the seed dispersal community of Aldabra Atoll in relation to other frugivores. I provide the third study to date that evaluates the role of chelonians as seed dispersers at the community level using network analyses, and also provide the first evaluation of the role of tortoises and other dispersers in the plant–frugivore community of Aldabra Atoll. To my knowledge, my study on the Aldabra seed dispersal network is the first of its kind performed in the Western Indian Ocean – a globally important biodiversity hotspot. Furthermore, because the plant–frugivore community of Aldabra is intact and representative of the preanthropogenic assemblages that other islands used to have, the Aldabra network can serve as a template for the conservation and restoration of plant–animal interactions in these islands. In Chapter 3, I experimentally examined whether tortoise size and/or seed size affect their gut retention times. Gut retention time is one of the main traits that structure the spatial extent to which seeds can be dispersed. My study is one of the few that simultaneously evaluates both the effect of tortoise size and seed size on seed gut retention time. I demonstrate that both small and large tortoises can retain seeds for long periods, and thus spread seeds far and wide, further supporting studies that have highlighted the capacity of giant tortoises for restoration. Finally, in Chapter 4 I studied the thermoregulatory ecology of Aldabra giant tortoises, including looking at how environmental temperature may affect their role as seed dispersers, and then applied the findings about their thermoregulatory ecology in the wild to the management and husbandry of captive tortoises in Chapter 5. My work is the first to assess the thermoregulatory environment and ecology of Aldabra giant tortoises across temperature gradients. I successfully applied the knowledge gained through the latter work to inform the evaluation and management of the thermoregulatory environment of tortoises in Zurich Zoo, and provide methodological procedures that can be applied to other captive ectothermic species to provide an adequate thermal environment.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">The Aldabra giant tortoise (Aldabrachelys gigantea) is one of only two giant tortoise species left in the world. The species is endemic to Aldabra Atoll in Seychelles and is listed as Vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List (v2.3) due to its limited distribution and threats posed by climate change. Genomic resources for A. gigantea are lacking, hampering conservation efforts for both wild and ex situpopulations. A high-quality genome would also open avenues to investigate the genetic basis of the species' exceptionally long life span.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="FINDINGS">We produced the first chromosome-level de novo genome assembly of A. gigantea using PacBio High-Fidelity sequencing and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture. We produced a 2.37-Gbp assembly with a scaffold N50 of 148.6 Mbp and a resolution into 26 chromosomes. RNA sequencing-assisted gene model prediction identified 23,953 protein-coding genes and 1.1 Gbp of repetitive sequences. Synteny analyses among turtle genomes revealed high levels of chromosomal collinearity even among distantly related taxa. To assess the utility of the high-quality assembly for species conservation, we performed a low-coverage resequencing of 30 individuals from wild populations and two zoo individuals. Our genome-wide population structure analyses detected genetic population structure in the wild and identified the most likely origin of the zoo-housed individuals. We further identified putatively deleterious mutations to be monitored.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS">We establish a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome for A. gigantea and one of the most complete turtle genomes available. We show that low-coverage whole-genome resequencing, for which alignment to the reference genome is a necessity, is a powerful tool to assess the population structure of the wild population and reveal the geographic origins of ex situ individuals relevant for genetic diversity management and rewilding efforts.</AbstractText>

AB  - The giant tortoise ( Geochelone gigantea (Schweigger)) population of Aldabra has varied greatly in numbers since the beginning of the present century. Recent estimates have shown that the population is composed of 150 466 ±s.e. 16 441 animals. Of this total, 60% are located in an area of 33.6 km 2 at the eastern end of Grande Terre. Animals composing the small population of 2000 tortoises on Malabar grow continuously, while those on Grande Terre only grow seasonally and are much smaller than their less numerous counterparts on Malabar. It is suggested that shade factors limit the time available for feeding in Grande Terre. Records of movement show that while some animals do move large distances 53% of the population are not relocated more than 500 m from their initial marking point. A mean annual rainfall of 941 mm would be expected to yield 1887 g m -2 a -1 (dry mass) of primary production, with a range of from 2337 to 4037 g m -2 a -1 . Tortoises of average mass (20-30 kg) consume 79 kg a -1 . Estimates of total consumption for areas with differing tortoise densities suggest that they would consume 11.3% at the eastern end of Grande Terre and 0.7% in the Pemphis scrub. Defecation records suggest that the gross assimilation efficiency of giant tortoises is about 50 %. The mean mass of tortoises on Aldabra are 21.7 kg on Grande Terre, 49.9 kg on Malabar and 51.3 kg on Picard. Standing crop biomasses derived from these weights are 35 387 kg km -2 on Grande Terre, 35 084 kg km -2 on Malabar and 25 342 kg km -2 on Picard. These biomass data are significantly higher than those achieved by large herbivores on mainland African wildlife ecosystems. By using data available on biomass mortality, P/B ratios (turnover times) of 0.042 for Grande Terre and 0.034 for Malabar are obtained. Annual production calculated from these ratios are 1486 kg km -2 a -1 for Grande Terre and 1193 kg km -2 a -1 for Malabar. The production efficiency of the giant tortoise population is about 2.1% which is in close agreement with figures obtained for other long-lived poikilotherms. Potential production for Grande Terre predicted from the mean rainfall only differs by 2.6% from that estimated. The eastern end of Grande Terre, however, exceeds this predicted figure by 61% and it is suggested that this is due to increased primary production induced by water available from the freshwater lens raised by spring tides. This phenomenon is similar to mainland African wildlife ecosystems fed by abundant ground water.

AB  - Insular communities are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic extinctions and introductions. Changes in composition of island frugivore communities may affect seed dispersal within the native plant community, risking ecological shifts and ultimately co-extinction cascades. Introduced species could potentially mitigate these risks by replacing ecological functions of extinct species, but conclusive evidence is lacking. Here, we investigate changes in plant-frugivore interactions involving frugivorous birds, mammals and reptiles in Mauritius, an oceanic island with an exceptionally well-specified frugivore community and well-described species introduction history. We demonstrate substantial losses of binary interaction partnerships (at the species level) resulting from native species extinctions, but also gains of equal numbers of novel interactions with introduced species, potentially supporting the idea that non-native species might compensate for lost seed dispersal. However, closer investigation of animal seed handling behaviour reveals that most interactions with seed dispersers are replaced by ecologically different interactions with seed predators. Therefore, restoration of seed dispersal functionality in this novel plant-frugivore community is unlikely.

AB  - <jats:p>Reptile behaviour and welfare are understudied in comparison with mammals. In this study, behavioural data on three species of tortoises were recorded before and after an environmental change which was anticipated to be positive in nature. The environmental changes differed for each population, but included a substantial increase in enclosure size, the addition of substrate material, and a change in handling procedure. A tortoise-specific ethogram was created to standardise data collection. Focal behaviour sampling was used to collect behavioural data. Changes in the duration of performance of co-occupant interaction and object interaction in the leopard (Stigmochelys pardalis) and Aldabra (Aldabrachelys gigantea) tortoises were observed following the environmental changes. The Shannon-Weiner&amp;rsquo;s diversity index did not yield a significant increase after the changes but had a numerical increase which was relatively greater for the leopard tortoise group, which had experienced the greatest environmental change. The leopard tortoises also demonstrated changes in a greater number of behaviours compared to the other species, and this was sustained over the study period. However, this included a behaviour indicative of negative affect; aggression. Whilst we are unable to conclude that welfare was improved by the management changes, there are suggestions that behavioural diversity increased, and some promotion of positive social behaviours occurred.</jats:p>

AB  - The Aldabra giant tortoise, Geochelone gigantea, inhabits the Aldabra atoll (off the coast of Kenya and north of Madagascar) and is now the only remaining species on the islands of the Indian Ocean. The giant tortoise population on Aldabra has been estimated at 150,000 individuals (Bourn and Coe, 1978). This colony is at present the largest population of giant tortoises in the world and remains a living reminder to mankind of how vulnerable nature can be to over-exploitation.

AB  - The Aldabra giant tortoise (Aldabrachelys gigantea) is one of only two remaining giant tortoise species worldwide. Captive-bred A. gigantea are being used in rewilding projects in the Western Indian Ocean to functionally replace the extinct endemic giant tortoise species and restore degraded island ecosystems. Furthermore, large-scale translocations may become necessary as rising sea levels threaten the only wild population on the low-lying Aldabra Atoll. Critical management decisions would be greatly facilitated by insights on the genetic structure of breeding populations. We used a double-digest restriction-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq) approach to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) among the wild population and two additional captive populations of A. gigantea. A total of 1674 unlinked, putatively neutral genome-wide SNPs were identified. The values of expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.33 to 0.5, whereas the minor allele frequency ranged from 0.20 to 0.5. These novel SNP markers will serve as useful tools for informing the conservation of A. gigantea.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Exotic species are often vilified as “bad” without consideration of the potential they have for contributing to ecological functions in degraded ecosystems. The red-eared slider turtle (RES) has been disparaged as one of the worst invasive species. Based on this review, we suggest that RES contribute some ecosystem functions in urban wetlands comparable to those provided by the native turtles they sometimes dominate or replace. While we do not advocate for releases outside their native range, or into natural environments, in this review, we examine the case for the RES to be considered potentially beneficial in heavily human-altered and degraded ecosystems where native turtles struggle or fail to persist. After reviewing the ecosystem functions RESs are known to provide, we conclude that in many modified environments the RES is a partial ecological analog to native turtles and removing them may obviate the ecological benefits they provide. We also suggest research avenues to better understand the role of RESs in heavily modified wetlands.</jats:p>

AB  - The first objective of this study was to establish clinically relevant techniques for cardiac echocardiography in nonanesthetized Galapagos (<i>Chelonoidis nigra</i> complex) and Aldabra (<i>Aldabrachelys gigantea</i>) tortoises. A second objective was to establish guidelines for determining normal echocardiographic anatomy and function in both species. Select echocardiographic reference values were defined for 17 healthy Galapagos tortoises and 27 healthy Aldabra tortoises. Tortoises were either placed in ventral recumbency on an elevated surface or allowed to stand in a natural position by using food distraction. An ultrasound probe was applied in the left or right cervicobrachial window and was positioned in two long axis views to evaluate the three chambers of the heart and the associated great vessels, the presence of pericardial effusion, the atrioventricular inflow velocities, and pulmonic and aortic outflow velocities. The heart rate was 28 ± 12 (median ± SD) bpm, and the ejection fraction was 60.5 ± 10%. Thirty-four of 44 tortoises had identifiable physiologic pericardial effusion. All tortoises were successfully imaged using the techniques described, with consistent identification of cardiac structure and assessment of function. This study provides echocardiographic reference intervals for the clinical evaluation of suspected cardiac disease in captive-managed Galapagos and Aldabra tortoises.
