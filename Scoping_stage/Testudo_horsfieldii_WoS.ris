Population density varied between 0.7 and 2.15 ind./ha. An historical analysis of the habitat formation and divergence of the Horsfield tortoise on the Iranian Plateau is given. Information on morphology, ecology and parasitology of the populations from the environs of Mazdavand is presented. The morphometric characteristics of two populations were compared and some morphometric indices were found. The possible co-occurrence of Agrionemys horsfieldii and Testudo graeca zarudnyi is discussed. These two species show a preference for different conditions and rarely meet together in the same habitat.

AB  - Four species of Protozoa, 17 species of helminths and 6 species of ticks parasitize on the Central Asian tortoise, Agrionemys horsfieldii Gray 1844. Parasitic Protozoa are mainly referred to Sporozoa. Helminths are represented by Nematoda and belong to the orders Oxyurida, Ascaridida, and Spirurida. Most of the nematode species belong to Oxyuridea and Pharyngodonidae. The greatest species diversity of Pharyngodonidae falls on 2 specific Testudinidae genus: Tachygonetria and Mehdiella. Hyalomma aegyptium predominates among ixodid ticks. All ontogenic phases parasitize on Central Asian tortoise, mainly at the stage of imago. The extensiveness of H. aegyptium infection in turtles varies greatly (from 0 to 79%). Four other Ixodidae species parasitize on turtle at the phase of larvae and nymphs. Haemaphysalis sulcata is the first among them by the frequency of occurrence. Among argasids, only Ornithodoros tartakovskyi parasitizes on A. horsfieldii. The pattern of spreading of all the ticks in the tortoise populations is local. Tortoises are most frequently infected with ticks at the foothills. Several tick species can parasitize simultaneously on the same individual. The activity of parasites synchronously coincides with the seasonal activity of A. horsfieldi. The maximum number of parasites falls on late spring and early summer. After hibernation, the infestation of tortoises with parasites is minimal

AB  - The sensory corpuscles of Testudo horsfieldii in the skin of the upper lip and face were studied with light and electron microscopy. The sensory corpuscles were situated under epidermis; in the corium and also between the upper jaw bone tissues in the rostral part of oral cavity. The skin sensory corpuscles with a ramified inner core were grouped in clusters. Within the corpuscle there were several simple inner cores embedded within a common superficial capsule. The complex corpuscles have a novel structure in comparison to what has been described for sensory nerve endings in turtle. The complex sensory corpuscles probably function as mechanoreceptors important for monitoring the movement of the keratinized ridges and the most rostral part of the upper jaw, the rhamphotheci.

AB  - The available data on feeding of Agrionemys horsfieldiiin in nature are summarized. The diet of tortoise consists of 167 plant species of 42 families. The main share is ephemeral plants of the Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Liliaceae, Papaveraceae, Fabaceae, Poaceae families. Food resources of tortoise in different landscapes, the competition between tortoises and herbivorous animals, consumption of small animals and toxic plants are considered. Agrionemys horsfieldii is closer to specialized herbivores due to their selectivity of plants for food. The stable existence of the population has been provided by the group of basic food objects that includes preferred and abundant plant species. The food competition between the tortoise and cattle is possible only in spring and in the areas with high density of the tortoise population. There is no competition with wild hoofed because of their low population. Presently, the damage for plant-growing from Agrionemys horsfieldii has decreased due to displacement of tortoises from irrigated land and considerable reduction of their number in the areas of the dry-farming fields.

AB  - Based on intraspecific polymorphism of 12S rRNA gene, genetic variation of isolated populations of the Central Asian tortoise, Agrionemys horsfieldii, was for the first time investigated on a large part of the species distribution range, encompassing Uzbekistan, southern Kazakhstan, and northern and eastern Iran. In 59 tortoises, four haplotypes were discovered, including two (AH1 and AH2), described earlier. Haplotype AH1 was detected in 52 tortoises, inhabiting southern Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Haplotype AH2 was found in four tortoises from the border territory between Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan. Two novel haplotypes, AH3 and AH4, were detected in the three tortoises from Iran. Based on nucleotide substitutions in the 12S rDNA sequence, the possible divergence time between the tortoises from different parts of the range was estimated. Possible pathways of the formation of modern intraspecific groups of A. horsfieldii are discussed.

AB  - Reproductive success is a critical measure of an organism's fitness. Determining reproductive success in vertebrates is confounded by the concealed mechanism and timing of fertilization (e.g., sperm competition and storage). To assess the relationship between observed mating behavior and reproductive success in the central Asian tortoise, Testudo horsfieldii Gray, 1844, we determined individual genotypes from a captive colony of adults and their offspring. We constructed a size-selected genomic library from T horsfieldii and screened for polymorphic microsatellite markers. The screen resulted in identification of two novel microsatellite regions. Cross-species amplification of microsatellite markers using primers developed for the bog turtle, Glyptemys muhlenbergii (Schoepff, 1801), resulted in isolation of three additional polymorphic microsatellites for T horsfieldii. The five loci, which have between 5 and 17 alleles and observed heterozygosities between 0.44 and 0.90, were used to determine the frequency of multiple paternity in the captive colony. We found evidence for multiple paternity in 27% of the clutches examined, as well as evidence for overwinter sperm storage and variance in adult male reproductive success. These data indicate that ample opportunity exists for sperm competition and female mate choice in T. horsfieldii.

AB  - Using a nearly range-wide sampling, we investigated phylogeographic differentiation and mitochondrial diversity of Testudo horsfieldii, the only tortoise species confined to Central Asia. We identified three major haplotype clades with mainly parapatric distribution that do not correspond well to the currently recognized three subspecies. One clade is restricted to the Fergana Valley and seems to represent a previously overlooked evolutionarily significant unit. Another clade, consisting of several largely parapatrically distributed haplotypes, occurs in the north and the central southern part of the species' range. The third clade, likewise comprising several largely parapatrically distributed haplotypes, was identified from the southeastern corner of the Caspian Sea in the west, from Afghanistan and Pakistan in the east and from two more northerly sites in western and south-eastern Uzbekistan. It is possible that this clade also occurs in eastern Turkmenistan and adjacent Afghanistan, regions not sampled for the present study. The generally parapatric distribution of individual haplotypes, even within each of the three major clades, suggests advanced lineage sorting, either due to limited dispersal abilities, glacial isolation in distinct local microrefuges or both acting in accord. The localized distribution of endemic haplotypes in the northern and central plains as well as in the mountainous eastern and southern parts of the distribution range supports the existence of multiple microrefuges there. Records of haplotypes of distinct clades in sympatry or close geographic proximity are likely the result of Holocene range expansions. In recent years, thousands of confiscated steppe tortoises were released into the wild. The detected mitochondrial differentiation offers a powerful tool for nature conservation, as a means of determining the geographic origin of confiscated tortoises and selecting suitable reintroduction regions.

AB  - Cryptosporidiosis in squamates is well documented, but there is very limited information available on cryptosporidiosis in testudines. We describe three cases of cryptosporidiosis in tortoises with associated pathology. Two Russian tortoises (Agrionemys [Testudo] horsfieldii) and a pancake tortoise (Malacochersus tornieri), all from separate collections, were found dead. At necropsy, two had histological evidence of intestinal cryptosporidiosis and one had gastric cryptosporidiosis. Consensus Cryptosporidium sp. PCR and sequencing was used to identify the Cryptosporidium sp. present in these three tortoises. In the juvenile Russian tortoise with gastric cryptosporidiosis, the organism had 98% homology with a previously reported sequence from an Indian star tortoise isolate. A second chelonian Cryptosporidium sp. was identified in the pancake tortoise and the second Russian tortoise. This sequence was 100% identical to a shorter gene sequence previously reported in a marginated tortoise. This is the first report coordinating pathology with Cryptosporidium characterization in chelonians. The two Cryptosporidium sp. found in tortoises segregate according to site of infection, and there may be further differences in pathology, host range, and transmission. These Cryptosporidium sp. appear to be able to infect diverse tortoise host species. This may be an under-recognized problem in tortoises. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Herpesviruses are found in free-living and captive chelonian populations, often in association with morbidity and mortality. To date, all known chelonian herpesviruses fall within the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae. We detected a novel herpesvirus in 3 species of chelonians: a captive leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis) in western TX, USA; a steppe tortoise (Testudo [Agrionemys] horsfieldii) found near Fort Irwin, CA, USA; and 2 free-living, three-toed box turtles (Terrapene mexicana triunguis) found in Forest Park, St. Louis, MO. The leopard tortoise was coinfected with the tortoise intranuclear coccidian and had clinical signs of upper respiratory tract disease. The steppe tortoise had mucopurulent nasal discharge and lethargy. One of the three-toed box turtles had no clinical signs; the other was found dead with signs of trauma after being observed with blepharedema, tympanic membrane swelling, cervical edema, and other clinical signs several weeks prior to death. Generally, the branching order of the turtle herpesviruses mirrors the divergence patterns of their hosts, consistent with codivergence. Based on phylogenetic analysis, this novel herpesvirus clusters with a clade of viruses that infect emydid hosts and is likely of box turtle origin. Therefore, we suggest the name terrapene alphaherpesvirus 3 (TerAHV3) for the novel virus. This virus also has the ability to host-jump to tortoises, and previously documented herpesviral morbidity tends to be more common in aberrant hosts. The relationship between clinical signs and infection with TerAHV3 in these animals is unclear, and further investigation is merited.

AB  - Herpesvirus infection in tortoises is largely characterized by the development of respiratory clinical signs. Usually lesions develop in the respiratory, oral pharyngeal, intestinal tract and are accompanied by cutaneous and ocular lesions. In chelonids affected by herpesvirus, systemic-type lesions in organs such as the liver and spleen are commonly observed. In this paper we describe a case of multifocal necrotic hepatitis associated with herpesviruses in an adult female land tortoise of the species Testudo horsfieldii. This article is the first description of a viral hepatitis in Testudo spp. with lesions compatible with herpesvirus infection, with no clinical signs or lesions in the respiratory system, oral cavity or other organs.

AB  - Osteocytes are embedded in the bone matrix, and they communicate with adjacent osteocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts through the osteocyte lacunocanalicular system. Osteocytes are believed to be essential for the maintenance of bone homeostasis because they regulate mechanical sensing and mineral metabolism in mammalian bones; however, osteocyte morphology in other vertebrates has not been well documented. We conducted a comparative study on the morphology of osteocytes and the lacunocanalicular system of the following vertebrates: two teleost fishes [medaka (Oryzias latipes), and zebrafish (Danio rerio)], three amphibians [African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis), black-spotted pond frog (Rana nigromaculata), and Japanese fire-bellied newt (Cynops pyrrhogaster)], two reptiles [four-toed tortoise (Testudo horsfieldii) and green iguana (Iguana iguana)], and two mammals (laboratory mouse C57BL6 and human). The distribution of the osteocyte lacunocanalicular system in all these animals was investigated using the modified silver staining and the fluorescein-conjugated phalloidin staining methods. Bones of medaka had few osteocytes (acellular bone). Bones of zebrafish contained osteocytes (cellular bone) but had a poorly developed osteocyte lacunocanalicular system. Bones of Xenopus laevis, a freshwater species, and of other amphibians, reptiles, and mammals contained numerous osteocytes and a well-developed lacunocanalicular system. The present study indicates that development of the osteocyte lacunocanalicular system differs between teleost fishes and land vertebrates, but this pattern is not directly related to aquatic habitat.

AB  - Herpesvirus infections are significant in the care of turtles and tortoises. Clinical signs range from unspecific symptoms, due to the variety of organ manifestations, to the "classical" picture of rhinitis-stomatitis. The presented case study showed the typical disease only with respect to clinical symptoms following hibernation, but lacks stomatitis, erosions or plaques in the oral mucosa. On the other hand, skin lesions on the extremeties, causative with herpesvirus infection, could be diagnosed. In this case study, various symptoms, sampling procedures and diagnostics using two different PCR methods are presented. Following hibernation, samples from a Russian tortoise (Agrionemys horsfieldii) were taken ante mortem and postmortem and screened with respect to virology, pathology, bacteriology and parasitology. DNA-fragments specific for tortoise herpesvirus were detected in various organs and body liquids. Furthermore basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies were found. The bacteriological examination showed a high level of Pasteurella testunis in the lungs. By parasitological examination nematodes (Oxyridae) were diagnosed. A potential prophylaxis for tortoise herpesvirus is discussed.

AB  - We tested samples from 1,015 chelonians in Europe for Mycoplasma spp., herpesviruses, ranaviruses, picornaviruses, and ferlaviruses by PCR. Mycoplasma spp. were detected in 42.1% and herpesviruses were detected in 8.0% of tested chelonians. Differentiation of the herpesviruses revealed that 46.9% of the detected chelonian viruses were testudinid herpesvirus 1 (TeHV-1) and 54.3% were TeHV-3, including co-detections of TeHV-1 and -3 in 3 tortoises. TeHV-4 was detected in a leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis), and a herpesvirus that could not be further characterized was found in a pond slider (Trachemys scripta). Picornaviruses (topiviruses) were detected in 2.2% of the tested animals; ferlaviruses were found in 0.6%; no ranaviruses were detected in any of the animals tested. Mycoplasma spp. were detected significantly more often in Horsfield's tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii), leopard tortoises, and Indian star tortoises (Geochelone elegans) than in other species. Horsfield's tortoises were also significantly more often positive for TeHV-1. Mycoplasma and TeHV-1 were co-detected in 3.0%, and mycoplasma and TeHV-3 in 2.3%. The TeHV-4-positive tortoise was also positive for mycoplasma. Mycoplasma and picornaviruses were co-detected in 1.2% of the tortoises. A spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) was positive for mycoplasma and a ferlavirus. In some cases, >2 pathogens were detected. A significant correlation between mycoplasma and herpesvirus detection was found. Of all tested animals, 47.6% were positive for at least one pathogen, demonstrating the importance of pathogen detection in captive chelonians.

AB  - Objective To characterise four different intramuscular (IM) anaesthetic protocols, two with alfaxalone and two with alfaxalone in combination with medetomidine in terrestrial tortoises.
   Study design Blinded, randomized, cross-over experimental study.
   Animals Nine healthy adult male Horsfield's tortoises (Agrionemys horsfieldii).
   Methods Each tortoise was randomly assigned to one of four different protocols: 1) 10 mg kg(-1) alfaxalone; 2) 10 mg kg(-1) alfaxalone + 0.10 mg kg(-1) medetomidine; 3) 20 mg kg(-1) alfaxalone; and 4) 20 mg kg(-1) alfaxalone + 0.05 mg kg(-1) medetomidine. During the experiment, the following variables were recorded: heart rate; respiratory rate; peripheral nociceptive responses; muscle strength; ability to intubate; palpebral, corneal and tap reflexes; and cloacal temperature.
   Results Protocols 1 and 2 resulted in moderate sedation with no analgesia, and moderate to deep sedation with minimal analgesia, respectively. Protocols 3 and 4 resulted in deep sedation or anaesthesia with variable analgesic effect; these two protocols had the longest total anaesthetic time and allowed intubation in 6/9 and 8/9 tortoises respectively. The total anaesthesia/sedation time produced by alfaxalone was significantly increased (p < 0.05) by the addition of medetomidine. There were no significant differences regarding time to plateau phase and duration of plateau phase. Baseline heart rate of 53 +/- 6 beats minute (1) decreased significantly (p < 0.05) with all protocols, and was lower (p < 0.05) in protocols 3 and 4. Heart rate increased after atipamezole administration, but the increase was transient. In two tortoises, extreme bradycardia with no cardiac activity for 10 minutes was observed with protocols 3 and 4.
   Conclusion and clinical relevance Alfaxalone 10 and 20 mg kg(-1) IM can be used for sedation for non-painful procedures. Alfaxalone in combination with medetomidine can be used for deeper sedation or anaesthesia, but the observed respiratory and cardiovascular depression may limit its use.

AB  - Large numbers of pancake tortoises (Malacochersus tornieri) and Horsfield tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii) in three consignments imported into Japan died soon after arrival. Some tortoises in the first consignment were dead on arrival. Postmortem examination of two of the pancake tortoises and four of the Horsfield tortoises revealed necrotizing lesions of the oral mucosa in both species, primarily in the tongue. Eosinophilic to amphophilic inclusion bodies were visible in the nuclei of mucosal epithelial cells in the lesions. Similar inclusion bodies were observed in the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, stomach, lungs, kidneys, small and large intestines, pancreas, and cerebrum of the pancake tortoises and in the liver, spleen, and pancreas of the Horsfield tortoises. Electron microscopic examination of the cells containing inclusion bodies showed herpesvirus-like particles about 100 nm in diameter in the cytoplasm. Nested polymerase chain reaction analysis using a herpesvirus consensus primer method confirmed the presence of a characteristic herpesvirus base sequence in tissue from these lesions.

AB  - An adult female Russian tortoise (Testudo horsfieldii) was admitted to a veterinary clinic with a 1-week history of anorexia and lethargy. Physical examination revealed significant dehydration and generalized dysecdysis. Blood parameters were all within species-reported limits. Radiography revealed an increased amount of soft tissue opacity within the coelomic cavity and a distinct loss of serosal detail. A large cavitated mass was detected ultrasonographically in the right coelom and a tentative diagnosis of kidney pathology was made. Using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, a partly mineralized heterogeneous mass was seen in the right coelom. After stabilization, a transplastron coeliotomy was performed. A 7 x 5 cm mass, including associated cysts, was removed. The tortoise died 8 h postoperatively and post-mortem examination revealed a urothelial carcinoma arising from the renal pelvis. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report in a tortoise of urothelial carcinoma, which has rarely been reported in reptiles.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We compared variation in phalangeal and carpal morphology of the Central Asian Testudo horsfieldii, a burrow-digging tortoise species, with its sister taxon T. hermanni, a Mediterranean species without extensive digging behaviour. Thirty-two Testudo horsfieldii kazachstanica shared the same phalangeal formula (0-2-2-1-1). The distal carpal 1 and metacarpal 1 as well as the pisiform were consistently lacking, sometimes also the medial centrale. Phalangeal morphology was more variable in Testudo hermanni hermanni. In 29 specimens four phalangeal formulae were found that differed with respect to the reduction of digit 1 (1-2-2-2-1, M-2-2-2-1, D-2-2-2-1, 0-2-2-2-1). The pisiform develops late in ontogeny and is lacking in very most juveniles and subadults. In contrast to T h. kazachstanica, the medial centrale is always present. In both T h. kazachstanica and T h. hermanni carpalia increasingly fuse with age and size. The underlying morphological patterns differ however. The extreme character state in aged T. h. kazachstanica is one large solid bone element, formed by the fused intermedium, ulnare and both centralia. Aged T. h. hermanni have, in contrast, two separate larger carpal elements, one formed by the fused lateral and medial centralia and the other by the fused distal carpalia 1 and 2; the intermedium and ulnare never fuse with one another or with other carpalia. While a partial or complete loss of digit 1 seems to be characteristic for all Testudo species, we propose that the extensive fusion of carpal elements in T horsfieldii is correlated with its natural history because a rigid manus could be advantageous for burrow-digging. Also the reduction of digit 4 (one phalanx present), a rare character among testudinids and not occurring in other Testudo species, could be linked with its mode of life.

AB  - The Middle Asian tortoise Testudo horsfieldii is one of the most radioresistant animals, with Lethal Dose (LD) 50/30 around 500 Gy. Extracts were prepared from different organs of the tortoise, and their biological activity was evaluated. Crude extract from the spleen was found to significantly increase survival of mice treated with lethal doses of radiation. In an iterative process, the active extract was purified by chromatography, and the fractions were screened for biological activity. Various vital parameters were monitored: peripheral blood leukocytes, spleen colonies, mitosis in the bone marrow, and survival after 30 days. The process concluded with the isolation, characterization, and synthesis of the tetrapeptide FTGN, which accelerated repopulation of the irradiated bone marrow at very low concentrations both in vivo and ex vivo. A fluorescently labeled derivative of the peptide was found to selectively associate to CD34(+) stem cells, suggesting that the peptide mediates their proliferation and allows fast repopulation of hematopoietic lineages. Interestingly, the peptide protected animals from alopecia. The studies in experimental animals suggest that treatment with FTGN can potentially benefit patients who suffer bone marrow damage due to radiotherapy or chemotherapy and patients undergoing autologous or allogenic bone marrow transplantation.

AB  - In animal species without parental care, the fitness of males should increase with the number of females encountered, court, and fertilise, and the fitness of females depends strongly on the quantity and quality of resources acquired. This should translate into a marked sex differences in the patterns of space utilisation. We analysed the sex divergences in home range and movements pattern in the steppe tortoise (Testudo horsfieldi) in Uzbekistan. From the radio-tracking data of 36 individuals throughout the active season, the home range of the male steppe tortoise was estimated to be smaller than that of the female (24 vs. 57 ha), even when the analysis focused on the mating season only. During the mating season, males intensively patrolled a small area, going back and forth within their territory, thereby covering greater distances than females. The females movements were more unidirectional, resulting in large loops over a very extended home range. We proposed several nonexclusive hypothesis for such a pattern.

AB  - In six tortoises (3 spur-tailed mediterranean land tortoises, Testudo hermanni, 2 Horsefield's tortoises, Agrionemys horsfieldii, and one spur-thighed mediterranean land tortoise, Tesfudo graeca) from Austrian keepers herpesvirus-infections occurred. All animals showed massive diphtheroid stomatitis and glossitis. Histologically intranuclear inclusion bodies were found in large numbers in epithelial cells of the tongue. Intranuclear inclusion bodies were also detected in liver cells and in respiratory epithelial cells in one tortoise and in neurons in the brain of another animal. The inclusions consisted of nonenveloped hexagonal nucleocapsides. They measured about 110 to 140 nm and were identified as herpesviruses.
   A cytopathic effect was observed in a chicken embryo fibroblast cellculture.

AB  - The aim of the investigations was to draw up reference blood values of European tortoises, which are more and more frequent patients in veterinary practice. Blood samples were taken from the Vena jugularis from 229 clinically healthy adult European tortoises, belonging to the species Testudo hermanni, T. graeca, T. marginata and Agrionemys horsfieldii. Blood samples were taken during the period of a year. The following 31 parameters were examined (results = mean value +/- standard deviation): haemoglobin (7.84 +/- 1.86 g/dl), PCV (28.0 +/- 6.1%), red cell count (0.63 +/- 0.19 x 10(6)/mul) and white cell count (8.73 +/- 6.86 x 10(3)/mul) including differentiation of lymphocytes, heterophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, calcium (8.7 +/- 6.7 mg/dl), magnesium (5.1 +/- 2.5 mg/dl), phosphorus (5.1 +/- 3.1 mg/dl), alkaline phosphatase (445 +/- 293 IU/l), alanine aminotransferase (22 +/- 18 IU/l), aspartate aminotransferase (108 +/- 79 IU/l), gamma-glutamyltansferase (0 IU/l), lactate dehydrogenase (1433 +/- 1029 IU/l), creatine kinase (1156 +/- 1379 IU/l), amylase (190 +/- 96 IU/l), lipase (57 +/- 42 IU/l), glucose (67.9 +/- 38.1 mg/dl), total protein (4.6 +/- 1.6 mg/dl), albumin (1.6 +/- 0.8 mg/dl), globulin (2.9 mg/dl), urea (18.1 +/- 55.9 mg/dl), uric acid (3.2 +/- 1.9 mg/dl), ammonia (519 +/- 314 mu mol/l), creatinine (0.14 +/- 0.15 mg/dl), cholesterol (141 +/- 70 mg/dl), triglycerides (285 +/- 264 mg/dl) and total bilirubin (0 mg/dl). Nine parameters showed statistically significant differences between sexes. 14 parameters showed more or less clearly distinct statistically significant seasonal variations. Species specific variations occurred in 11 parameters. 20 parameters were influenced by the conditions of husbandry. Blood samples may yield valuable information especially on infections, renal and liver disease in tortoises.

AB  - We documented differential blood cell counts and plasma pollypeptide profiles in Testudo graeca and 7: horsfieldii raised in captivity in Lebanon, and investigated bioactivity of T graeca plasma against a human colon cancer cell line (HCT-116). The percentage of red blood cells, thrombocytes, heterophills, basophills, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils did not differ significantly between the species during winter or spring. The total number of plasma polypeptides differed between the species, with 2 additional polypeptide bands in 7: horsfieldii. Plasma from T graeca significantly affected the percentage proliferation and percentage viability of human cancer cell line HCT-116.

AB  - In spring 2020, a severe disease outbreak with high morbidity and mortality was observed in a collection of 15 Horsfield's tortoises (Testudo horsfieldio). Affected tortoises showed upper respiratory- and gastrointestinal tract signs, including rhinitis and stomatitis. Testudinid herpesvirus 1 (TeHV1) and Mycoplasmo spp. were detected by PCR in oral swabs of affected animals. Histological examination of one deceased animal showed intranuclear inclusion bodies typical for herpesvirus infections in liver, spleen and oesophagus. The virus was likely introduced into the collection 2 years earlier by a clinically healthy Horsfield's tortoise that was tested positive for TeHV1 by PCR.

AB  - The steppe tortoise (Testudo horsfieldi) is probably the most widespread and abundant of all living terrestrial tortoises, but paradoxically, this chelonian as been studied only superficially. Steppe tortoise populations are declining rapidly as a result of massive harvesting for the pet trade and extensive disruption of their habitat by intensive agriculture. Thus, it is urgent to acquire accurate information on major life-history traits. Our 5-year field study at the Djeiron Ecocenter in the Republic of Uzbekistan indicates that steppe tortoises usually remain buried in one place for over 9 months, which helps them cope with the extreme environmental conditions that occur in summer, fall, and winter. After emerging in late winter, steppe tortoises have less than 3 months in spring to forage to obtain the fuel needed for growth and reproduction, and replenish the body reserves necessary for the subsequent 9 months of total starvation. The mating period occurred between the end of March and mid-April and the egg-laying period from the end of April to mid-June. Using radio-tracking and focal sampling, we measured the time devoted to different activities by males and females. During the mating period, males allocated a large proportion of their daily activity to sexual behaviours, whereas females' sexual activity tended to be cryptic. However, males devoted less time to feeding and resting than did females. During the postmating period, both males and females spent much time foraging. The strong sexual divergences indicate that each sex copes differently with the extreme continental climate. The seasonal and interannual changes in body mass indicate complex interactions between climatic conditions, activity budget, and body reserves.

AB  - Herbivorous vertebrates of and regions are frequently faced with inadequate food quality, quantity or both. The time and energy devoted to foraging is vital to balancing their energy budgets. For desert ectotherms, a low metabolism should be advantageous, reducing their total energy requirement, but extreme ambient temperatures can strongly constrain these animals' activity periods. We provide the first data on the activity budgets, foraging behaviour and diet of a highly abundant, desert-dwelling, herbivorous ectotherm, the steppe tortoise Testudo horsfieldi. Extreme climatic conditions of Central Asia limit steppe tortoise's activity to only three months per year. They remain inactive most of their "active season" (90%), and spend very little time foraging (< 15 min per day). This suggests that steppe tortoises can satisfy their energy requirements with modest feeding efforts. Interestingly, steppe tortoises avoid feeding on grass species and feed mostly on plant species that are usually highly toxic to mammals. This result suggests that steppe tortoises and ungulates do not compete for food.

AB  - Objective: The cardiac anatomy in tortoises depicted on B-mode and color-Doppler should be better differentiated by additional contrast-echocardiography. Material and methods: An intravenous contrast agent (INN-sulphur hexafluoride [SonoVue (R)]) was injected in four tortoises (three Testudo hermanni, one Agrionemys horsfieldii), via the coccygeal vein, with parallel B-mode echocardiographic examination. The results of the contrast-enhanced echocardiography were compared with the contrast-free B-mode recordings and color-Doppler ultrasound. Results: The use of SonoVue enabled clearer distinction of the cardiac structures, differentiation of the arising major arteries, identification of wash-out-shunts, and visualization of blood flow patterns throughout the tortoise heart. Conclusion and clinical relevance: This study enables the accurate depiction and differentiation of cardiac anatomy in tortoises through the use of a combination of B-mode, color-Doppler and contrast-echocardiography. Basic knowledge of blood flow in the reptile heart is essential to understand echocardiographic anatomy. Blood-flow-patterns and anatomy of the tortoise heart as found in this study will help to establish a basis for further echocardiographic examinations of these animals.

AB  - To assess implications for public health we compared the resistance of Enterococcus spp. strains to antibacterial drugs in wild and exotic animals with strains originating in domesticated animals and characterized correlations between Enterococcus species, the source of the isolate, and the degree of resistance to selected antibiotics. All strains, regardless of source, were susceptible to beta-lactams, gentamicin, linezolid, and teicoplanin; the highest resistance was to kanamycin, quinupristin, and rifampicin. Thirteen strains from undomesticated animals were resistant to vancomycin, and one strain, from a fox, was resistant to streptomycin (high-dose). Multidrug-resistant strains accounted for 46% of the strains from wild animals and 59% of the strains from an exotic animal (the Russian tortoise; Testudo horsfieldii). Despite the relatively low level of resistance in the strains isolated from wild and exotic animals, the large number of intermediately susceptible strains in these groups is an indication of the evolutionary character of the development of resistance, suggesting that these animals may be potential reservoirs of Enterococcus strains resistant to a wide panel of currently used antibiotics.

AB  - Abnormalities and the postnatal development of the carapace were investigated in 106 captive tortoises (Testudini-dae, Testudo hermanni boettgeri, Testudo graeca, Testudo marginata, Testudo horsfieldii) using computer tomography (CT) in live animals and/or dissection of preserved specimens. The carapace was reconstructed two-dimensionally through combining sectional images. The postnatal ossification was demonstrated in 3D CT images combined with dissection results. We found that abnormal numbers and arrangements of horny scutes and bony plates may occur independently at different locations and different ontogenetic stages. Abnormalities of the horny scutes are present at hatching when the bony plates are not yet fully formed. The temporal course of carapace ossification appears to be species-specific. We demonstrate that computer tomography is a non-invasive and convenient method suitable for studying abnormalities and the postnatal ossification process of the bony carapace, as well as for diagnostics in live chelonians. However, the resolution limit of the method will be reached in the case of very young or metabolically challenged subjects.

AB  - During the months of April to August in 1999 and 2002, oral swabs were collected from 146 tortoises (Testudo sp.) in private collections in the United Kingdom and tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of Mycoplasma agassizii and Chelonian herpesvirus (ChHV). The presence of M. agassizii was confirmed by restriction digestion of the PCR product. A 307-bp fragment of the ChHV UL5 homologue gene was sequenced and found to show most similarity to equine herpesvirus type 1. A prevalence of 15.8 and 8.2% was found for M. agassizii and ChHV, respectively. Comparison of the carriage of both M. agassizii and ChHV in different species of tortoises correlated the presence of M. agassizii with Testudo horsfieldii and ChHV with Testudo marginata and Testudo graeca iberia. An association of ChHV with stomatitis was also found. Mixed infections with both agents were detected. The findings further demonstrate this pathogen-tortoise association and the cross transmission of these infections if different tortoise species are housed together.

AB  - Specialization for a new habitat often entails a cost to performance in the ancestral habitat. Although aquatic lifestyles are ancestral among extant cryptodiran turtles, multiple lineages, including tortoises (Testudinidae) and emydid box turtles (genus Terrapene), independently specialized for terrestrial habitats. To what extent is swimming function retained in such lineages despite terrestrial specialization? Because tortoises diverged from other turtles over 50 Ma, but box turtles did so only 5 Ma, we hypothesized that swimming kinematics for box turtles would more closely resemble those of aquatic relatives than those of tortoises. To test this prediction, we compared high-speed video of swimming Russian tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii), box turtles (Terrapene carolina) and two semi-aquatic emydid species: sliders (Trachemys scripta) and painted turtles (Chrysemys picta). We identified different kinematic patterns between limbs. In the forelimb, box turtle strokes most resemble those of tortoises; for the hindlimb, box turtles are more similar to semi-aquatic species. Such patterns indicate functional convergence of the forelimb of terrestrial species, whereas the box turtle hindlimb exhibits greater retention of ancestral swimming motions.

AB  - The morphology and topography of the ciliary ganglia in the midday gerbil and turtle were studied with use of histochemical and histological techniques. The ciliary ganglion of the midday gerbil consisted of two cell agglomerations: the main ganglion and the accessory ganglion. The main ganglion was situated in the orbit and usually closely attached to the nerve for the inferior oblique muscle. The short ciliary nerves arose from the superior end of the main ganglion and reached the orbit. The accessory ciliary ganglion was smaller than the main ganglion. Usually it was attached to short ciliary nerves. The ganglionic neurocytes, 25.97 mum in diameter, were distributed regularly over the entire surface of the main ganglion. They typically had a single clear nucleus.
   The ciliary ganglion in the turtle formed a characteristic triangular structure on the inferior branch of the oculomotor nerve. The histological examination showed a small number of nerve cells in comparison to the nerve fibres. The neurocytes were placed mainly in the nasal part of ganglion and they had an irregular arrangement. The average diameter of neurons was 23.55 mum.
   Significant differences in density of ganglionic components in both species were observed. In midday gerbil the cells were densely packed and took up about 80% of a cross-section, while, in the turtle, neurocytes were located mainly in the surface part of ganglion.

AB  - Takhar Province of Afghanistan was previously known to harbour only two species of amphibians and eight species of reptiles with no record of snake species. From 2020 to 2021, we collected herpetological data from the Province and identified 14 species and specimens representing species complexes (Bufotes viridis complex and Trapelus agilis complex), with first records of Testudo horsfieldii (Testudinidae), Paralaudakia badakhshana (Agamidae), Pseudopus apodus (Anguidae), Tenuidactylus caspius (Gekkonidae), Eumeces schneideri (Scincidae) and Varanus griseus (Varanidae). In addition, we report the first province records of snakes, including Eryx tataricus (Erycidae), Hemorrhois ravergieri (Colubridae), Natrix tessellata (Natricidae) and the venomous species Naja oxiana (Elapidae). These records connect and supplement previously obtained data of these species from surrounding provinces and neighbouring countries. Our data reveal that Takhar Province is home to at least 20 species of amphibians and reptiles with a strong affiliation to the Turanian chorotype. All these data are a significant source of information for the diversity of herpetofauna in Afghanistan and subsequent biodiversity research in the Central Asiatic region.

AB  - Forty-five Horsfield's tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii; syn. Agrionemys horfieldii, Russian tortoise) belonging to different owners had decreased appetite and respiratory issues. Twenty-nine tortoises had epiphora, dyspnea, and white necrotic diphtheroid oral plaques (group G1). Ten of the remaining 16 tortoises had serious dehydration, appetite disorder, and depression (G2). The last 6 tortoises had only decreased appetite and moderate conjunctival discharge (G3). During the physical examination of all 45 tortoises, a cytologic sample and an oral swab for herpesvirus and Mycoplasma agassizii PCR testing were taken. In 20 of 29 specimens from G1, in 8 of 16 from G2, and 0 of 6 from G3, the cytologic exam revealed intranuclear acidophilic inclusion bodies, multinucleate cellular syncytia, and further abnormalities caused by herpesviral infection. Moreover, all 45 tested subjects were found to be positive for testudinid herpesvirus 1; 2 were positive for M. agassizii. This prospective study suggests that Horsfield's tortoises with such signs would benefit from this screening procedure, given that it was effective in a significant proportion of infected and symptomatic animals, and no negative effects were seen.

TI  - RAPD variation in Mediterranean turtle Testudo graeca L. (Testudinidae)
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS
LA  - English
AB  - The polymerase chain reaction with arbitrary primers (RAPD-PCR) was used to study intraspecific variation in Mediterranean turtle Testudo graeca, which is represented by the Dagestan (T. g. pallasi) and Nikolskii (T. g. nikolskii) subspecies in Russia. To study the phylogenetic relationships, the RAPD variation was also compared in two other T. graeca subspecies (T. g. ibera and T. g. terrestris), two closely related Testudo species (T. kleinmanni and T. marginata), and Central Asian turtle Agrionemys horsfieldii. Parameters of RAPD variation showed that the sample from different geographical regions of Dagestan was more polymorphic and heterogeneous than that from Central Asia. The two samples differed in the mean number of RAPD fragments N (48.76 vs. 40.40), number of polymorphic fragments P (78.7 vs. 32.3), and within-group similarity index APS (0.607 vs. 0.784). In T. g. pallasi, no significant difference in N, P, or APS was observed between samples from different localities of Dagestan or between groups of turtles with four- or five-clawed forelegs. A dendrogram of genetic similarity between the species and subspecies under study contained two clusters, one comprising all A. horsfieldii individuals and the other, all turtles of the genus Testudo. In the latter, T. marginata and T. kleinmanni showed higher similarity to each other than to T. graeca. The four T. graeca subspecies clustered separately from each other with a high reliability, T. g. nikolskii and T. g. ibera (Turkey) being more similar to each other than to T. g. terrestris or T. g. pallasi. The possible causes of the presence of four claws on forelegs of turtles from Dagestan and the relationships among members of the genus Testudo were discussed.

AB  - To test phylogenetic relationships within the genus Testudo (Testudines: Testudinidae), we have sequenced a fragment of the mitochondrial (mt) 12S rRNA gene of 98 tortoise specimens belonging to the genera Testudo, Indotestudo, and Geochelone. Maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining methods identify two main clades of Mediterranean tortoises, one composed of the species Testudo graeca, Testudo marginata, and Testudo kleinmanni and a second of Testudo hermanni, Testudo horsfieldii, and Indotestudo elongata. The first clade, but not the second, was also supported by maximum parsimony analysis. Together with the genus Geochelone, a star-like radiation of these clades was suggested, as a sister-group relationship between the two Testudo clades could not be confirmed. The intraspecies genetic variation was examined by sequencing the mt 12S rRNA fragment from 28 specimens of T. graeca and 49 specimens of T. hermanni from various geographic locations. Haplotype diversity was found to be significantly larger in T. graeca compared with T. hermanni, suggestive of reduced genetic diversity in the latter species, perhaps due to Pleistocene glaciations affecting northern and middle Europe or other sources of lineage reduction. No ancient mt 12S rRNA gene haplotypes were identified in T. graeca and/or T. hermanni originating from islands in the Mediterranean Sea, suggesting that these islands harbor tortoise populations introduced from the European and African mainland.

AB  - Despite gastrointestinal parasites being commonly diagnosed in captive tortoises throughout the UK, there is a lack of data regarding the prevalence. The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in tortoises in the UK, and to investigate the factors affecting the prevalence of these parasites. Owners were invited to submit a faecal sample from their tortoise in conjunction with a completed questionnaire covering details of signalment and husbandry. Data from the questionnaires were analysed at the end of the study. Faecal analysis was performed on samples from Testudo hermanni, Testudo graeca and Testudo horsfieldii. This involved examination of direct wet preparations, a modified McMaster technique, passive NaCl flotation and Cryptosporidium staining. Of the 142 samples used, 130 were examined by the first three methods. 49 per cent were positive for one or more parasites. Of the positive samples, 67 per cent were positive for oxyurids, 28 per cent were positive for ascarids and 28 per cent were positive for protozoa (Balantidium, Nyctotherus or flagellates). Only 1/113 (0.8 per cent) samples was positive for Cryptosporidium. The most important risk factors for parasites were sex (F) and length of time (<5 years) in owner's possession. This survey showed that gastrointestinal parasites are frequently detected in the faecal samples of captive tortoises in the UK, but their prevalence may be influenced by various factors including sex, length of time owned, age and species.

AB  - Distribution pattern, prevalence and intensity of parasitaemia of heteroxenous apicomplexan blood parasite Hemolivia mauritanica and its vector tick Hyalomma aegyptium have been studied in 264 tortoises (212 Testudo graeca and 52 T. horsfieldii) throughout the Iranian territory. In T. graeca the highest prevalence and intensity of parasitaemia for H. mauritanica were recorded in the temperate mid and northern parts of the Iranian plateau, while the lowest values were found in the arid central part of Iran. No Hemolivia-positive samples were found in T. horsfieldii. Hyalomma aegyptium ticks were diagnosed in both tortoise species. The highest prevalence and intensity of infestation with H. aegyptium were recorded in western part of Iran, where climatic conditions are not so arid compared to central and eastern parts. No significant differences were found in intensity of parasitaemia of H. mauritanica between males and females. Similarly, no differences in intensity of parasitaemia were detected between different age groups (adults; more than 10 years, young; 5-10 years and juveniles; less that 5 years). Prevalence of H. mauritanica and H. aegyptium in adults was higher than in young and in juveniles. While intensity of infestation with H. aegyptium was significantly higher in adult tortoises compare to juveniles, no significant difference were found between intensity of H. aegyptium infestation in male and female tortoises.

AB  - A complex wide-range study on the haemoproteid parasites of chelonians was carried out for the first time. Altogether, 811 samples from four tortoise species from an extensive area between western Morocco and eastern Afghanistan and between Romania and southern Syria were studied by a combination of microscopic and molecular-genetic methods. Altogether 160 Haemoproteus-positive samples were gathered in the area between central Anatolia and eastern Afghanistan. According to variability in the cytochrome b gene, two monophyletic evolutionary lineages were distinguished; by means of microscopic analysis it was revealed that they corresponded to two previously described species-Haemoproteus anatolicum and Haemoproteus caucasica. Their distribution areas overlap only in a narrow strip along the Zagros Mts. range in Iran. This fact suggests the involvement of two different vector species with separated distribution. Nevertheless, no vectors were confirmed. According to phylogenetic analyses, H. caucasica represented a sister group to H. anatolicum, and both of them were most closely related to H. pacayae and H. peltocephali, described from South American river turtles. Four unique haplotypes were revealed in the population of H. caucasica, compared with seven haplotypes in H. anatolicum. Furthermore, H. caucasica was detected in two tortoise species, Testudo graeca and Testudo horsfieldii, providing evidence that Haemoproteus is not strictly host-specific to the tortoise host species.

AB  - Selective forces shape sexes differently, with male body proportions facing strong selection to enhance mate searching and male-to-male combat traits, and female fitness being influenced by the ability to assimilate large amounts of nutrients necessary for vitellogenesis (and/or gestation), and their ability to carry the eggs or embryos. We evaluated the sexual dimorphism of body proportion of more than 800 wild steppe tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii) in Uzbekistan. The thick, well-developed shell offers protection from predators but pronounced digging habits probably also constrain body shape (e.g. a shell that is dorso-ventrally flattened, although round from a dorsal view helps to penetrate into, and move within the soil). Thus, in this species, natural selection might favour a heavy and flat shell that is 'closed' with small openings for appendages. In males, these environmental influences appear to be countered by sexual selection. Compared to females, they weigh less (absolutely and relative to shell dimensions), have longer legs, have shell structure allowing wider movements for their legs, and they walk faster. Males were also able to right themselves more quickly than females did in experimental tests. This quick righting ability is critical because intra-sexual combats frequently result in males being flipped onto their backs and becoming prone to hyperthermia or predation. Females are heavily built, with wide shells (relative to male shells), which may provide space for carrying eggs. From our results, a number of simple hypotheses can be tested on a wide range of chelonian species. (C) 2001 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - Age and size at maturity are determined through complex interactions among size at birth, growth rate, maturation, and survival. We studied sexual size dimorphism and growth rate and maturation patterns in a long-lived organism, the steppe tortoise (Testudo horsfieldi), using the scute lamina number and width as age and growth measures. There was no sexual difference in the juvenile growth rate, but females matured later and hence were larger at maturity than males. We also observed considerable inter-individual variation in age and size at maturity. In both sexes, precocious animals grew faster during the juvenile phase but matured at a smaller body size than did tardy animals. Consequently, maturity did not seem size-dependent per se but rather was determined by growth rate. The strong variation between and within the sexes in age and size at maturity suggest that different growth trajectories and maturation schedules depend upon sex and individual responses to resource availability.

AB  - Blanding's turtles (Emydoidea blandingii), an endangered species in Illinois, have experienced range-wide declines because of habitat degradation and fragmentation, predation, and road mortality. While ongoing studies are crucial to a thorough understanding of the natural history and demographics in these disjointed Illinois populations, infectious disease threats have been largely unevaluated. Herpesvirus outbreaks have been associated with high morbidity and mortality in populations of captive tortoises and turtles worldwide, including the family Emydidae (pond and box turtles). However, novel herpesviruses including Terrapene herpesvirus 1, Emydid herpesvirus 1 and 2, and Glyptemys herpesvirus 1 and 2, have recently been identified in apparently healthy free ranging freshwater turtles. In 2015, 20 free-ranging Blanding's turtles in DuPage County, Illinois were screened for a herpesvirus using consensus PCR. A novel herpesvirus species (Emydoidea herpesvirus 1; EBHV1) was identified in two animals and shared a high degree of sequence homology to other freshwater turtle herpes viruses. Two quantitative real-time PCR assays, using EBHV1 primer-1 and primer-2, were developed to target an EBHV1-specific segment of the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase gene and validated. Both assays performed with high efficiency (slope = -3.2; R-2 = 1), low intra-assay variability, and low inter-assay variability (coefficient of variation < 2% at all dilutions). However, EBHV1 primer-2 displayed less variation and was selected to test clinical samples and five closely related herpesvirus control samples. Results indicate that this assay is specific for EBHV1, has a linear range of detection from 10(8) to 10(1) viral copies per reaction, and can categorically detect as few as 1 viral copy per reaction. This qPCR assay provides a valuable diagnostic tool for future characterization of EBHV1 epidemiology.

AB  - Herpesviruses are important pathogens in tortoises and turtles, yet little is known about the epidemiology of these viruses. We analyzed herpesviruses detected by PCR in samples from captive chelonians in Europe according to virus strain, host species, year and season in which the animal was tested, and country in which the animal was kept. A total of 4,797 samples submitted to a diagnostic laboratory in Europe between January 2016 and December 2020 were evaluated. Of these, 312 (6.50%) were positive for herpesviruses. The types most commonly found were testudinid herpesvirus (TeHV)1 (143 positive, 45.83%) and TeHV3 (153 positive, 49.04%), but also included TeHV2 (1 positive, 0.32%), TeHV4 (3 positive, 0.96%), Terrapene herpesvirus 1 (7 positive, 2.24%), Trachemys herpesvirus 1 (2 positive, 0.64%), and three previously undescribed herpesviruses (0.96%). Herpesviruses were detected in chelonians in the families Testudinidae, Emydidae, Geoemydidae, and in the suborder Pleurodira. Among the species for which 100 samples or more were available, the highest proportions of positive samples (positivity rates) were found in samples from Horsfield's tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii) (14.96%), and radiated tortoises (Astrochelys radiata) (14.05%). Among tortoises (Testudinidae), viruses were most often detected in the spring, while in emydid turtles (Emydidae) they were most often detected in the summer. A comparison of the positivity rates according to country showed significant differences, with the highest rate in samples from Italy (16.01%). This study indicated possible differences in herpesvirus positivity rates depending on host species, virus strain, year of sampling, season, and country of origin. It provides useful information in further understanding fluctuations in infection rates as well as in helping to guide decision making for herpesvirus diagnostics in chelonian patients. It also provides evidence for the international dispersal of herpesviruses with their hosts through international trade.</p>

AB  - Understanding of the diversity of species of Cryptosporidium Tyzzer, 1910 in tortoises remains incomplete due to the limited number of studies on these hosts. The aim of the present study was to characterise the genetic diversity and biology of cryptosporidia in tortoises of the family Testudinidae Batsch. Faecal samples were individually collected immediately after defecation and were screened for presence of cryptosporidia by microscopy using aniline-carbol-methyl violet staining, and by PCR amplification and sequence analysis targeting the small subunit rRNA (SSU), Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) and actin genes. Out of 387 faecal samples from 16 tortoise species belonging to 11 genera, 10 and 46 were positive for cryptosporidia by microscopy and PCR, respectively. All samples positive by microscopy were also PCR positive. Sequence analysis of amplified genes revealed the presence of the Cryptosporidium tortoise genotype I (n = 22), C. ducismarci Traversa, 2010 (n = 23) and tortoise genotype III (n = 1). Phylogenetic analyses of SSU, COWP and actin gene sequences revealed that Cryptosporidium tortoise genotype I and C. ducismarci are genetically distinct from previously described species of Cryptosporidium. Oocysts of Cryptosporidium tortoise genotype I, measuring 5.8-6.9 mum x 5.3-6.5 mum, are morphologically distinguishable from C. ducismarci, measuring 4.4-5.4 mum x 4.3-5.3 mum. Oocysts of Cryptosporidium tortoise genotype I and C. ducismarci obtained from naturally infected Russian tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii Gray) were infectious for the same tortoise but not for Reeve's turtles (Mauremys reevesii [Gray]), common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis [Linnaeus]), zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata [Vieillot]) and SCID mice (Mus musculus Linnaeus). The prepatent period was 11 and 6 days post infection (DPI) for Cryptosporidium tortoise genotype I and C. ducismarci, respectively; the patent period was longer than 200 days for both cryptosporidia. Naturally or experimentally infected tortoises showed no clinical signs of disease. Our morphological, genetic, and biological data support the establishment of Cryptosporidium tortoise genotype I as a new species, Cryptosporidium testudinis sp. n., and confirm the validity of C. ducismarci as a separate species of the genus Cryptosporidium.

AB  - We examined the effects of antagonists and an agonist of the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) on the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous postsynaptic potentials (PSP) and of the miniature fraction of these potentials in the lumbar segments of the spinal cord of the steppe tortoise (in 2- to 3-mm-thick superfused slices). We demonstrated that a common antagonist of the group-I and group-II mGIuR, (+)MCPG (400 muM), as well as selective antagonists, MCCG (200 muM) and EGLU (100-200 muM), and a selective agonist of the group-II, DCG IV (1 muM), change the frequency of spontaneous PSP, including miniature PSP, but practically do not influence their amplitude. This feature shows that mGIuR are presynaptically localized both in premotoneuronal links and immediately in synaptic contacts on the motoneurons. Comparison of the effects of antagonists of the mGIuR on the normal synaptic activity and on that under conditions of GABA receptor blockade shows that mGIuR are involved in modulation of both glutamatergic and GABA-ergic transmission. We surmise that the NMDA reception plays a special role in the realization of mGluR-mediated modulating effects. The directions of the effects of the above antagonists and an agonist of the mGluR (an increase and a decrease in the frequency of synaptic potentials, respectively) allow us to postulate that the presynaptically localized group-II mGIuR causes a decrease in the probability of release of excitatory and inhibitory transmitters in spinal synaptic structures of the tortoise.

AB  - Based on polymorphism of the 12S rRNA gene and RAPD markers, differentiation of 122 tortoise individuals belonging to the three species of genus Testudo (T. kleinmanni, T. marginata, and T. graeca), six subspecies of T. graeca (T. g. nikolskii, T. g. pallasi, T. g. armeniaca, T. g. zarudnyi, T. g. terrestris, T. g. ibera), and two subspecies of the Central Asian tortoise Agrionenemys horsfieldii (A. h. horsfieldii, A. h. kazakhstanica) was performed. For comparison, 32 known sequences of 12S rRNA gene (392 bp) from tortoises of the two genera inhabiting the territories of Europe, Asia, and Africa were used. In the populations of A. horsfieldii, a total of six haplotypes, including three newly described variants, were identified. In the examined tortoises of the genus Testudo, eleven 12S rRNA haplotypes were identified. One new haplotype was detected in T. kleinmanni. Among the eight subspecies of T. graeca, eight haplotypes were identified, with four newly described ones. The reported RAPD markers generally supported the reconstructions obtained with the use of the mitochondrial marker. Similarly to the 12S rRNA-based reconstructions, two independent clusters included representatives of the two genera, Agrionemys and Testudio. Among the latter, representatives of T. marginata and T. kleinmanni, as well as T. graeca, with high statistical support values, formed two reciprocally monophyletic groups. Compared to the mitochondrial markers, RAPDs more statistically significantly discriminated the sample of T. g. terrestris and the four subspecies, T. g. ibera, T. g. armeniaca, T. g. pallasi, and T. g. nikolskii. In almost all cases except the representatives of T. g. ibera, the representatives of each of four subspecies formed individual subclusters. The geographical haplotype distribution patterns and possible evolutionary scenario of the origin and dispersal of tortoises of the two genera are discussed.
