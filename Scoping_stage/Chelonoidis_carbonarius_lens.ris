AB  - We propose that an understanding of animal learning and memory is critical to predicting the impacts of animals on plant populations through processes such as seed dispersal, pollination and herbivory. Focussing on endozoochory, we review the evidence that animal memory plays a role in seed dispersal, and present a model which allows us to explore the fundamental consequences of memory for this process. We demonstrate that decision-making by animals based on their previous experiences has the potential to determine which plants are visited, which fruits are selected to be eaten from the plant and where seeds are subsequently deposited, as well as being an important determinant of animal survival. Collectively, these results suggest that the impact of animal learning and memory on seed dispersal is likely to be extremely important, although to date our understanding of these processes suffers from a conspicuous lack of empirical support. This is partly because of the difficulty of conducting appropriate experiments but is also the result of limited interaction between plant ecologists and those who work on animal cognition. We believe that an improved understanding of the effects of animal memory in endozoochorous interactions will allow better prediction of the impacts of ecosystem changes such as habitat fragmentation, introductions of novel species of plants and animals and reintroductions of animal populations to areas from which they have been extirpated, and hope that the ideas we put forward here provide an impetus for further work in this area.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Cryptogenic species are those whose native and introduced ranges are unknown. The extent and long history of human migration rendered numerous species cryptogenic. Incomplete knowledge regarding the origin and native habitat of a species poses problems for conservation management and may confound ecological and evolutionary studies. The Lesser Antilles pose a particular challenge with regard to cryptogenic species because these islands have been anthropogenically connected since before recorded history. Here, we use population genetic and phylogeographic tools in an attempt to determine the origin of <jats:italic>Eleutherodactylus johnstonei</jats:italic>, a frog species with a potentially widespread introduced range and whose native range within the Lesser Antilles is unknown. Based on elevated estimates of genetic diversity and within-island geographic structure not present elsewhere in the range, we identify Montserrat as the native island of <jats:italic>E. johnstonei</jats:italic>. We also document two major clades within <jats:italic>E. johnstonei</jats:italic>, only one of which is the primary source of introduced populations throughout the Americas. Our results demonstrate the utility of genetic tools for resolving cryptogenic species problems and highlight <jats:italic>E. johnstonei</jats:italic> as a potential system for understanding differences in invasive potential among sister lineages.

AB  - A series of 36 specimens of Geochelone carbonaria from the provinces of Darien and San Blas, Panama, definitely establishes the occurrence of that species in Panama. A population on Isla Pinos (San Blas group) may or may not be natural. The closely related species G. denticulata does not occur in Panama and seems not to occur west of the Cordillera Oriental of Colombia. Geochelone carbonaria prefers a dense forest habitat; although the species is hunted for food, it seems to survive in areas of human population. A detailed description of color, includingf ontogenetic changes, is given. Sexual maturity is attained probably at lengths of 200 to 250 mm. Clutch size is estimated to be 8 to 13 eggs, and length of hatchlings is estimated to be 53 mm. Variation is discussed in some detail, especially for characters which are used to diagnose the species G. carbonaria and G. denticulata. Sexual dimorphism is most evident in shape of shell; old individuals of both sexes have shells which are indented below and constricted about the middle, but the condition is more extreme in males. Shape of shell and head scalation are shown in diagrams. Williams (1960:120) has demonstrated, that two species of tortoises (Geochelone denticulata and G. carbonaria) inhabit northern South America. The two species resemble each other closely and are probably closely related. According to Williams (1960:2), they can be taxonomically separated with ease by using a series of characteristics (shape and texture of shell, color, and scutellation). Using these characteristics, I have found populations of Geochelone in Panama to be clearly referable to carbonaria. The following remarks, based on a total of 38 specimens (including a series of 35 from a small geographic area), provide new information on G. carbonaria at or near the extreme northwestern limit of its geographic range.

AB  - The factors favoring the evolution of certain cognitive abilities in animals remain unclear. Social learning is a cognitive ability that reduces the cost of acquiring personal information and forms the foundation for cultural behavior. Theory predicts the evolutionary pressures to evolve social learning should be greater in more social species. However, research testing this theory has primarily occurred in captivity, where artificial environments can affect performance and yield conflicting results. We compared the use of social and personal information, and the social learning mechanisms used by wild, asocial California scrub-jays and social Mexican jays. We trained demonstrators to solve one door on a multi-door task, then measured the behavior of naïve conspecifics towards the task. If social learning occurs, observations of demonstrators will change the rate that naïve individuals interact with each door. We found both species socially learned, though personal information had a much greater effect on behavior in the asocial species while social information was more important for the social species. Additionally, both species used social information to avoid, rather than copy, conspecifics. Our findings demonstrate that while complex social group structures may be unnecessary for the evolution of social learning, it does affect the use of social versus personal information.

Even though the tortoise is considered to be endangered, export quotas of wild caught specimens have not been examined for many years. We denounce inadequate controls of quotas, as well as farming and ranching practices by evaluating the official CITES statistical data. We present data and arguments that provide evidence of inadequate controls of quotas, as well as farming and ranching practices, based on the official CITES statistical data.

AB  - There is robust experimental evidence for contagious yawning, yet observational studies of naturalistic behavior have been fewer. Without data from real-world behavior, researchers have questioned the existence of contagious yawning and made assumptions about some parameters (e.g., the duration of the effect). We observed contagious yawning in chimpanzees to confirm/disconfirm its existence in the behavioral repertoire of this species, and if present, provide some of the missing descriptives. We recorded yawns on an all-occurrence basis from 18 captive-reared chimpanzees at the Los Angeles Zoo. We recorded identity, time, and individuals who could have been affected. We calculated a threshold for contagion by taking the mean and adding 1.96 standard deviations, constructing a response curve. Across multiple measures we see a consistent pattern in which there is a strong effect of contagion for 1.5 minutes, a less strong but still significant effect lasting up to 3.5 minutes in some measures, and no evidence of contagion beyond 3.5 minutes. From the time stamp on each yawn we were able to rule out temporal synchrony as an alternative hypothesis. Thus, contagious yawning appears to be a natural phenomenon in chimpanzees lending support to the myriad experimental and observational studies to date.

AB  - Introduction of exotic ticks and pathogens through international animal trade (farm animals and pets) is a serious threat to public health and local fauna. Rapid and correct identification of potential threats is an important step on the way to conduct an efficient control of imported pests. In this report we describe the molecular identification of the neotropic tick Amblyomma rotundatum intercepted from red-footed tortoise (Chelonoides carbonaria), imported to Israel from Florida, USA. Molecular analysis of the ticks conducted upon their identification, revealed that they were infected with Rickettsia bellii. Following their collection, the ticks were examined morphologically and five molecular markers were used to determine their taxonomic identity: cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COX1), cytochrome b (CytB), 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA and internal transcribed sequence 2 (ITS-2). Molecular analysis indicated that all of the collected ticks were Amblyomma rotundatum. Using rickettsial gltA (citrate synthase) gene in real-time PCR analysis we found that approximately 25% of the intercepted ticks (8 of 33) were infected with Rickettsia bellii. It is concluded that accurate and timely identification of imported exotic ticks prevented their introduction to Israel, and that use of molecular tools may further improve the response to such potential threats.

AB  - Attending to where others are looking is thought to be of great adaptive benefit for animals when avoiding predators and interacting with group members. Many animals have been reported to respond to the gaze of others, by co-orienting their gaze with group members (gaze following) and/or responding fearfully to the gaze of predators or competitors (i.e., gaze aversion). Much of the literature has focused on the cognitive underpinnings of gaze sensitivity, namely whether animals have an understanding of the attention and visual perspectives in others. Yet there remain several unanswered questions regarding how animals learn to follow or avoid gaze and how experience may influence their behavioral responses. Many studies on the ontogeny of gaze sensitivity have shed light on how and when gaze abilities emerge and change across development, indicating the necessity to explore gaze sensitivity when animals are exposed to additional information from their environment as adults. Gaze aversion may be dependent upon experience and proximity to different predator types, other cues of predation risk, and the salience of gaze cues. Gaze following in the context of information transfer within social groups may also be dependent upon experience with group-members; therefore we propose novel means to explore the degree to which animals respond to gaze in a flexible manner, namely by inhibiting or enhancing gaze following responses. We hope this review will stimulate gaze sensitivity research to expand beyond the narrow scope of investigating underlying cognitive mechanisms, and to explore how gaze cues may function to communicate information other than attention.

AB  - "Face" is a special stimulus in humans and, nonhuman primates, and some other social mammals; that is, they perceive the face differently from the other body parts and other stimuli. In these species, the face conveys much information, so individuals examine the face at first sight rather than other body parts. Similar to mammals, the faces of fish also convey much information, but little is known about whether fish pay attention to the face or face-viewing patterns. Here we document the face-viewing patterns of the cichlid fish Neolamprologus brichardi, which can distinguish between conspecifics based on facial colouration. First, we established a method to identify the point at which subject fish inspected. Fish often fixated in direction to their heads toward the object of attention, suggesting that the extended body axis indicated the attention point. Using this attribute, we examined the point of attention of subject fish presented with photographs of conspecifics and heterospecifics. The results revealed that the fish inspected initially and repeatedly at the face and the duration was longer for the face than other body parts.

AB  - We conducted a population genetic analysis of the two Amazonian tortoises, Chelonoidis denticulata (n = 40) and Chelonoidis carbonaria (n = 39) in a region of sympatry within the Xingu River basin. High levels of gene flow among sampled localities indicated lack of population structure for both species. Genetic parameters indicated a moderate level of genetic diversity in C. denticulata and neutrality tests suggested that populations of this species were in demographic equilibrium with respect to mitochondrial DNA. On the other hand, C. carbonaria presented low levels of genetic diversity and a signal of population expansion. Most records of C. denticulata are from areas of humid forest while those for C. carbonaria are from areas of semi-deciduous forests and transitional areas between humid and semi-deciduous forests. Therefore, the demographic expansion observed in C. carbonaria population could reflect an increase in the availability of suitable habitats for this species due to anthropogenic or natural processes. Additionally, we observed haplotype sharing between these two tortoise species indicating hybridization or incomplete lineage sorting.

AB  - Little information has been published on Peruvian chelonians. Here we have compiled the available literature pertaining to Peruvian freshwater turtles and tortoises on four topics: Human consumption and ethnobiology, habitat use, status and abundance, and reproduction. In addition, we provide a map of the regions of Peru showing the number of research records and the number of species that occur in each region. Reproduction was the topic most frequently studied, although investigations were concentrated on only three species (Podocnemis unifilis, P. expansa, P. sextuberculata). The regions where the most studies were implemented are the Departamentos de Loreto and Madre de Dios, with studies tending to be concentrated in the vicinity of Iquitos, the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve, and Manu National Park and its buffer zone. In general, regions in which more research effort was evident reported more turtle species, which suggests that the least- studied states could have more species, as they share the same types of habitats as the more intensely investigated regions. We identified major gaps in information and suggest future research in the following poorly studied Peruvian regions: Departaments of Junin, San Martin, Tumbes, Huanuco, Amazonas, Cusco, Ayacucho, Puno, Huancavelica, and Cajamarca. The status, distribution, and abundance of Peruvian populations of Podocnemis expansa, P. unifilis, Chelonoidis carbonaria, Peltocephalus dumerilianus, and Mesoclemmys heliostemma are in particular need of study. Conservation priorities are also discussed.

AB  - THE St. Petersburg Correspondent of the Times writes as follows:—The question of the existence of volcanoes in Central Asia, especially on the Kuldja frontier, has always been a matter of doubt and discussion among geologists and Russian explorers. The Governor of Semiretchinsk, Gen. Kolpakofsky, had already fitted out expeditions to settle the question—once in 1878, and again in 1879; but owing to the difficulties of reaching the mountains, which the Chinese consider impassable, and also to the disorders which were then taking place in Kashgar, both expeditions were unsuccessful. This year General Kolpakofsky again set himself to the task, and now reports that he has at last discovered the perpetual fires in the Thian Shan range of mountains. He telegraphs that the mountain Bai Shan has been found twelve miles north east of the City of Kuldja, in a basin surrounded by the massive Ailak Mountains, and that the fires which have been burning there from time immemorial are not volcanic, but proceed from burning coal. On the sides of the mountain there are caves emitting smoke and sulphurous gas. The Official Messenger, referring to this interesting telegram, observes that the question as to the existence of volcanic formations in Central Asia, which has so long agitated the learned world, is now irrevocably decided in the negative, and bears the testimony of many Russian explorers. Mr. Schuyler also, in his “Turkistan,” mentions that these perpetual fires in the mountains referred to by Chinese historians were considered by Severtzoff, who explored the region, as being caused by the ignition of the seams of coal or the carburetted hydrogen gas in the seams. The same author further mentions that Capt. Tosnofskey, another Russian explorer, was told of a place in the neighbourhood from which steam constantly rose, and that near this crevice there had existed from ancient times three pits, where persons afflicted with rheumatism or skin diseases were in the habit of bathing.

AB  - Sociality is a fundamental organizing principle across taxa, thought to come with a suite of adaptive benefits. However, making causal inferences about these adaptive benefits requires experimental manipulation of the social environment, which is rarely feasible in the field. Here we manipulated the number of conspecifics in Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) in the wild, and quantified how this affected a key benefit of sociality, social foraging, by investigating several components of foraging success. As adaptive benefits of social foraging may differ between sexes, we studied males and females separately, expecting females, the more social and risk-averse sex in guppies, to benefit more from conspecifics. Conducting over 1600 foraging trials, we found that in both sexes, increasing the number of conspecifics led to faster detection of novel food patches and a higher probability of feeding following detection of the patch, resulting in greater individual resource consumption. The extent of the latter relationship differed between the sexes, with males unexpectedly exhibiting a stronger social benefit. Our study provides rare causal evidence for the adaptive benefits of social foraging in the wild, and highlights that sex differences in sociality do not necessarily imply an unequal ability to profit from the presence of others. Snijders et al. present a field-based experimental study of the effects of group size and sex composition on social foraging in Trinidadian guppies. Their results indicate that sex differences in sociality do not necessarily imply an unequal ability to benefit from social presence.

AB  - In free-ranging reptile populations, bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic pathogens may affect hosts through impairment in movements, thermoregulation, reproduction, survival, and population dynamics. The speckled dwarf tortoise (Chersobius [Homopus] signatus) is a threatened species that is mostly restricted to the Succulent Karoo biome in South Africa, and little information on pathogens of this species is available yet. We derived baseline parameters for five males and five females that were captured to genetically enhance a conservation breeding program in Europe. Upon collection of the tortoises, ticks were removed and identified. Immediately upon arrival in Europe, ocular, nasal, oral and cloacal swabs were taken for viral, bacteriological and mycological examinations. Fecal samples were collected before and 1 month after fenbendazole treatment, and analyzed for parasites. A panel of PCR, aiming to detect herpesviruses, adenoviruses and iridoviruses, was carried out. Samples were negative for viruses, while bacteriological examination yielded detectable growth in 82.5% of the swabs with a mean load of 16 × 107 ± 61 × 108 colony forming units (CFU) per swab, representing 34 bacterial species. Cloacal and oral swabs yielded higher detectable growth loads than nasal and ocular swabs, but no differences between sexes were observed. Fungi and yeasts (mean load 5 × 103 ± 13 × 103 CFU/swab) were detected in 25% of the swabs. All pre-treatment fecal samples were positive for oxyurid eggs, ranging from 200 to 2400 eggs per gram of feces, whereas after the treatment a significantly reduced egg count (90–100% reduction) was found in seven out of 10 individuals. One remaining individual showed 29% reduction, and two others had increased egg counts. In five tortoises, Nycthocterus spp. and coccidian oocysts were also identified. Soft ticks were identified as Ornithodoros savignyi. Our baseline data from clinically healthy individuals will help future studies to interpret prevalences of microorganisms in speckled dwarf tortoise populations. The study population did not appear immediately threatened by current parasite presence.

AB  - Background
Salmonella spp. and oxyurids are among the most prevalent bacterial and parasitic agents in reptiles. These organisms are routinely isolated in healthy tortoises, although heavy infections may cause significant pathology. Tortoises are considered a common source of reptile-associated salmonellosis, an important zoonosis reported worldwide. A survey of the prevalence of Salmonella spp. and oxyurids in 53 tortoises was conducted in southern Italy and a possible correlation between the two pathogens was therefore investigated.

AB  - We examined the type material of the extinct tortoise species Geochelone atlantica Lopez-Jurado, Mateo and Garcia-Marquez, 1998 from Sal Island, Cape Verde, using aDNA approaches and AMS radiocarbon dating. High-quality mitochondrial genomes obtained from the three type specimens support that all type material belongs to the same individual. In phylogenetic analyses using mitochondrial genomes of all species groups and genera of extant and some recently extinct tortoises, the type material clusters within the extant South American red-footed tortoise Chelonoidis carbonarius (Spix, 1824). Our radiocarbon date indicates that the tortoise from which the type series of G. atlantica originates was still alive during 1962 and 1974. These results provide firm evidence that the type material of G. atlantica does not belong to the Quaternary tortoise bones excavated on Sal Island in the 1930s, as originally thought. Thus, the extinct tortoise species remains unstudied and lacks a scientific name, and the name G. atlantica has to be relegated into the synonymy of C. carbonarius. The circumstances that led to this confusion currently cannot be disentangled.

AB  - <b><i>Background:</i></b> The growing contact between men and wild animals, caused by the increase in the population in urban centers and the destruction of the habitat of these animals, has been leading to a greater circulation of pathogens between humans and wildlife. <i>Chelonoidis carbonaria</i>, a tortoise found throughout South America, is one of the animals most rescued from animal trafficking and illegal breeding. Considering this situation, this study aimed to verify the occurrence of hemoparasites in <i>C. carbonaria</i>. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> Blood samples from 73 <i>C. carbonaria</i> were collected from animals located in (1) a rural commercial breeding unit, (2) an urban zoo, and (3) a center of rescued animal screening. Genomic DNA was extracted from these animals and used in PCRs to detect specific genomic fragments of haemogregarines (<i>i.e.</i>, <i>Hepatozoon</i> and <i>Hemolivia</i>), and members of the Anaplasmataceae Family (<i>i.e.</i>, <i>Ehrlichia</i> sp. and <i>Anaplasma</i> sp.). Blood samples were screened for hemopathogens by direct microscopy and were used for hematological assays, and serum samples were analyzed to determine the concentration of serum components. <b><i>Results:</i></b> It was found that 34.2% of the tortoises presented <i>Sauroplasma</i> sp. in their blood samples; these animals showed clinical biochemistry changes that indicate altered liver function. Two zoo animals were positive for <i>Ehrlichia</i> sp. in PCR, and also presented clinical biochemistry and hematological changes. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> The present project is pioneer in the detection of <i>Ehrlichia</i> sp. in <i>C. carbonaria</i>, and was able to identify changes in clinical biochemistry that can be a result of the infection by hemopathogens in this species.

AB  - Seed dispersal by endozoochory is important for the maintenance of plant
populations and biodiversity. As a result, understanding the impact that
frugivores’ activities have on seed dispersal is essential in order to better
understand plant population dynamics. One factor that is known to affect an
animal’s behaviour, yet has received little attention in this context, is animal
cognition i.e. whether the information animals learn and remember affects where
they access fruit and deposit seeds. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to
address how animal learning and memory affects the seed dispersal process, using
two key approaches – experimental tests of frugivore cognition, and a model
paramaterised to examine the consequences of different cognitive abilities on seed
dispersal. Three questions were investigated:
(1) The “where?” - whether the ability of frugivores to relocate previously
visited food sources impacts upon their movements and, as a consequence, on
plants’ seed shadows. The spatial learning and memory of red-footed tortoises
was tested using an egocentric task. Tortoises were able to navigate efficiently in
the environment, and remembered the spatial location of food for at least two
months. A seed dispersal model designed to test whether frugivores with different
spatial memory skills differently affect plants’ seed shadow, suggested that
animals with long spatial memory relocate more efficiently food sources than
animals’ with shorter memory. As a consequence, animals with longer memory
survived longer, dispersed a bigger amount of seeds, and moved less at random
around the environment, all of which lead to different spatial distribution of
deposited seeds.
(2) The “What?” - whether seed dispersers’ discriminatory skills and
memory affects their choice of fruit. Tortoises’ ability to discriminate between
quantity and quality of food was tested. They were able to successfully
discriminate between the visual cues indicating different types of food and
remembered the task for at least 18 months. A seed dispersal model designed to 
II
investigate whether the memory of quality and quantity of food affects seed
dispersal showed that the ability to discriminate between the features of fruits and,
in particular, the memory of those, allows animals to base their foraging decision
on previous learned experiences, significantly increasing the amount of seed
dispersed from the preferred fruit.
(3) The “When?” - whether the ability to anticipate events, such as food
availability, and learn about plants fruiting cycles affects plants’ seed shadows.
Tortoises’ anticipatory skills were tested on a 24 h cycle. They were able to
anticipate food delivery, showing an increase in activity immediately prior the
scheduled food delivery time. A seed dispersal model designed to test the impact
of timing on dispersal showed that animals that are able to anticipate cycles equal
to or longer than plants’ fruiting cycle readily relocate food, survive longer and
disperse more seeds than those with memory that doesn’t last as long as a fruiting
cycle.
Finally, I present a model parameterised with red-footed tortoise cognitive
data, with the aim to test one of the characteristics that makes tortoises unusual as
seed dispersal vectors: the use of gaps in the forest. The results suggest that the
active use of gaps enhances the probability of seed deposition in gaps and
deforested areas, making tortoises a possible reforestation “tool”.
I have demonstrated that the study of frugivores’ cognition can help to
build more reliable predictions of seed dispersal by endozoochory: cognition is
probably the most effective way to understand and predict an animal’s choices
and movements around the environment. Future research should incorporate
cognition in the study seed dispersal via endozoochory to have more reliable
predictions of plant dynamics.

AB  - The importance of calcium and phosphorus for the health of reptiles is well known. Proper calcium intake is critical for the prevention of nutritional diseases such as nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism (NSHP); however, the role magnesium may play in this disease is unknown. Magnesium is the second most abundant intracellular cation in the body and has influence on the function of vitamin D and parathyroid hormone. Chelonians are one of the most common companion reptile groups presenting for NSHP. The purpose of this study was to establish reference intervals for complete blood counts, total calcium, total magnesium, and phosphorus. Peripheral blood was collected in November in the northern hemisphere on a single day from 40 captive red-footed tortoises (Chelonoidis carbonaria). Hematologic and biochemistry assessment included packed cell volume, a blood smear for white blood cell slide estimate and differential count, and plasma concentrations of total calcium, total magnesium, and phosphorus. There was no correlation between total calcium and total magnesium. This population of red-footed tortoises appeared to be predominantly lymphocytic in the season in which samples were collected, and may have also had an absolute basophilia. This is the first study to determine reference intervals for complete blood counts and select biochemistry parameters of a uniform cohort of red-footed tortoises. These values may aid in clinical management and monitoring of red-footed tortoises presenting for veterinary care.

AB  - ABSTRACT We studied changes in a population of red-footed Amazonian tortoises, Geochelone carbonaria , consequent to isolationin an insular forest fragment. Altered age structure, population density, and body growth rate are shown here for theﬁrst time to be associated responses. Age structure was strongly biased toward juveniles and growth rates were reducedcompared to the mainland.

AB  - Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) have been reported as causes of morbidity and mortality in free-living animal populations, including turtles and tortoises, and they have even resulted in species extinctions, with human activities contributing to the spread of many of these diseases. In the Galapagos, giant tortoises are endangered due to habitat change, invasive species, and other human impacts; however, the impact of EIDs on Galapagos tortoise conservation remains understudied. To fulfil this gap, we conducted health assessments of five tortoise species from the islands of Santa Cruz, Isabela, and Espanola. We performed health evaluations of 454 animals and PCR testing for pathogens known to be relevant in other tortoise species. We identified two novel sequences of adenoviruses and four of herpesviruses. Based on alignments of the DNA polymerase gene and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses, we found both novel adenoviruses to be most closely related to red footed tortoise adenovirus 2 by nucleotide sequence and red footed tortoise adenovirus 1 based on amino acid sequence. Three of the herpesvirus sequences translated into the same deduced amino acid sequence; therefore, they may be considered the same viral species, closely related to terrapene herpesvirus 2. The fourth herpesvirus sequence was highly divergent from any sequence previously detected and is related to an eagle owl herpesvirus based on nucleotide sequence and to loggerhead oro-cutaneous herpesvirus based on amino acids. These novel viruses seem to be pathogenic for giant tortoises under specific conditions (e.g., stress). Continued screening is crucial to determine if these viruses play a role in tortoise fitness, morbidity, and survival. This information allows us to provide recommendations to the Galapagos National Park Directorate and other institutions to improve the management of these unique species both in Galapagos and globally, and for tortoise reintroduction plans throughout the archipelago.

AB  - Trafficking is one of the illicit activities with the greatest impact on wildlife populations. The extraction of animals from their natural habitat causes a decrease in their populations, affecting a species to such an extent that in some cases it may lead to extinction.
This study sought to contribute to the knowledge of the different species used as pets in Pereira, Risaralda, since, as evidenced by the National Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Illegal Traffic of Wild Species, it is characterised as one of the cities with the greatest number of seizures of trafficked wildlife nationwide due to high demand. 96 interviews were conducted with the Regional Autonomous Corporation of Risaralda (CARDER) and with people from the centre of Pereira, in order to determine which species are the most used as pets and the areas with the highest traffic in the city. For both cases, both in the database and in the surveys put to the community, the taxonomic group with the greatest demand is that of birds, followed by reptiles and mammals. The Yellow-crowned Amazon (Amazona ochrocephala), Morrocoy Turtle (Chelonoidis carbonaria) and the White-fronted Capuchin (Cebus albifrons) are the species with the highest demand for pets according to the animals that arrive at the refuge due to seizures or community members handing the animals in. As for the places with the highest traffic in Pereira, there is no clear zoning, since this activity takes place throughout the city.

AB  - The discriminative potentials of biogeography, vocalization, morphology, cytogenetics, hemoglobin, and molecular profiling of cytochrome b as taxonomic techniques for differentiating Brazilian tortoises were evaluated in this study. In Brazil, two species of tortoises are described, Chelonoidis carbonarius and Chelonoidis denticulatus. However, in the present study, some animals that were initially recognized based on morphological characters and coloring did not correspond to the typical pattern of C. carbonarius; these animals were classified as morphotypes 1 and 2. It was proposed that these morphotypes are differentiated species, and they should not be considered as a single taxonomic unit with C. carbonarius. Tortoises analyzed were provided by the National Institute for Amazonian Research (INPA); the Emilio Goeldi Museum, PA; municipal zoos in Sao Jose do Rio Preto, SP, and Aracatuba, SP; and the Reginaldo Uvo Leone breeding farm for Wild and Exotic Animals, Tabapua, SP. Based on the data obtained using biogeographic evaluation of specimens in the literature, it was found that C. carbonarius is distributed in the Northeast Region of Brazil, and no animal of this pattern was observed in the investigated collections. On the other hand, C. denticulatus is found in all the states of the Legal Amazonia. In addition, isolated individual records of this species exist in the Atlantic Forest in Espirito Santo and Rio de Janeiro and in the Midwest Region composed of the states of Goias, Mato Grosso, and Mato Grosso do Sul. In the Northeast Region, C. denticulatus occurs in the State of Bahia. Morphotype 1 has a wider geographical distribution than C. carbonarius, possibly because of several distribution reports associated with C. carbonarius, indicating erroneous association of morphotype 1 as a single taxonomic unit with C. carbonarius. Morphotype 2 is found only in the states of Para, Maranhao, and Piaui. These biogeographic data indicate that the distribution of C. carbonarius can partially be explained by the fact that all the morphotypes are considered as a single taxonomic unit. Behavioral aspects such as intraspecific communication may be as reliable as morphological or molecular data for inferring evolutionary relationships. Analysis of the physical characteristics of vocalization [fundamental frequency (Hz), interval between notes (s), duration of each note (s), and number of notes from each vocalization] between C. carbonarius and morphotype 1 revealed statistically significant differences in the interval between notes (s) (P = 0.0000); duration of each note (s) (P = 0.0000); frequency of notes (Hz) (P = 0.0009); and number of notes (P = 0.0002). The results of preference experiments using sound stimulus were inconclusive with respect to species-specific vocalization preference; only females of C. carbonarius showed intraspecific vocalization preference, indicating possible reproductive isolation mechanisms. To explore the presence of sexual dimorphism and morphological differences between C. denticulatus, C. carbonarius, and morphotype 1, descriptive statistics to analyze the data obtained for the investigated measures were used. Two sets of analysis were conducted - the first for each group, to compare the sexes; and the second for each sex, to compare the groups. To examine the interspecific variation in size and shape, a correlation matrix inprincipal component analysis was used. Next, I used factor analysis to rank the features showing >0.75 correlation in the differentiation between the sexes. The results were consistent with the hypothesis that morphotype 1 corresponds to a new species, because it differs from the species pattern in terms of morphology, coloring, and sexual dimorphism. The results of classical cytogenetic analysis - to differentiate C. denticulatus, C. carbonarius, and morphotype 1 - revealed no consistent data that would enable its use as a taxonomic parameter. Conventional Giemsa staining revealed a diploid chromosome number of 2n = 52 for all the evaluated groups. The patterns obtained using chromosomal banding techniques showed high similarity and low reproducibility. Moreover, the sensitivity and resolution were insufficient to enable differentiation between the three groups, implying the existence of conserved characteristics of the karyotype in Testudinidae. To establish a hemoglobin profile for C. denticulatus, C. carbonarius, and morphotype 1, and to visualize the hemoglobin fractions of each group, I conducted acid and alkaline electrophoreses. The results of high-performance liquid chromatography revealed percentage differences in the hemoglobin fractions. In addition, electrophoresis of the polypeptide chains under acid and alkaline pH conditions showed the globin composition of each fraction. The observed differences in the chromatographic profile between C. carbonarius and morphotype 1 with respect to C. denticulatus validated the technique as an additional method for elucidating taxonomic issues in Testudinidae. The similarities observed in the hemoglobin profiles of C. carbonarius and morphotype 1 suggest recent separation between these groups. Alignment of mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b fragments revealed a degree of homogeneity among the C. denticulatus samples and the sequences published in the literature, indicating low genetic variability of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b fragment for this species. In contrast, the sequences of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b fragments from C. carbonarius and morphotypes 1 and 2 differed from those available in the published literature databases, indicating a variable genetic structure. This may be because it does not consider taxonomic divisions within C. carbonarius. Phylogenetic analysis did not reveal an appropriate phylogenetic signal for differentiating C. carbonarius and morphotypes 1 and 2. However, this analysis did differentiate C. denticulatus, indicating that the separation of C. carbonarius and morphotypes 1 and 2 is more recent than the separation of C. denticulatus and C. carbonarius. Owing to the problems associated with the use of cytochrome b in phylogenetic analysis, the polytomy observed for C. carbonarius and morphotypes 1 and 2 does not exclude the hypothesis that these samples represent different species. It is possible that the inclusion of morphological, behavioral, and hemoglobin profile data in a mixed matrix with the molecular data would enable the separation of morphotypes 1 and 2 as monophyletic species. This analysis would require data regarding external groups, to facilitate a more robust phylogenetic analysis, thereby enabling greater taxonomic resolution. In view of the differences in the biogeographical pattern, vocalization, specific-sound preference, and morphology found in the present study, I propose that morphotype 1 should be considered a new species. Data regarding the conservation status of natural tortoise populations in Brazil should be reviewed, because of the intensive human pressure on this species. There are no private or public plans for the conservation or recovery of natural tortoise populations. Hence, it is very likely that these animals have a more endangered status than that reported in the literature.

AB  - We investigated Salmonella sp. in red-foot tortoise (Chelonoides carbonaria) because of the fact this particular reptile shows high frequency of illegal commerce, and also because this situation represents a serious risk for health. We collected feces of 89 turtles from the wildlife center “Chico Mendes” - IBAMA/SUPES-BA. Characteristic colonies of Salmonella sp. were isolated in 12.36% of the tortoises (11/89). Nine colonies were identificated at the Adolfo Lutz Institute, distributed into six different sorotypes: S. enterica salamae 47:b:-; S. enterica houtenae 21:g,z51; S. Panama; S. Poona; S. Javiana e S. Michigan. All of them, according to literature, without previous description of infection in C. carbonaria whatsoever. However, there are previous cases of infections and antibiotics resistance involving these sorotypes, confirming the risk represented by wildlife trade to public health concerning the children’s exposition to the source of infection as well as the dissemination of resistant sorotypes.

AB  - We present 10 nearly complete mitochondrial genomes of the extinct tortoise Chelonoidis alburyorum from the Bahamas. While our samples represent morphologically distinct populations from six islands, their genetic divergences were shallow and resembled those among Galapagos tortoises. Our molecular clock estimates revealed that divergence among Bahamian tortoises began ~ 1.5 mya, whereas divergence among the Galapagos tortoises (C. niger complex) began ~ 2 mya. The inter-island divergences of tortoises from within the Bahamas and within the Galapagos Islands are much younger (0.09–0.59 mya, and 0.08–1.43 mya, respectively) than the genetic differentiation between any other congeneric pair of tortoise species. The shallow mitochondrial divergences of the two radiations on the Bahamas and the Galapagos Islands suggest that each archipelago sustained only one species of tortoise, and that the taxa currently regarded as distinct species in the Galapagos should be returned to subspecies status. The extinct tortoises from the Bahamas have two well-supported clades: the first includes one sample from Great Abaco and two from Crooked Island; the second clade includes tortoises from Great Abaco, Eleuthera, Crooked Island, Mayaguana, Middle Caicos, and Grand Turk. Tortoises belonging to both clades on Great Abaco and Crooked Island suggest late Holocene inter-island transport by prehistoric humans.

AB  - Island ecosystems are highly sensitive to the impacts of introduced species. Non-native invasive snakes, lizards, and amphibians can introduce diseases into native populations and have other deleterious effects through predation, competition, and habitat manipulation. The United States (US) Virgin Islands are situated on the Puerto Rican Shelf in the Caribbean Sea and have a long history of human impacts and species introductions. Two species, the green iguana (Iguana iguana) and the red-legged tortoise (Geochelone carbonaria) were historically introduced and have become naturalized with little apparent impact to the local ecosystem. Recent years, however, have seen the introduction of several highly invasive species that have proved to have severe impacts when introduced elsewhere, specifically the Cuban treefrog (Osteopilus septentrionalis), cane toad (Bufo marinus), and the red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta). The distribution of non-native herpetofauna has been documented on all main islands of the US Virgin Islands and potential routes for introduction and dispersal have been identified. Additional species are still being identified, having arrived via cargo shipments from other Caribbean ports.

AB  - Wide-ranging species are seldom considered conservation priorities, yet they have the potential to harbour genetically deeply differentiated units across environments or ecological barriers, including some that warrant taxonomic recognition. Documenting such cryptic genetic diversity is especially important for wide-ranging species that are in decline, as they may comprise a set of even more endangered lineages or species with small distributions. However, studies of wide-ranging species, particularly when they cross political borders, are extremely challenging. One approach to overcoming these challenges is to conduct detailed local analyses in combination with less detailed, range-wide studies. We used this approach with the red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonarius), a threatened species likely to contain cryptic diversity given its vast range and the distinctive ecoregions that it inhabits. Previous single-gene molecular studies indicated the presence of at least five lineages, two of which occur in different ecoregions separated by the Andes within Colombia. We used a comprehensive genomic analysis to test the hypothesis of cryptic diversity within the single jurisdiction of Colombia. We used a combination of restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing and environmental niche modelling to provide three independent lines of evidence that support the presence of important cryptic diversity that may deserve taxonomic recognition: allopatric reproductive isolation, local adaptation and ecological divergence. We also provide a fine-scale genetic map with the distribution of conservation units in Colombia. As we complete ongoing range-wide analyses and make taxonomic adjustments, we recommend that the two lineages in Colombia be treated as separate units for conservation purposes.

AB  - Chelonians, an order of the class Reptilia are mostly long lived animals with relatively small capacity for rapid population growth (POUGH; HEISER; MCFARLAND, 1999). The most widely distributed genus is the Chelonoidis, which comprises 22 species found in South America, Africa, Asia and the Oceanic Islands. In Brazil, two species of turtles come from humid forests, the Chelonoidis carbonaria and Chelonoidis denticulata. The devastation and deforestation of these forests are pointed out as one of the reasons for species of this genus to spread and even mate with each other. Hybrids may compete for resources with parental species, favored by “hybrid vigor” or, if they are fertile, have an impact on the genetic integrity of wild populations due to the potential risk of backcrossing with consequent introgression. Hybridization can pose a threat to small populations, even when the gene sets do not mix. There are records of hybrids involving species of the same suborder, with the genus Trachemys (JACKSON, 2010). In order to provide subsidies for the improvement of sustainable biological management and conservation programs as well as for future projects to be developed with chelonians, this work aimed the characterization of the karyotypes by means of conventional staining, chromosome banding and mapping of some repetitive DNAs in two Chelonoidis kept in captivity.

AB  - In the Bolivian Chaco, the tortoise Geochelone carbonaria is an important reptile to indigenous people for subsistence purposes and in traditional medicine. In Bolivia the species is considered near threatened, while observations suggest it is less abundant near communities and cattle ranches. However, understanding of its biology and ecology is limited. As part of a landscape conservation program with indigenous land and wildlife management, this article describes research on ranging patterns for the species at two long-term research camps in the Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park. The principal research method is radio-telemetry with 15 individuals over a two-year period. The tortoises occupy home ranges of 50-600 ha, with males using ranges three times larger than females. Individual home ranges overlap, up to 96% between pairs of monitored individuals, with multiple individual ranges overlapping simultaneously, while many males and females shift their ranges between wet and dry seasons. The relatively large ranges for an animal of this size in the Chaco, combined with shifting ranges across seasons, even in protected areas, means that conservation of red-footed tortoises within human-impacted landscapes will require provision of key resources that include appropriate food, water, and shelter where these become scarce. Alternatively, indigenous territories and ranches will need to set aside communal and private reserves exceeding 1,000 ha in order to maintain tortoise populations on their lands.

AB  - 6-Nitrodopamine (6-ND) is an endogenous modulator of the contractility in the rat isolated epididymal vas deferens (RIEVD) and considered to be the main peripheral mediator of the emission process. Use of selective and unselective β-adrenergic receptor antagonists has been associated with ejaculatory failure. Here, the effects of selective β<sub>1</sub>- and β<sub>1</sub>/β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor antagonists on RIEVD contractions induced by 6-ND, dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, and electric-field stimulation (EFS) were investigated. The selective β<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor antagonists atenolol (0.1 and 1 µ﻿M), betaxolol (1 µ﻿M), and metoprolol (1 µ﻿M) and the unselective β<sub>1</sub>/β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor antagonists propranolol (1 and 10 µ﻿M) and pindolol (10 µ﻿M) caused significant rightward shifts of the concentration-response curve to 6-ND (pA<sub>2</sub> 6.41, 6.91, 6.75, 6.47, and 5.74; for atenolol, betaxolol, metoprolol, propranolol, and pindolol), but had no effect on dopamine-, noradrenaline-, and adrenaline-induced contractions. The effects of selective β<sub>1</sub>- and β<sub>1</sub>/β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor antagonists at a higher concentration (atenolol 1 µ﻿M, betaxolol 1 µ﻿M, metoprolol 1 µ﻿M, propranolol 10 µ﻿M, and pindolol 10 µ﻿M) also reduced the EFS-induced RIEVD contractions in control, but not in RIEVD obtained from L-NAME-treated animals. The selective β<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist RO-363, the selective β<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol, and the selective β<sub>3</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist mirabegron, up to 300 µ﻿M, had no effect on the RIEVD tone. The results demonstrate that β<sub>1</sub>- and β<sub>1</sub>-/β<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor receptor antagonists act as 6-ND receptor antagonists in RIEVD, further confirming the main role of 6-ND in the RIEVD contractility.
