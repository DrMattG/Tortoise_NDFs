AB  - A series of 36 specimens of Geochelone carbonaria from the provinces of Darien and San Blas, Panama, definitely establishes the occurrence of that species in Panama. A population on Isla Pinos (San Blas group) may or may not be natural. The closely related species G. denticulata does not occur in Panama and seems not to occur west of the Cordillera Oriental of Colombia. Geochelone carbonaria prefers a dense forest habitat; although the species is hunted for food, it seems to survive in areas of human population. A detailed description of color, includingf ontogenetic changes, is given. Sexual maturity is attained probably at lengths of 200 to 250 mm. Clutch size is estimated to be 8 to 13 eggs, and length of hatchlings is estimated to be 53 mm. Variation is discussed in some detail, especially for characters which are used to diagnose the species G. carbonaria and G. denticulata. Sexual dimorphism is most evident in shape of shell; old individuals of both sexes have shells which are indented below and constricted about the middle, but the condition is more extreme in males. Shape of shell and head scalation are shown in diagrams. Williams (1960:120) has demonstrated, that two species of tortoises (Geochelone denticulata and G. carbonaria) inhabit northern South America. The two species resemble each other closely and are probably closely related. According to Williams (1960:2), they can be taxonomically separated with ease by using a series of characteristics (shape and texture of shell, color, and scutellation). Using these characteristics, I have found populations of Geochelone in Panama to be clearly referable to carbonaria. The following remarks, based on a total of 38 specimens (including a series of 35 from a small geographic area), provide new information on G. carbonaria at or near the extreme northwestern limit of its geographic range.

AB  - Tortoises (Testudinidae) occur in a wide range of environments, providing important ecosystem functions, such as seed dispersal and refuge in the form of burrows. Tortoise movement has previously been shown to be related to resource availability, reproductive status and local environmental conditions. However, understanding of the variables that drive their movement remains comparatively low. We investigated aspects of movement in leopard tortoises Stigmochelys pardalis—the largest and most abundant tortoise species in sub-Saharan Africa—in response to environmental, climatic and individual variables in the semi-arid Karoo, South Africa. We used GPS telemetry to calculate bihourly and daily movement and used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to ascertain important predictor variables. Temperature, distance from water sources, and month were important variables for predicting both bihourly and daily movement. Our results showed that movement increased when individuals were close to known water sources, indicating that individuals close to water resources make regular long distance movements. Movement showed a positive relationship for temperature in both models, whilst rainfall was an important predictor for bihourly movement. Our results displayed aspects of seasonality, with movement highest in spring months, likely related to reproductive activities, although no sex differences were observed. We identified temporal and spatial conditions in which leopard tortoise movement increased. Our results further support the relationship between water as a resource and movement in leopard tortoises. Individuals used one of two basic movement behaviours in relation to water in this water scarce environment. Either an individual’s home range and movements included permanent water resources allowing internal water storage replenishment, or excluded these with reliance on food resources (such as grasses, forbs, and succulents) for water.

AB  - Habitat selection and extension of the area used by a given species may vary during different phases of its life and are often determined by the distribution and availability of resources throughout the landscape, such as food, breeding sites, and shelters. In this study, we assessed the influence of body size on the areas used by 21 individuals of the yellow-footed tortoises (Chelonoidis denticulatus) from January to June 2017 in a dense rain forest area in Central Amazonia. We also investigated whether individuals selected different ranges of terrain slope, elevation, areas with high food availability, or areas with treefall gaps that could be used for shelter or thermoregulation. We monitored tortoise movements using thread-bobbins, and sampled terrain characteristics, availability of potential food resources and forest gaps along the routes used by the tortoises. We also measured the same variables in plots distributed systematically throughout the study area to evaluate resource availability. Tortoises used an average area of 1.56 ha (SD = 1.51, min = 0.03, max = 6.44). The size of the area used was positively associated with the individual body size, but did not vary between sexes. Small individuals selected higher and flatter areas where the availability of fallen flowers was higher, whereas the area used by larger individuals did not differ from the natural availability of topographic traits and food in the region. Although tortoises did not select areas according to availability of tree-fall gaps, most larger tortoises were found sheltered under fallen trees (85%). Conversely, small individuals were mainly found hidden under litter (66%). Body size determined the patterns of landscape use by tortoises; larger individuals were mainly generalists, but small individuals occupied high and flat areas. The yellow-footed tortoise is endangered by hunting, illegal collection for the pet trade, habitat destruction and effects of climate change. Size-related differences in habitat selection should be taken into account in species-distribution models for the identification of suitable areas for reintroduction and the development of management plans in protected areas.

AB  - We conducted a population genetic analysis of the two Amazonian tortoises, Chelonoidis denticulata (n = 40) and Chelonoidis carbonaria (n = 39) in a region of sympatry within the Xingu River basin. High levels of gene flow among sampled localities indicated lack of population structure for both species. Genetic parameters indicated a moderate level of genetic diversity in C. denticulata and neutrality tests suggested that populations of this species were in demographic equilibrium with respect to mitochondrial DNA. On the other hand, C. carbonaria presented low levels of genetic diversity and a signal of population expansion. Most records of C. denticulata are from areas of humid forest while those for C. carbonaria are from areas of semi-deciduous forests and transitional areas between humid and semi-deciduous forests. Therefore, the demographic expansion observed in C. carbonaria population could reflect an increase in the availability of suitable habitats for this species due to anthropogenic or natural processes. Additionally, we observed haplotype sharing between these two tortoise species indicating hybridization or incomplete lineage sorting.

AB  - The lack of cost-effective methods to detect game species in tropical forests hinders reliable assessments of their population status and the planning of effective actions for their sustainable use. Tortoises are among the most hunted species in Amazonia, but present low detectability in the wild when using current scientific methods. Traditional hunters in the region use specialized methods to capture tortoises, and such knowledge could provide useful insights for improving monitoring methods and, thus, scientific research on this species. Here, we compare the capture rates and cost-effectiveness of two methods to capture the endangered yellow-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis denticulatus) in Amazonia: the conventional active search and an adaptation of pitfall traps using attractive baits employed by Indigenous and non-Indigenous people to hunt tortoises. We sampled 40 sites in upland forests and whitewater flooded forests during the dry and wet seasons in central Amazonia and captured 37 yellow-footed tortoises. The highest capture rate (0.29 tortoises/hour) was obtained using traps in upland forests, fourfold higher than by active search. Traps also presented greater cost-effectiveness than the active search (US$63 vs US$256 per captured tortoise). Our capture rate with traps was 67 times greater than those obtained using line transects in western and northern Amazonia. The success exhibited by this widespread hunting technique is a result of centuries of hunters' traditional knowledge in the Amazon. The unveiling of a cost-effective method for capturing tortoises shows the importance of exchanging traditional and scientific knowledge; efficient capturing methods favor the inclusion of the species in long-term monitoring programs and foster in situ studies that help develop strategies for its conservation.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Hunting is a vital means of obtaining animal in various human populations. Hunters rely on their knowledge of species ecology and behavior to develop and employ hunting techniques and increase their chances of success. The comparison of the hunting practices of different human societies can shed light on the sustainability of hunting and the impact it has on species' populations. In this study, we examine and compare the techniques, modalities, and baits used by urban and rural hunters in Rondônia, a state in southwestern Amazonia, Brazil. We expected that rural hunters would use these elements and have greater knowledge when compared to urban hunters. We also expect that the use of specific hunting techniques and modalities will have greater selectivity and specificity of capture for rural hunters and that this knowledge will differ between groups.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">We conducted 106 semi-structured interviews with rural and urban hunters from October 2018 to February 2020. We analyzed the data using PERMANOVA and Network analyses to compare and contrast the hunting practices of each group.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">We recorded four main hunting techniques divided into ten modalities with three techniques and seven modalities being the preferred choices among hunters. Waiting for at a Fruit Tree was cited as the primary technique employed by hunters living in urban and rural areas indicated. While the techniques and modalities were similar among hunters, the composition of species targeted and baits used differed between groups. Our network approach showed that modularity in urban areas was numerically lower than in rural areas. All species had one to more techniques associated with their capture.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Hunters living in urban and rural environments showed high similarity in their practices, probably due to sharing similar environments to hunt containing similar species, as well as targeting preferably the same species.</AbstractText>

AB  - The five extinct giant tortoises of the genus Cylindraspis belong to the most iconic species of the enigmatic fauna of the Mascarene Islands that went largely extinct after the discovery of the islands. To resolve the phylogeny and biogeography of Cylindraspis, we analysed a data set of 45 mitogenomes that includes all lineages of extant tortoises and eight near-complete sequences of all Mascarene species extracted from historic and subfossil material. Cylindraspis is an ancient lineage that diverged as early as the late Eocene. Diversification of Cylindraspis commenced in the mid-Oligocene, long before the formation of the Mascarene Islands. This rejects any notion suggesting that the group either arrived from nearby or distant continents over the course of the last millions of years or had even been translocated to the islands by humans. Instead, Cylindraspis likely originated on now submerged islands of the Reunion Hotspot and utilized these to island hop to reach the Mascarenes. The final diversification took place both before and after the arrival on the Mascarenes. With Cylindraspis a deeply divergent clade of tortoises became extinct that evolved long before the dodo or the Rodrigues solitaire, two other charismatic species of the lost Mascarene fauna.

AB  - Studies of the reproductive functional morphology of chelonians are important to understand the reproductive physiology, anatomy, and endocrinology of these species. However, data on the reproduction of this group have been difficult to obtain because of their cryptic habits and as a result the consequent inefficiency of conventional field methods in detecting individuals in the wild. In this study, we obtained reproductive organs from 347 adult female yellow-footed tortoises (Chelonoidis denticulatus), one of the most hunted and traded land vertebrates in South America, donated by local sellers in a wild meat market in the Peruvian Amazon. We described the species’ reproductive cycle and the influence of climatic factors on reproductive performance. Of the sampled females, 116 (33.4%) were gravid and 231 (66.6%) were non-gravid, including 215 vitellogenic (62.0%) and 16 non-vitellogenic (4.6%). The mean number of ovarian follicles per female declined from 28.5 (<10 mm diameter), to 7.1 follicles (20–40 mm) to 3.2 follicles> 40 mm. Gravid females had in average 3.7 shelled eggs in the oviduct, with a mean egg diameter of 53.7 mm. The estimated annual reproductive potential in gravid females was 5.1 eggs per clutch, ranging from one to 22 eggs. There was a strong positive relationship between the diameter of shelled eggs and the straight carapace length of gravid females. The final phase of the folicular growth, the most demanding energetic process in chelonian reproduction, correlated with annual rainfall peak, while oviposition was estimated to occur in the dry season. The yellow-footed tortoise should be considered an opportunistic seasonal breeder, though capable of reproducing throughout the year. Reproductive yields are linked to climatic events that influence food availability in the environment. To improve the sustainable use of this species, adult females should be harvested primarily during reproductive quiescence, from the end of the laying period in the late dry season to the mid-rainy season when large follicles appear, to avoid taking gravid females. Our results are useful not just to better understand the reproductive biology of terrestrial chelonians but can inform the conservation management of harvested species.

AB  - The Amazonian tortoise, Geochelone denticulata , has been classified as vulnerable; nevertheless, necessary ecological and demographic information to formulate conservation plans is limited. In this study we present data on population density, habitat preference, diet and morphological measurements of a population inhabiting a lowland rainforest in Colombia. We used line transect methods to estimate population density over three different years, and we measured and marked 73 individuals in two additional years. The estimated population density based on 158 encounters was similar over the three years (41 ± 20, 38 ± 6, 34 ± 8 ind/km 2 ±SE, respectively). However, we found marked differences between seasons within years, because it was easy to detect individuals (particularly males) during mating periods. There was no evidence of large scale seasonal migrations; thus, it is possible that individuals were missed in the non-reproductive season and therefore our figures may underestimate population size. For the same reason, sex ratios during the mating season may be more biased towards males than for whole year estimates (1.7:1 vs. 1.2:1). Monthly density estimates were significantly correlated with mating frequency and with estimates of fruit abundance, but were not associated with rainfall, temperature or sun radiance. These results suggest that males might use available energy from fruit to travel extensively during the mating season in search of females. However, the most productive forest type in terms of fruit was not preferred by tortoises, to the contrary, they were more commonly encountered in forests with a high proportion of gaps. Males tended to have larger and more elongated bodies than females. This result supports the hypothesis that since males must travel more in search of mates, it is an advantage for them to have an elongated carapace in order to move through dense understory. More ecological information is required from other geographical locations to establish which ecological variables are most important in determining the carrying capacity for terrestrial tortoises. So far the demographic structure of the populations suggest that predation of young individuals plays a major role.

AB  - Wild meat plays a crucial role in the food security and cash income of subsistence hunters in the tropics and subtropics in Africa, South America, and SE Asia (Coad et al., 2019; Fa et al., 2022). This meat is regularly traded in markets in many towns and cities (see Fa et al., 2019). In Nigeria, the amount of meat sold from most species crashed dramatically after the Ebola virus outbreak in 2014, highlighting the awareness of the general public of a link between disease risk and wild meat (Akani et al., 2015; Funk et al., 2021). The opportunities for zoonotic spill-over have increased in parallel with the increase of the intensity and extent of bushmeat trade over the last decades (Karesh & Noble, 2009). The report by UNEP, International Livestock Research Institute (2020) on preventing the next pandemic lists increasing human demand for animal protein among seven human-mediated factors as the most likely driving the emergence of zoonotic diseases, which includes wild meat hunting. The 2020/21 COVID-19 pandemic poignantly reminds us of the social, economic, and health consequences of zoonotic diseases (FAO, CIRAD, CIFOR, WCS, 2020). “Wet” markets selling wild meat and live wildlife are presumed to have played a crucial role in increasing the risk of spill-over events from wildlife to humans (Jones et al., 2008). While the COVID-19 virus' origin remains unknown, it is believed to have resulted from a spill-over event that may have emerged in or was amplified by a wet market in Wuhan in China's Hubei province (Lu et al., 2020). The previous 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak likely originated also in Chinese markets that also offer wildlife and/or wild meat for sale (Cui et al., 2019; Guan et al., 2003; Lu et al., 2020). In such markets, large numbers of wild and domestic animals of different taxonomic origin are regularly kept in unhygienic, crammed and stressful conditions, creating perfect storms for cross-species and zoonotic transmission, as shown in a study of SARS-CoV prevalence in civets (the most likely intermediate host) along the market chain in Guangzhou, China. Farmed civets were essentially free from SARS-CoV infection, but prevalence was ≈80% for animals sold in markets (Tu et al., 2004). Countless numbers of different mammals, reptiles, and bird species are hunted to be sold in many West and Central African countries, including Nigeria (Petrozzi et al., 2016; Taylor et al., 2015). We monitored wild meat sales of antelopes (including duikers), bush pigs, carnivores (including mongooses), fruit bats, diurnal primates, large rodents (particularly grasscutters and porcupines) and reptiles (including crocodiles, snakes, tortoises and turtles) in nine markets in southern Nigeria's Niger delta before and after COVID-19. We did not observe pangolins since these are uncommon in the delta but are more frequently sold in markets east of the delta. Our nine study markets are significant concentration points for wild meat, located along main roads and near principal rivers and urban centers. These areas are heavily populated containing hundreds of villages interspersed by patches of deltaic moist and flooded forests, as well as agricultural land (for map and more details, see Funk et al., 2021). Each market had around 20–30 counters with animal carcasses displayed for sale to customers. Wild meat trade has been traditionally an important source of food and income (Fa et al., 2006; Luiselli et al., 2013). In our study, monitoring commenced in 2010. Results up to the end of 2019 in the context of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak of 2014 are presented in Funk et al. (2021). We surveyed each market about once every 10 days almost every month from 2016 onward, but less often between 2010 and 2015. In each market, we counted the total number of carcasses displayed by sellers very early in the morning when carcasses arrived and before selling started. Carcass counts were summarized over markets for each surveyed month by calculating mean numbers of carcasses per market per day in each month. Here, we report sales volumes between January 2019 and February 2020 (the pre-COVID-19 phase) and between March and Dec 2020 (the COVID-19 phase). We compare sales for these periods with the pre-EVD period from 2010 to June 2014. COVID-19 reached Nigeria on March 2020, triggering the Presidential COVID-19 Taskforce established on March 9. A travel ban and restrictions on large gatherings ensued on March 18, and lockdowns followed on March 30. A federal total lockdown in the capital and several states was extended until the end of April. Because of public resistance as a consequence of the severe socioeconomic consequences resulting from confinement, total lockdown was eased. This was replaced by overnight curfews, obligatory wearing of facemasks and hand washing, social distancing, and avoidance of crowds recommended (Ajide et al., 2020; BBC, 2021; Dixit et al., 2020). However, various states continued to impose restrictions and lockdowns in line with the rise of COVID-19. Rivers State, where our market surveys were conducted, was the state with the fifth highest COVID case rate in Nigeria (Owhonda et al., 2020). Statewide total lockdown occurred in several occasions and nighttime curfew was in force during most of 2020, preventing or impinging upon the hunting animals and movement of hunted animals to markets. Figure 1 shows the trends of sales volumes (i.e., mean daily numbers of carcasses per market in each month) pre- and post-COVID-19 demonstrating that sale volumes decreased for all monitored taxonomic groups. Significant declining trends were observed for antelopes (Mann–Kendall statistics for changes in time series = −2.58, p = .005); bush pigs (−2.4, p = .008); fruit bats (−3.09, p = .001); diurnal primates (−4.81, p < .001); reptiles (−3.82, p < .001); and rodents (−3.27, p < .001) but not for carnivores (−1.59, p = 0.056). These declines happened even though wild meat markets had not yet fully recovered from the dramatic reduction after the EVD outbreak in 2014 (Funk et al., 2021). Comparing the mean monthly pre-EVD, pre-COVID-19, and COVID-19 periods, sale volumes revealed the lowest values for the COVID-19 period: antelopes (4.9, 1.8, 0.9); bush pigs (not monitored, 0.9, 0.6); carnivores (4.4, 2.0, 0.5); fruit bats (14.8, 0.7, 0.2); diurnal primates (2.7, 0.1, 0.0); reptiles (3.6, 2.0, 0.5); and rodents (24.2, 16.5, 8.8). With the exception of reptiles, it is unlikely that the observed decline after the outbreak of COVID-19 resulted from overexploitation rather than disease risk. First, the decline across all species coincided with the first cases of COVID-19 reported in Nigeria. Second, after the dramatic collapse of wild meat sales during the EVD outbreak in 2014, ungulates, rodents, and carnivores significantly increased up to COVID-19 (Funk et al., 2021). Sales of fruit bats and primates, the species most implicated as the potential source of EVD, remained low after EVD, but declined even further after COVID-19. Only reptiles showed a different trajectory. Reptile sales declined prior to EVD, but rebounded immediately post-EVD, indicating compensation of the reduction of mammal wild meat, likely because reptiles are not implicated in EVD transmission. However, reptile sales declined after 2017, presumably as a result of population collapse and depletion. The further decline of reptiles in 2020 during COVID-19 might have been part of the long-term population decline. Estimates of population size in the Niger Delta have demonstrated heavy depletion during the last two decades for forest tortoises (Akani et al., 2018; Luiselli et al., 2016) and a number of snake species (Reading et al., 2010). Indirect evidence for crocodiles, from structured interviews, also indicates population declines in Nigeria (Eniang et al., 2020). Wild meat sale volumes in markets may have declined because of one of several COVID-19-related reasons or a combination of these. First, many Nigerians adopted wearing of protective masks and observed social distancing immediately after the first observed cases (2020); this was despite the widespread conspiracy theories about the virus' origin and severity in Nigeria (WILDAID USA, 2021). This indicates there was a fast adoption of behavioral responses to prevent disease transmission between people by a large proportion of the population, perhaps because of prior sensitization to the risk of zoonotic diseases during EVD (Funk et al., 2021). To explore the awareness and perception of residents in Rivers State, a cross-sectional survey (n = 1294 persons) was conducted between mid-May and mid-June 2020, that is, in the early phase of the COVID outbreak in Nigeria (Owhonda et al., 2020). This study demonstrated a high awareness of disease transmission between people (87.5% of respondents affirmed that contact with infected persons can transmit the disease) and 19.4% of respondents believed that they could get infected from animals. However, only 2.8% of people stopped eating wild meat. During the later stage of COVID-19 at the end of 2020, attitudes had changed. WILDAID USA (2021) conducted a phone survey of 2000 respondents across four major Nigerian cities in late 2020, Port Harcourt in Rivers State where two of the markets surveyed by us were located in its outskirts. Against the backdrop of widespread wild meat consumption in Nigeria (71% of respondents have consumed wild meat with 45% having consumed it within the last year), the survey demonstrated changed attitudes as 27% of respondents stopped eating and 31% ate less wild meat since the COVID-19 outbreak. These numbers were higher for those Nigerians that believe that COVID-19 is caused by wild animals (31 and 35%, respectively) than those that do not believe this (21 and 25%, respectively). Similarly, after the EVD outbreak, over 80% of market visitors reported that they would not eat again bats or primates because of the perceived disease risk from these specific animal groups (Funk et al., 2021). Thus, these surveys indicate that fear of disease transmission from wild animal meat likely contributed to reduced wild meat eating after COVID-19. It also means that those who were skeptical about the link between COVID and wildlife changed their wild meat consumption behavior in large numbers (46%), possibly as a precautionary strategy because of the EVD experience or other reasons. Second, imposed travel restrictions might have impacted the number of animals available on markets by disrupting supply chains and by changed purchasing behavior. Importantly, while EVD affected taxa differently with sales of mammals decreasing and sales of reptiles, which were never linked to EVD, initially increasing, COVID-19 was linked to a reduction of sales in all observed mammal and reptile taxa. Because of the concurrent decline of all taxa in wild meat markets—whether potentially linked to COVID-19 transmission, like bats, or not, like reptiles—it is likely that COVID-19-related restrictions on movements had a strong impact on reduced market sales. In addition to directly disrupting supply chains, shifts in purchasing behavior might have occurred like in the case of Ebola in Sierra Leone. There, the mismatch between their own experiences and official guidance caused a mistrust in authorities, leading to the proliferation of informal networks of wild meat sales, thus circumnavigating official markets (Bonwitt et al., 2018). Informal networks might have been further supported by people's fears about buying in markets, which are typically very crowded and constitute ideal opportunities for COVID-19 transmission. Thus, changes in market sales can reflect changes in both supply-side and demand-side dynamics (McNamara et al., 2020). In agreement with a previous observation after the COVID-19 outbreak (Meseko et al., 2020), we observed that nearly all typical wild meat types were still traded after the COVID-19 outbreak phase although primates disappeared completely. However, the presence of wild meat markets during the COVID-19 period does not necessarily point to a “thriving” business, as Meseko et al.'s (2020) isolated post-outbreak observations appeared to show without the benefit of long-term monitoring data, but a business that has been declining over time. Thus, investigations of wild meat traded during an epidemic without the benefit of long-term monitoring can result in biased interpretations of data. As shown in this study, long-term monitoring of wild meat trade is extremely important for the interpretation of ecological data when future epidemics occur. Given the decline of wild meat sold in southern Nigerian markets caused by two zoonotic diseases, educating consumers about disease risks in these circumstances can be vital to better influence their attitudes toward wild meat consumption (Funk et al., 2021). The decline was particularly strong among young and urban people, confirming the trend observed in West African cities which observed that younger people are particularly opposed in eating wild meat compared to older people independent of gender and country (Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Nigeria, and Togo; Luiselli et al., 2018). Similarly, more young and urban people stopped eating wild meat after the Ebola epidemic in West Africa (Funk et al., 2021). Diseases might reinforce the changing perceptions of eating habits through westernization, which regard wild meat consumption as socially unacceptable and backward (Luiselli et al., 2018). Wild meat hunting is, on the one hand, a significant threat to wildlife and ecosystems, especially when unsustainable, but can also be an irreplaceable source of income and food security for many people (Ingram et al., 2021). Balancing these aspects is not straightforward. For example, calls to cease wild meat hunting, trade and consumption after the onset of COVID-19, might in fact cause negative impacts for people and ecosystems (Booth et al., 2021). Prohibition of use of wild meat could lead to food insecurity as well as to the conversion of ecosystems to agricultural land to produce alternative protein resources, causing further biodiversity loss and even increase emerging infectious disease risk (Booth et al., 2021; Borzée et al., 2020; Fa et al., 2021). Education of all stakeholders including conservationists, anthropologists, politicians, policymakers, and hunters of the complex interrelationship between wild meat, zoonotic diseases, conservation, and human food security is essential to find the optimal balance between biodiversity conservation and human needs. The lesson from the consumer behavior visiting Nigerian markets is that policymakers should recognize that there is now an opportunity to control wild meat sales and consumption for the benefit of human health and biodiversity conservation of (Fa et al., 2022). This can include additional awareness building through education campaigns. Such initiatives can be accompanied by other suitable intervention practices such as health controls in wild meat markets.

AB  - Abstract Wildlife exploitation has nutritional, medicinal, luxury, sociocultural, and financial significance for human societies. Yet, it also risks undesired outcomes for conservation, animal welfare, and public health. Although it is prohibited in urban markets, the wildlife trade in Peru is poorly monitored, and practiced openly. To identify those species most likely to be affected, we investigated the trade in live wild animals and their derivatives at the Belen Market, and additional smaller open-air markets, which together make Iquitos the largest and most important wildlife trade hubs in the Peruvian Amazon. Specifically, we asked what wild animals or animal products were most profitable, what were they used for, and which wild animals were perceived by vendors to have increased most in rarity. Vendors provided 44 local animal names, from which we inferred an estimated 205 species. Nine per cent (n = 19) of these inferred species are categorised on the IUCN Red List as threatened; 35% (n = 71) are categorised as declining. We found that wild meat/food was the most frequently stated purpose of sale of wildlife, followed by pets, spiritual/belief-based use, traditional medicine, and decorative use. The most commonly cited most profitable wildlife derivatives were ‘lowland paca’, ‘yellow footed tortoise’, and ‘collared peccary’. A significant positive correlation was found between the most profitable species and those that are becoming increasingly rare. Further research focused on the actual impacts on wildlife, the socio-economic importance of this trade, the societal pressures driving consumer demand, and the risks to public health is warranted.

AB  - The IUCN Red List for Threaten Species is widely regarded as the authority for assessing a particular species conservation risk. However, this process has come under some criticism for designating species as high conservation risk on a precautionary principle, using limited data, grey literature or anecdotal information. The Madagascar spider tortoise (Pyxis arachnoides) is one such species, up-listed from Vulnerable to Critically Endangered status, based on data of limited spatial resolution and anecdotal information, suggesting risk from poaching and habitat loss, resulting in significant reduction in population size, thus allowing the criteria of Critically Endangered to be met (A4cd; E). This study assesses these risks to the species at a range wide level, using presence/absence surveying and incorporating data into a geographical information system to describe distribution contraction within differing areas of land use. This was coupled with a line transect distance sampling procedure to assess real time population size within the current area of occupancy. A Mark-Capture-Recapture, Cormack-Jolly-Seber model and a stage class, projection matrix was developed to model mean annual survival, finite growth rate and population survival. Finally, remotely sensed habitat loss was monitored within the core of the species range. These data suggest that the species has suffered a reduction of 70. 8% from suspected historical extent of occurrence to the current area of occupancy, now inhabiting a total area of 2,463.8 km2, with 73.5% of the current distribution occurring within existing or proposed protected areas. Range wide population density equals 226.9 (95% Cl 168.1-306.3) tortoises km-2, with a total global population estimate of 664,980 (95% Cl. 492,680-897,550). Adult mean annual survival is 0.82 (SE± 0.15), however juvenile survival cannot be modelled due to low recapture. There is an actual mean population decline of 1 0.8%, coupled with mean forest loss of 1.2% yr-1 (2003-2011), within the core of the range. The projection matrix model reveals finite population growth to be λ=0.983, indicative of a c. 1.4% decline annually, with adult survival the most sensitive parmeter to population survival. 'Projection modelling suggests the species will probably become ecologically non-viable in approximately 170 years. Results confirm the species IUCN Critically Endangered status. Development programs 'and tighter protected area management are required to address the poverty induced drivers threatening this species. This assessment provides an ideal model for similar dry forest tortoise species suffering status data deficiency. The author proposes a temporary five year condition to be placed on the designation of species considered to be of high conservation concern, similar to this species, up-listed on the Red List using anecdotal information or grey literature, whilst funds are secured and empirical peer reviewed data is obtained to confirm the status in the wild.

AB  - The discriminative potentials of biogeography, vocalization, morphology, cytogenetics, hemoglobin, and molecular profiling of cytochrome b as taxonomic techniques for differentiating Brazilian tortoises were evaluated in this study. In Brazil, two species of tortoises are described, Chelonoidis carbonarius and Chelonoidis denticulatus. However, in the present study, some animals that were initially recognized based on morphological characters and coloring did not correspond to the typical pattern of C. carbonarius; these animals were classified as morphotypes 1 and 2. It was proposed that these morphotypes are differentiated species, and they should not be considered as a single taxonomic unit with C. carbonarius. Tortoises analyzed were provided by the National Institute for Amazonian Research (INPA); the Emilio Goeldi Museum, PA; municipal zoos in Sao Jose do Rio Preto, SP, and Aracatuba, SP; and the Reginaldo Uvo Leone breeding farm for Wild and Exotic Animals, Tabapua, SP. Based on the data obtained using biogeographic evaluation of specimens in the literature, it was found that C. carbonarius is distributed in the Northeast Region of Brazil, and no animal of this pattern was observed in the investigated collections. On the other hand, C. denticulatus is found in all the states of the Legal Amazonia. In addition, isolated individual records of this species exist in the Atlantic Forest in Espirito Santo and Rio de Janeiro and in the Midwest Region composed of the states of Goias, Mato Grosso, and Mato Grosso do Sul. In the Northeast Region, C. denticulatus occurs in the State of Bahia. Morphotype 1 has a wider geographical distribution than C. carbonarius, possibly because of several distribution reports associated with C. carbonarius, indicating erroneous association of morphotype 1 as a single taxonomic unit with C. carbonarius. Morphotype 2 is found only in the states of Para, Maranhao, and Piaui. These biogeographic data indicate that the distribution of C. carbonarius can partially be explained by the fact that all the morphotypes are considered as a single taxonomic unit. Behavioral aspects such as intraspecific communication may be as reliable as morphological or molecular data for inferring evolutionary relationships. Analysis of the physical characteristics of vocalization [fundamental frequency (Hz), interval between notes (s), duration of each note (s), and number of notes from each vocalization] between C. carbonarius and morphotype 1 revealed statistically significant differences in the interval between notes (s) (P = 0.0000); duration of each note (s) (P = 0.0000); frequency of notes (Hz) (P = 0.0009); and number of notes (P = 0.0002). The results of preference experiments using sound stimulus were inconclusive with respect to species-specific vocalization preference; only females of C. carbonarius showed intraspecific vocalization preference, indicating possible reproductive isolation mechanisms. To explore the presence of sexual dimorphism and morphological differences between C. denticulatus, C. carbonarius, and morphotype 1, descriptive statistics to analyze the data obtained for the investigated measures were used. Two sets of analysis were conducted - the first for each group, to compare the sexes; and the second for each sex, to compare the groups. To examine the interspecific variation in size and shape, a correlation matrix inprincipal component analysis was used. Next, I used factor analysis to rank the features showing >0.75 correlation in the differentiation between the sexes. The results were consistent with the hypothesis that morphotype 1 corresponds to a new species, because it differs from the species pattern in terms of morphology, coloring, and sexual dimorphism. The results of classical cytogenetic analysis - to differentiate C. denticulatus, C. carbonarius, and morphotype 1 - revealed no consistent data that would enable its use as a taxonomic parameter. Conventional Giemsa staining revealed a diploid chromosome number of 2n = 52 for all the evaluated groups. The patterns obtained using chromosomal banding techniques showed high similarity and low reproducibility. Moreover, the sensitivity and resolution were insufficient to enable differentiation between the three groups, implying the existence of conserved characteristics of the karyotype in Testudinidae. To establish a hemoglobin profile for C. denticulatus, C. carbonarius, and morphotype 1, and to visualize the hemoglobin fractions of each group, I conducted acid and alkaline electrophoreses. The results of high-performance liquid chromatography revealed percentage differences in the hemoglobin fractions. In addition, electrophoresis of the polypeptide chains under acid and alkaline pH conditions showed the globin composition of each fraction. The observed differences in the chromatographic profile between C. carbonarius and morphotype 1 with respect to C. denticulatus validated the technique as an additional method for elucidating taxonomic issues in Testudinidae. The similarities observed in the hemoglobin profiles of C. carbonarius and morphotype 1 suggest recent separation between these groups. Alignment of mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b fragments revealed a degree of homogeneity among the C. denticulatus samples and the sequences published in the literature, indicating low genetic variability of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b fragment for this species. In contrast, the sequences of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b fragments from C. carbonarius and morphotypes 1 and 2 differed from those available in the published literature databases, indicating a variable genetic structure. This may be because it does not consider taxonomic divisions within C. carbonarius. Phylogenetic analysis did not reveal an appropriate phylogenetic signal for differentiating C. carbonarius and morphotypes 1 and 2. However, this analysis did differentiate C. denticulatus, indicating that the separation of C. carbonarius and morphotypes 1 and 2 is more recent than the separation of C. denticulatus and C. carbonarius. Owing to the problems associated with the use of cytochrome b in phylogenetic analysis, the polytomy observed for C. carbonarius and morphotypes 1 and 2 does not exclude the hypothesis that these samples represent different species. It is possible that the inclusion of morphological, behavioral, and hemoglobin profile data in a mixed matrix with the molecular data would enable the separation of morphotypes 1 and 2 as monophyletic species. This analysis would require data regarding external groups, to facilitate a more robust phylogenetic analysis, thereby enabling greater taxonomic resolution. In view of the differences in the biogeographical pattern, vocalization, specific-sound preference, and morphology found in the present study, I propose that morphotype 1 should be considered a new species. Data regarding the conservation status of natural tortoise populations in Brazil should be reviewed, because of the intensive human pressure on this species. There are no private or public plans for the conservation or recovery of natural tortoise populations. Hence, it is very likely that these animals have a more endangered status than that reported in the literature.

AB  - Ten species of Testudines, from four different families: Chelidae, Kinosternidae, Podocnemididae, and Testudinidae, are reported from the Tiputini Biodiversity Station (Universidad San Francisco de Quito), northeastern Amazonian Ecuador; including the second report from Ecuador of Batrachemys heliostemma. These ten species are sympatric but not completely syntopic, thus I comment on their diversity and habitat preferences patterns. The general distribution of some turtles from Amazonian Ecuador is discussed, providing additional records and distribution maps for Chelus fimbriatus, Platemys platycephala, Batrachemys heliostemma, Batrachemys raniceps, Mesoclemmys gibba, Phrynops geoffroanus, Kinosternon scorpioides, and Geochelone denticulata. The presence of Peltocephalus dumerilianus in Amazonian Ecuador is confirmed; based on re-examination of specimens previously reported by Dr. Gustavo Orces in 1949. The total Ecuadorian richness of Testudines species includes 31 living taxa, and I provide an annotated list of the turtles and tortoises of mainland and insular Ecuador. Much information is still needed in order to understand the ecological relationships of the Testudines from Ecuador and future research should focus on long-term studies designed to answer several questions about their biology and ecology. Several threats are currently jeopardizing the long-term conservation of turtle populations in Ecuador, and we must increase our knowledge on these amazing animals in order to protect and preserve them.

AB  - WHEN the late Prof, d'Arrest was called to superintend the building of the new observatory in Copenhagen and the erection of a large refractor (16 feet focal length by 11 inches aperture), he took advantage of the opportunity thus offered to enter into more extensive researches on the nebulæ, than he had been able to undertake at Leipzig. He intended at first to observe all the nebulæ which were visible in his refractor, but he soon found that a work beyond human power, and that in fact the nebulæ are infinite in number. Working hard for six years he was only able to collect the eighth part of the observations required for laying down approximate positions of all those nebulæ which are distinctly visible in the Copenhagen refractor, and whose places could be exactly determined. These observations were published as “Siderum nebulosorum observationes Havnienses,” in 1867, for which the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society was awarded to him in 1875. Prof, d'Arrest died eight years after the publication of his great work, his health broken down by constant night-watches. These years were spent mostly on spectroscopical researches, which were partly published in the Astronomische Nachrichten, partly in a separate paper, “Undersögelser over de nebulose Stjerner i Henseende til deres spectralanalytiske Egenskaber,” in 1872. This latter paper does not appear to be so widely known as it deserves, and an abstract in the columns of NATURE might therefore be acceptable to many.

AB  - We present 10 nearly complete mitochondrial genomes of the extinct tortoise Chelonoidis alburyorum from the Bahamas. While our samples represent morphologically distinct populations from six islands, their genetic divergences were shallow and resembled those among Galapagos tortoises. Our molecular clock estimates revealed that divergence among Bahamian tortoises began ~ 1.5 mya, whereas divergence among the Galapagos tortoises (C. niger complex) began ~ 2 mya. The inter-island divergences of tortoises from within the Bahamas and within the Galapagos Islands are much younger (0.09–0.59 mya, and 0.08–1.43 mya, respectively) than the genetic differentiation between any other congeneric pair of tortoise species. The shallow mitochondrial divergences of the two radiations on the Bahamas and the Galapagos Islands suggest that each archipelago sustained only one species of tortoise, and that the taxa currently regarded as distinct species in the Galapagos should be returned to subspecies status. The extinct tortoises from the Bahamas have two well-supported clades: the first includes one sample from Great Abaco and two from Crooked Island; the second clade includes tortoises from Great Abaco, Eleuthera, Crooked Island, Mayaguana, Middle Caicos, and Grand Turk. Tortoises belonging to both clades on Great Abaco and Crooked Island suggest late Holocene inter-island transport by prehistoric humans.

AB  - During a long-term study on tortoise growth within 3 fenced 9-ha enclosures in Rock Valley, Nevada Test Site (NTS), Nye County, Nevada, USA, tortoises have been captured annually since 1964 (Medica et al. 1975. Copeia 1975:630-643; Turner et al. 1987. Copeia 1987:974-979). Between early August and mid October 2003 we observed a significant mortality event. The Rock Valley enclosures were constructed of 6 x 6 mm mesh 1.2 m wide hardware cloth, buried 0.3 m in the soil with deflective flashing on both sides on the top to restrict the movement of small mammals and lizards from entering or leaving the enclosures (Rundel and Gibson 1996, Ecological communities and process in a Mojave Desert ecosystem: Rock Valley, Nevada, Cambridge University Press, Great Britain. 369 pp.). On August 6, 2003, the carcass of an adult female Desert Tortoise No.1411 (carapace length 234 mm when alive) was collected while adult male tortoise No.4414 (carapace length 269 mm) was observed alive and in good health on the same day. Subsequently the carcass of No.4414 was found on October 16, 2003. Between October 16-17, 2003, the remains of 6 (5 adult and 1 juvenile) Desert Tortoises were found, some within each of the 3more » enclosures in Rock Valley. A seventh adult tortoise was found on September 26, 2006, its death also attributed to the 2003 mortality event based upon the forensic evidence. Each of the 7 adult Desert Tortoises had the central portion of their carapace broken open approximately to the dorsal portion of the marginal scutes while the plastron was still intact (Figure 1A). Adjacent to 7 of the 8 remains we located numerous bone fragments including parts of the carapace and limbs as well as dried intestines in a nearby Range Rhatany (Krameria parvifolia) shrub. The significance of the frequent use of this shrub is puzzling. Three of the Desert Tortoise shell remains possessed distinctive intercanine punctures measuring 55-60 mm center to center indicating that this was an adult sized Mountain Lion. By comparison, a 2 year old male Mountain Lion salvaged on NTS had an upper intercanine bite width of 45 mm, and a 6 month old kitten measured 35mm respectively. The Mountain Lion (Puma concolor) is the only predator that exists in southern Nevada that could possibly have a bite with a gap between its upper canine teeth that large (Murmann et al. 2006. J. Forensic Sci. 51:846-860). The appearance of the shell remains in Figure 1A is similar to that depicting Jaguar (Panthera onca) predation, on the Amazonian Tortoise (Geochelone denticulata) as illustrated by Emmons (1989. J. Herpetol. 23:311-314) with the majority of the carapace broken open and the plastron still intact. Predation of Desert Tortoises by Mountain Lions was also documented in 1993 in southern Arizona (Little Shipp Wash Plot), where 7 of 8 carcasses found were attributed to Mountain Lion predation (Averill-Murray et al. 2002. In. T.R.Van Devender [ed.], The Sonoran Desert Tortoise: Natural History, Biology, and Conservation, pp.109-134. University of Arizona Press and Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, Tucson, Arizona). Similarly, predation by a Mountain Lion has been reported on the Argentine Tortoise (Chelonoidis chilensis) in Argentina (Acosta et al. 2004. Herpetol. Review 35:53-54), and a Mountain Lion kitten was observed to kill and consume a portion of the carapace of a Texas Tortoise (Gopherus berlandieri) in west Texas (Adams et al. 2006. Southwestern Nat. 51:581-581). Over the past 45 years this Desert Tortoise population has been monitored yearly, with no prior evidence of predation to tortoises within the fenced enclosures. On several occasions other predators such as Bobcats (Lynx rufus) have been observed within the study enclosures for as long as a week. Evidence of Kit Fox (Vulpes macrotus) sign has been observed on numerous occasions, and a Spotted Skunk (Spilogale putorius) and Longtail Weasels (Mustela frenata) have been captured and released (B.G. Maza, pers. comm.; Medica 1990. Great Basin Nat. 50:83-84), while Coyotes (Canis latrans) were never observed within the fenced enclosures. Prior to this predation event in Rock Valley, 17 Desert Tortoises were alive between 2000 and 2002, only 7 were known to be alive in 2004, while 2 tortoises have not been seen since 2002. Predation studies of Mountain Lions indicate that these events may be an example of a learned behavior of individual animals developing a preference for a prey (Logan and Sweanor 2001, Desert Puma: Evolutionary ecology and conservation of an enduring carnivore. Hornocker Wildlife Institute, Island Press, Washington. 463 pp.; Creeden and Graham 1997, Desert Bighorn Council Transactions. p. 37-43), or the plight of a large predator locating an available source of food while passing through low elevation Mojave Desert habitat in late summer or early fall.« less

AB  - Standard line-transect census techniques were deployed to generate a checklist and quantify the abundance of medium and large-bodied vertebrate species in forest areas of eastern Amazonia with and without a history of reduced-impact logging (RIL). Three areas were allocated a total of 1,196.9 km of line-transect census effort. Sampling was conducted from April to June 2012 and from April to August 2013, and detected 29 forest vertebrate species considered in this study belonging to 15 orders, 20 families and 28 genera. Additionally, eight species were recorded outside census walks through direct and indirect observations. Of this total, six species are considered vulnerable according to IUCN (Ateles paniscus, Myrmecophaga tridactyla, Priodontes maximus, Tapirus terrestris, Tayassu peccary, Chelonoidis denticulata). Observed species richness ranged from 21 to 24 species in logged and unlogged areas, and encounter rates along transects were highly variable between treatments. However, the relative abundance of species per transect did not differ between transects in logged and unlogged forests. Of the species detected during censuses, only three showed different relative abundance between the two treatments (Saguinus midas, Tinamus spp. and Dasyprocta leporina). Our results show that the effect of RIL forest management was a relatively unimportant determinant of population abundance for most medium and large vertebrates over the time period of the survey.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Human societies have food taboos as social rules that restrict access to a particular animal. Taboos are pointed out as tools for the conservation of animals, considering that the presence of this social rule prevents the consumption of animals. This work consists of a systematic review that aimed to verify how food taboos vary between different animal species, and how this relationship has influenced their conservation.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">For this systematic review, the search for articles by keywords took place in the databases "Science Direct," Scopus," "SciELo" and "Web of Science," associating the term "taboo" with the taxa "amphibians," "birds," "mammals," "fish" and "reptiles." From this search, 3959 titles were found related to the key terms of the research. After the entire screening process carried out by paired reviewers, only 25 articles were included in the search.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">It was identified that 100 species of animals are related to some type of taboo, and segmental taboos and specific taboos were predominant, with 93 and 31 citations, respectively. In addition, the taxon with the most taboos recorded was fish, followed by mammals. Our findings indicate that the taboo protects 99% of the animal species mentioned, being a crucial tool for the conservation of these species.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The present study covered the status of current knowledge about food taboos associated with wildlife in the world. It is noticeable that taboos have a considerable effect on animal conservation, as the social restrictions imposed by taboos effectively contribute to the local conservation of species.</AbstractText>

AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">The genus Cissophyllus (Cosmocercoidea: Kathlaniidae) is a rare group of nematodes parasitic in turtles and lizards. To date, only four species have been reported in Asia and North America. However, most of them are inadequately described. The species Cissophyllus leytensis has never been reported since it was originally described by Tubangui and Villaamil in 1933 from the Philippine sailfin lizard Hydrosaurus pustulatus (Eschscholtz, 1829) (Reptilia: Squamata). Furthermore, the systematic status of Cissophyllus/Cissophyllinae in the family Kathlaniidae of the superfamily Cosmocercoidea remains under debate.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">The detailed morphology of C. leytensis was studied using light microscopy (LM) and, for the first time, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), based on newly collected specimens from the type host H. pustulatus. Six different genetic markers, including nuclear sequences [small ribosomal subunit (18S), internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and large ribosomal subunit (28S)], plus mitochondrial genes [cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1), cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2 (cox2) and 12S small subunit ribosomal RNA gene] of C. leytensis were sequenced. Additionally, in order to test the validity of the subfamily Cissophyllinae and clarify the phylogenetic relationships of Cissophyllus and the other genera in the family Kathlaniidae, phylogenetic analyses based on 18S + 28S and ITS sequence data were performed using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) analyses, respectively.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Our observations using LM and SEM revealed some previously unreported morphological features, necessitating the redescription of this poorly known species. The presence of remarkable morphological variation in the isthmus and the position of excretory pore among different individuals was found. Molecular analysis showed no intraspecific nucleotide divergence detected in the 18S, ITS, 28S, cox2 and 12S regions among different individuals of C. leytensis, but a low level of intraspecific genetic variation was found in the cox1 (0.52%). Our phylogenetic results showed the representatives of the Cosmocercoidea divided into four large clades (Cosmocerca + Aplectana + Cosmocercoides representing the family Cosmocercidae, Cruzia representing the subfamily Cruzinae of Kathlaniidae, Falcaustra + Cissophyllus + Megalobatrachonema representing the subfamily Kathlaniinae of Kathlaniidae, and Orientatractis + Rondonia representing the family Atractidae). The genus Cissophyllus clustered together with the genus Megalobatrachonema in both the ML and BI trees using ITS sequence data, but displayed a sister relationship to the genus Falcaustra in the ML tree and to the genera Falcaustra + Megalobatrachonema in the BI tree using 18S + 28S sequence data.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Molecular phylogenetic results further confirmed that the family Kathlaniidae is not a monophyletic group. The subfamily Cruziinae should be moved from the hitherto-defined family Kathlaniidae and elevated as a separate family Cruziidae. The present phylogenetic results also negated the validity of the subfamily Cissophyllinae and supported the genus Cissophyllus assigned in the subfamily Kathlaniinae. Molecular analysis indicated that the morphological variation in the isthmus and position of excretory pore among different individuals should be considered as intraspecific variation. Moreover, some characters important for the specific diagnosis of C. leytensis are reported for the first time: the number of acuminate denticles (lamellae) on each lip, the chitinized pharynx with three flabellate pharyngeal plates, the presence of single medioventral precloacal papilla and the detailed morphology of caudal papillae. The present study is only the second record of C. leytensis.</AbstractText>

AB  - The Amazonian tortoise Geochelone denticulata may play an important role in forest dynamics due to its highly frugivorous diet, ability to disperse viable seeds, and predilection for resting in forest gaps for thermoregulation. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the species' effectiveness as a seed disperser. We measured dispersal quantity (abundance of seeds in feces, frequency of droppings, and population density of the disperser) and dispersal quality (movement patterns, habitat use, germination rates of dispersed seeds, and recruitment probabilities of seedlings) in a SW Amazonian forest, in Peru. Population density was calculated by mark-recapture and line-transect methods. Eight individuals were radio-tracked to monitor habitat use. Diet was described from fecal samples, which were washed to count seeds and for germination experiments. Seedling survival in different environmental conditions was monitored for three plant species. Population densities with mark-recapture estimates (0.15-0.31 individuals/ha) were much higher than with line transects estimates (0.0025 individuals/ha). Diet included fruit of 55 different plant species. Dispersed seeds had high germination rates (average 76%). In spite of their low activity, we documented long seed dispersal distances (average 89.6 m). Tortoises showed a marked preference for the open-canopy swampy forest, where long term recruitment was not favorable for seedlings of the species examined. However, the high solar radiation in this forest type promoted survival of pioneer seedlings in the short term. In conclusion, while G. denticulata did not perform a very efficient role in terms of the quantity of seed dispersal, the species can be considered efficient in many aspects of dispersal quality.

AB  - Chelonians, an order of the class Reptilia are mostly long lived animals with relatively small capacity for rapid population growth (POUGH; HEISER; MCFARLAND, 1999). The most widely distributed genus is the Chelonoidis, which comprises 22 species found in South America, Africa, Asia and the Oceanic Islands. In Brazil, two species of turtles come from humid forests, the Chelonoidis carbonaria and Chelonoidis denticulata. The devastation and deforestation of these forests are pointed out as one of the reasons for species of this genus to spread and even mate with each other. Hybrids may compete for resources with parental species, favored by “hybrid vigor” or, if they are fertile, have an impact on the genetic integrity of wild populations due to the potential risk of backcrossing with consequent introgression. Hybridization can pose a threat to small populations, even when the gene sets do not mix. There are records of hybrids involving species of the same suborder, with the genus Trachemys (JACKSON, 2010). In order to provide subsidies for the improvement of sustainable biological management and conservation programs as well as for future projects to be developed with chelonians, this work aimed the characterization of the karyotypes by means of conventional staining, chromosome banding and mapping of some repetitive DNAs in two Chelonoidis kept in captivity.
