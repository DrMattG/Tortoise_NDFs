AB  - Twenty-four juvenile leopard tortoises were divided into four groups of six; one group was fed a basic low-calcium feed for six months, and the other three groups were fed the same basic diet supplemented with one, three and nine times the amount of calcium recommended as a supplement to the diet of reptiles. The animals' bone mineral content and bone mineral density were estimated by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, and blood samples were taken at the start and at the conclusion of the study. One tortoise from each group was examined postmortem. There was a clear depletion of calcium in the body of the tortoises receiving no calcium supplement, and the shell of the tortoises receiving the recommended calcium supplement did not calcify to the extent expected. The tortoises that received three times the recommended calcium supplementation had the highest growth rate and were thriving. However, metastatic calcifications were observed postmortem in the two groups that were given the highest doses of calcium.

AB  - Preference testing has long been used in ethology and animal welfare science to assess the preferences that animals have for different resources and stimuli. The study conducted herein assessed the choice-making ability of five leopard tortoises Stigmochelys pardalis in a novel two-phase preference test. Phase 1 was a discrete choice test in a y-maze with two options: food in one arm, the other arm left empty, with positions fixed per tortoise, but randomised across tortoises. Multivariate ANOVA were performed on three dependent variables of time taken to make a choice in both phases. In Phase 1, four of the five tortoises clearly chose the food arm more than the empty arm. One tortoise chose the food arm and empty arm equally (50/50). Phase 2 involved opening an additional arm on the maze and offering each tortoise three choices: food (the same as Phase 1); human interaction (shell scratches and rubs using hands); or an empty arm. Positions were again fixed per tortoise but randomised across tortoises. In Phase 2, tortoise choices were more varied. Two tortoises chose human interaction more than the other two maze arms; another two chose the food maze arm most; and one did not seem to show a strong preference for any particular arm. These results suggested that some individuals of this species of tortoise may possibly prefer this form of human interaction (shell scratches and rubs) over other stimuli in certain conditions; however, further research is necessary to improve the confidence of the conclusions presented herein.

AB  - In 1973 the Convention in International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) was called to life as to regulate the international wildlife trade, and to prevent species becoming (economically and biologically) extinct. The trade in freshwater turtles and tortoises in Asia is so huge that it threatens the survival of many species. In 2006 and 2007, during three surveys at Chatuchak market in Bangkok, Thailand, we recorded a signifi cant trade in non-native CITES-listed freshwater turtles and tortoises to be used as pets. We documented a total of 688 individuals of 19 species from different regions of the world, many of which are globally threatened with extinction. Most commonly recorded were three species of tortoise from Madagascar and Africa, i.e. Radiated Tortoise Geochelone radiata, Spurred Tortoise G. sulcata and Leopard Tortoise G. pardalis. Five species were listed on CITES Appendix I, precluding all international trade, and an additional six Appendix II or III-listed species that can be traded albeit regulated, were not registered as being imported into Thailand in the last six year. CITES I-listed species were not more expensive than CITES II or III listed species, nor was there a relationship between retail price and numbers of turtles observed. The large number and availability of illegally sourced animals indicates a blatant disregard for law and authority by traders both from Thailand and from exporting countries. We conclude that the trade in these species, in such signifi cant volumes, is of serious conservation concern, and in order for CITES to be more effective it is imperative that Parties recognize the scale of the international trade in freshwater turtles and tortoises and respond accordingly.

AB  - Amblyomma marmoreum and A. sparsum ticks were collected from tortoises imported into Florida from Africa and were tested for Cowdria ruminantium infection using a C. ruminantium-specific pCS20 polymerase chain reaction assay. In 1 shipment imported from Zambia, 15 of the 38 A. sparsum male ticks collected from the leopard tortoises (Geochelone pardalis) were found to be positive for infection with C. ruminantium. In contrast, all 148 A. marmoreum tested were negative for C. ruminantium infection. This is the first reported evidence of the introduction of heartwater-infected ticks into the United States, but there were no opportunities to confirm isolation of C. ruminantium from the ticks by either culture or transmission studies.

AB  - THE ABSORPTION SPECTRUM OF OXYGEN.—About three years ago M. Egorofif was able to show that the great groups A and B in the solar spectrum were due to the absorption of oxygen. More recently the a band was also found to be due to the same gas. M. Janssen, studying the absorption of oxygen has now discovered that under certain conditions the gas yields another spectrum, composed no longer of lines easily separated, but of shaded bands which can only be resolved with great difficulty. This system of bands appears for moderate pressures much later than the spectrum of lines, but it shows itself very quickly with increase of the density: the two systems are so different that it is possible to obtain either the first without the second or vice versâ. M. Janssen was at first unable to explain how it was that these bands were not visible in the solar spectrum when they were easily obtained by passing light through thicknesses of oxygen far less than the sun's light has to traverse before reaching us. But further experiments showed that these bands did not develop in proportion to the thickness of the stratum of oxygen producing them, multiplied by its density, but in proportion to the thickness multiplied by the square of the density. The density of our atmosphere being small as compared with some of the pressures at which M. Janssen worked, the non-appearance of these bands amongst the telluric lines of the solar spectrum is readily explained.

AB  - Biomacromolecules have transformed our capacity to effectively treat diseases; however, their rapid degradation and poor absorption in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract generally limit their administration to parenteral routes. An oral biologic delivery system must aid in both localization and permeation to achieve systemic drug uptake. Inspired by the leopard tortoise's ability to passively reorient, we developed an ingestible self-orienting millimeter-scale applicator (SOMA) that autonomously positions itself to engage with GI tissue. It then deploys milliposts fabricated from active pharmaceutical ingredients directly through the gastric mucosa while avoiding perforation. We conducted in vivo studies in rats and swine that support the applicator's safety and, using insulin as a model drug, demonstrated that the SOMA delivers active pharmaceutical ingredient plasma levels comparable to those achieved with subcutaneous millipost administration.

AB  - Between September 1982 and January 1984, verminous colitis was diagnosed post mortem in eight red-footed tortoises (Geochelone carbonaria) and three leopard tortoises (Geochelone pardalis) from the reptile collection of the National Zoological Park. This represented 69% of 16 tortoise necropsy accessions for that period. Etiology was determined to be a viviparous pinworm-like nematode of the genus Proatractis (Family Atractidae). Clinical signs were either nonspecific, consisting of anorexia, lethargy, and depression, or were absent. Limited trials with piperazine citrate and fenbendazole appeared to be ineffectual against the parasite and supportive therapy was unsuccessful. Post mortem examination revealed roughening and thickening of the mucosa of the cecum and colon, and in severe cases myriads of tiny (0.5–1.0 cm) nematodes were evident on the mucosal surface. In six tortoises, worms were found also in the small intestine. Histopathologic features in severe cases included mucosal necrosis with parasi...

Molecular as well as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) characterization suggests that it could correspond to a new Campylobacter species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY The major impact of this work is the demonstration that proteomics and especially MALDI-TOF typing can be used as an alternative method to 16S rDNA sequencing for phylogeny and can lead to the discovery of new Campylobacters.

AB  - The tortoise tick Amblyomma marmoreum was collected from large numbers of reptiles and other animals during the course of numerous surveys conducted in South Africa. A total of 1 229 ticks, of which 550 were adults, were recovered from 309 reptiles belonging to 13 species, with leopard tortoises, Geochelone pardalis being the most heavily infested. The 269 birds sampled harboured 4 901 larvae, 217 nymphs and no adult ticks, and the prevalence of infestation was greatest on hel meted guinea fowls, Numida meleagris . Only two larvae were recovered from 610 rodents, including 31 spring hares, Pedetes capensis , whereas 1 144 other small mammals yielded 1 835 immature ticks, of which 1 655 were collected from 623 scrub hares, Lepus saxatilis . The 213 carnivores examined harboured 2 459 ticks of which none were adult. A single adult tick and 6 684 larvae and 62 nymphs were recovered from 656 large herbivores, and a total of 4 081 immature ticks and three adults were collected from 1 543 domestic animals and 194 humans. Adult male and female A. marmoreum were most numerous on reptiles during January and February, and larvae during March. The largest numbers of larvae were present on domestic cattle and helmeted guineafowls in the Eastern Cape Province during March or April respectively, whereas larvae were most numerous on helmeted guineafowls, scrub hares and the vegetation in north-eastern Mpumalanga Province during May. In both provinces nymphs were most numerous between October and December. Amblyomma marmoreum appears to be most prevalent in the western regions of the Western and Eastern Cape and Free State provinces, and the north-eastern regions of the Northern Cape, KwaZulu- Natal, Mpumulanga and Limpopo provinces.

AB  - A survey of Amblyomma marmoreum Koch ticks recorded from the leopard tortoise, Geochelone paradalis Bell, in the National Zoological Gardens, Pretoria, South Africa, was carried out over a 19-mo period. No significant differences were found between the tick burdens on male and female tortoises. A. marmoreum showed a clear seasonal pattern of abundance. Larvae were present on the tortoise host during late summer, with a peak in February and March; nymphs were abundant during winter, with a peak in June and July. Male ticks were found throughout the year, but females were present only during spring and early to midsummer with a peak in October. It was demonstrated that each developmental stage of A. marmoreum showed only one peak of activity per year.

AB  - Chelonian intranuclear coccidiosis has been reported once, in two radiated tortoises (Geochelone radiata), and is apparently rare. We describe intranuclear coccidiosis diagnosed histologically in two radiated tortoises, three Travancore tortoises (Indotestudo forstenii), two leopard tortoises (Geochelone pardalis), one bowsprit tortoise (Chersina angulata), and one impressed tortoise (Manouria impressa). Infection was systemic and involved alimentary, urogenital, respiratory, lymphoid, endocrine, and integumentary systems. Trophozoites, meronts, merozoites, macrogametocytes, microgametocytes, and nonsporulated oocysts were seen histologically or by electron microscopy. Intracytoplasmic and extracellular stages of parasite development also were identified histologically. Sequencing of a coccidial 18S rRNA consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product revealed a novel sequence that provided phylogenetic information and may be useful for further diagnostic test design. Intranuclear coccidiosis was associated with variable degrees of inflammation in all cases, was considered the cause of death in six tortoises, and was a substantial contributing factor to the cause of death in two tortoises.

AB  - ABSTRACT Seasonal habitat utilization, refugia selection, and sheltering behavior by the leopard tortoise (Geochelone pardalis) was investigated over a 24-month period (September 1990–September 1992) in the Franklin Nature Reserve, South Africa. The study area was located on Naval Hill, a dolerite and shale mesa which provided diverse topographical and vegetation aspects from which the tortoises could select habitats and refugia. Results showed that considerable shifts occurred in habitat and shelter selection between summer days, summer nights, and winter, with tortoises predominantly utilizing the plateau area. This was ascribed to the availability of shelter, exposure to solar radiation, accessibility, food resources, and the presence of water. Shelters were selected to meet specific needs governed by environmental conditions at the time, with 64.6% of shelters being exclusively utilized within one of the three periods monitored. Thirty-three plant species were utilized as shelters. Tortoises selected ...

AB  - Seasonal shifts and overlap in home range are poorly known in the Leopard Tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis). Consequently, these, together with daily distance moved, were investigated in the semiarid Nama-Karoo, as a function of season, sex, and body mass. Annual home-range size was significantly greater for telemetered compared with nontelemetered tortoises stressing the importance of telemetry in spatial ecological studies of tortoises. Consequently, only telemetered tortoises were analyzed further in terms of variation between seasons and sexes. Home ranges differed significantly with season and were smallest in winter, when tortoises were less active. Seasonal home-range size did not differ between sexes. Considerable individual variation existed in the amount of home-range overlap both within and between sexes. Daily distance moved in each season was highly variable for each individual and between individuals. However, the least movement occurred in winter in all individuals. Home-range size and daily distances moved in the active seasons were larger than for Leopard Tortoises found in more mesic habitats, suggesting a resource availability effect. Increased home-range size, in conjunction with their low density and population size, has implications for Leopard Tortoise conservation in semiarid regions in terms of planning and designating conservation areas. Variation in home-range size with regard to habitat type must be considered when planning terrestrial tortoise conservation efforts.

AB  - ABSTRACT Paramyxoviruses (PMVs) are well documented as a cause of respiratory disease in snakes, but they have only been documented in tortoises in a very few cases. This study describes a leopard tortoise (Geochelone pardalis babcocki) with lethargy and respiratory disease. Examination of tracheal swabs for bacteria resulted in strong growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Morganella morganii. Despite antibiotic therapy, the animal died. Gross pathology noted severe diffuse consolidation of the lungs. Fourteen different tissue samples were collected for virological examinations. Viruses commonly detected in tortoises (herpesviruses, picorna-like viruses, and ranaviruses) or recently reported in chelonians (adenoviruses) could not be detected in the samples by virus isolation or by molecular methods (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]). The samples were tested by reverse transcriptase-PCR for PMVs, and cloaca, heart, liver, and small intestine were found to be positive. Sequence analysis of the PMV amplicons r...

AB  - METEORS are generally rare in the early part of the year, and, in May and June, twilight is so strong that it obliterates faint objects and leaves only the more conspicuous class of meteors observable. But in July, though the sky is still very light and the nights extremely short, these objects become fairly plentiful and particularly so during the last week of the month, when the horary rate of apparition is about three times as great as it is on ordinary nights of spring and mid-summer. The meteoric observer regards July and August not only as one of the most productive seasons of work, but one which in the interesting character of its results will compare favourably with that of any other epoch of the year.

AB  - Geochelone pardalis (Bell 1828) shows wide variation of body size in
Africa, with tortoises in the north (Republic of Somaliland) being of comparable
size to insular giant tortoises. Growth data on G. pardalis, the continental giant
species G. sulcata (Miller 1779) and the Aldabran giant tortoise G. gigantea
(Schweigger 1812) were re-analysed using Ford-Walford plots, and their growth
patterns compared. All species and populations fitted a two-phase growth curve,
with initial asymptotic growth followed by slow indeterminate linear growth.
Asymptotic growth was non-Bertalanffy in all groups, with most individuals fitting
Gompertz or logistic-by-mass models best. Juvenile growth (for ages 3-8)
was also approximately linear in all groups. Variation between populations and
species was in the rate of juvenile growth, asymptotic size reached, rate of subsequent
linear growth, and survival rate of older individuals. Geochelone pardalis
from Somaliland had similar juvenile growth rates and asymptotic sizes to other
populations, and their large mean size was due to high survival and continued
linear growth after the asymptote. Geochelone sulcata had similar juvenile
growth rates to G. pardalis, but reached larger asymptotic sizes; indeterminate
linear growth was similar to that of G. pardalis. Geochelone gigantea had much
higher juvenile growth rates than the continental species, reflecting a longer
activity season. Asymptotic size and the rate of indeterminate linear growth were
lower in a high-density (Grande Terre) than low-density (Ile Malabar) population
of G. gigantea. The growth rate of juveniles was not affected by population density,
so that the Grande Terre population had higher growth rates of juveniles relative
to larger tortoises and was the only group to approach Bertalanffy-type
growth, as predicted.

AB  - In the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, larvae and nymphs of Ablyomma marmoreum Koch occur in habitats in which there is tree cover and herbaceous ground cover. Immatures of A. marmoreum are parasitic on reptiles, birds, and mammals. Adults occur only on reptiles. The major host for all stages is the moutain tortoise (Geochelone pardalis), and in the home areas of tortoises the density of ticks is high. Larvae are active in late summer and autumn. The rate of feeding is temperature-dependent, and some larvae which attach on tortoises in late autumn do not complete feeding until the following spring. Nymphs which occur in the home area of a tortoise become active in response to CO2 in early spring. Adults, and nymphs which occur outside the home area of a tortoise, become active in summer in response to rising temperatures. In nymphs which feed in spring, and hence develop into adults in midsummer, the life cycle is completed in 1 year. In nymphs which fed in midsummer, the life cycle is completed in 2 years.

AB  - <jats:p>During field surveys in the Spring of 2018 we made two observations of Leopard Tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis) on roadsides near Lambert's Bay, WC, South Africa. One was a deceased adult female, killed as a result of a tortoise-vehicle collision. The other was a live adult females, which was move off the road in the direction she was headed. These observations illustrate that even the largest tortoise species in the region can be suseptable to road mortlaity, a known threat of turtle and torioses populations globally. Furthermore, these observations occured well outside the species presumed native range and listed introduced range.  &#x0D;

AB  - The growth and weight development of Leopard tortoise hatchings (Geochelone pardalis) kept at the Al Wabra Wildlife Preservation (AWWP), Qatar, was observed for more than four years, and compared to data in literature for free-ranging animals on body weight or carapace measurements. The results document a distinctively faster growth in the captive animals. Indications for the same phenomenon in other tortoise species (Galapagos giant tortoises, G. nigra; Spur-thighed tortoises, Testudo graeca; Desert tortoises, Gopherus agassizi) were found in the literature. The cause of the high growth rate most likely is the constant provision with highly digestible food of low fiber content. Increased growth rates are suspected to have negative consequences such as obesity, high mortality, gastrointestinal illnesses, renal diseases, "pyramiding," fibrous osteodystrophy or metabolic bone disease. The apparently widespread occurrence of high growth rates in intensively managed tortoises underlines how easily ectothermic animals can be oversupplemented with nutrients.

AB  - <jats:p>Species-level phylogeny and especially phylogeography of African chelonians is a comparatively under-studied field of research. We review the current knowledge of phylogeny and phylogeography, highlight congruence of spatial phylogeographic patterns amongst chelonians and other taxa and suggest future research directions to address gaps in knowledge. Our review shows that phylogeographic and phylogenetic investigations have led to unexpected findings. For example, for<jats:italic>Pelomedusa</jats:italic>, a putatively wide-ranging monotypic terrapin genus, cryptic diversity was revealed, with more than ten species being uncovered. The formerly recognized tortoise genus<jats:italic>Homopus</jats:italic>sensu lato was found to be paraphyletic with respect to<jats:italic>Chersina</jats:italic>. To resolve this situation,<jats:italic>Homopus</jats:italic>was restricted to the four-toed species<jats:italic>H. areolatus</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>H. femoralis</jats:italic>and the genus<jats:italic>Chersobius</jats:italic>was resurrected for the five-toed species<jats:italic>C. boulengeri</jats:italic>,<jats:italic>C. signatus</jats:italic>, and<jats:italic>C. solus</jats:italic>. Three previously recognized taxa were shown to be invalid, viz. the putatively extinct terrapin species<jats:italic>Pelusios seychellensis</jats:italic>and the tortoise subspecies<jats:italic>Chersobius signatus cafer</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Stigmochelys pardalis babcocki</jats:italic>. Together with taxonomy, the knowledge of phylogeographic structuring sets a solid foundation for conservation measures and allows the identification of Management and Conservation Units. However, the current legislation, in particular the enforcement of the Nagoya Protocol under the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD), has largely halted research on widely distributed taxa and turned the well-intended concept of Access and Benefit Sharing into a major impediment for conservation and research. The current situation leads for many species to a continued usage of outdated and incorrect taxonomic classifications resulting in an error cascade of conservation decisions. This is counterproductive to the aims of the CBD, that is, the protection of biodiversity. Sequencing historical DNA from museum specimens using aDNA approaches could be a short-term approach to mitigate, but not solve, this impediment.</jats:p>

AB  - Tortoises (Testudinidae) occur in a wide range of environments, providing important ecosystem functions, such as seed dispersal and refuge in the form of burrows. Tortoise movement has previously been shown to be related to resource availability, reproductive status and local environmental conditions. However, understanding of the variables that drive their movement remains comparatively low. We investigated aspects of movement in leopard tortoises Stigmochelys pardalis—the largest and most abundant tortoise species in sub-Saharan Africa—in response to environmental, climatic and individual variables in the semi-arid Karoo, South Africa. We used GPS telemetry to calculate bihourly and daily movement and used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to ascertain important predictor variables. Temperature, distance from water sources, and month were important variables for predicting both bihourly and daily movement. Our results showed that movement increased when individuals were close to known water sources, indicating that individuals close to water resources make regular long distance movements. Movement showed a positive relationship for temperature in both models, whilst rainfall was an important predictor for bihourly movement. Our results displayed aspects of seasonality, with movement highest in spring months, likely related to reproductive activities, although no sex differences were observed. We identified temporal and spatial conditions in which leopard tortoise movement increased. Our results further support the relationship between water as a resource and movement in leopard tortoises. Individuals used one of two basic movement behaviours in relation to water in this water scarce environment. Either an individual’s home range and movements included permanent water resources allowing internal water storage replenishment, or excluded these with reliance on food resources (such as grasses, forbs, and succulents) for water.

AB  - Two species of tortoises are known from Pliocene sites on the Eyasi Plateau, including Laetoli. The most common species is a medium-sized tortoise, Stigmochelys brachygularis, which is well represented in the Laetolil Beds (∼3.6–4.4 Ma) and Upper Ndolanya Beds (∼2.66 Ma). The giant tortoise, “Geochelone” laetoliensis, is known only from the Laetolil Beds, and is much less common than S. brachygularis. Stigmochelys brachygularis is represented by a number of relatively complete and partial shells, as well as numerous isolated and associated shell fragments, some postcranial remains and eggs. It is generally similar in size and overall morphology to the extant leopard tortoise, S. pardalis, but a number of features serve to distinguish the two species. Stigmochelys brachygularis and S. pardalis are inferred to be closely related, and are most likely sister taxa that represent time-successive species of a single lineage. The age structure of the fossil sample, in conjunction with evidence of carnivore damage on the shells, indicates that S. brachygularis was subject to relatively high levels of predation in comparison with modern-day S. pardalis. If S. brachygularis is presumed to have been ecologically similar to modern S. pardalis, it would have been capable of living in a wide range of habitats from semi-desert and savanna to open woodland. The material attributed to “Geochelone” laetoliensis is more fragmentary, and as a consequence it is not possible to determine its precise phylogenetic or taxonomic relationships. However, it likely represents a distinct genus, possibly with affinities to Astrochelys from Madagascar. A more thorough assessment of the relationships of “G.” laetoliensis with Miocene and Pliocene giant tortoises from Africa and with extant genera will have to await the recovery of more complete material from Laetoli. Giant tortoises, such as “G.” laetoliensis, became extinct on mainland Africa during the late Pliocene, possibly associated with the appearance of early Homo and stone tool using behaviors at 2.6 Ma.

AB  - Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) is an arbovirus with a multisegmented genome related to those of unsegmented flaviviruses. The virus first described in <i>Rhipicephalus microplus</i> ticks collected in Jingmen city (Hubei Province, China) in 2010 is associated with febrile illness in humans. Since then, the geographic range has expanded to include Trinidad and Tobago, Brazil, and Uganda. However, the ecology of JMTV remains poorly described in Africa. We screened adult ticks (<i>n</i> = 4550, 718 pools) for JMTV infection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Ticks were collected from cattle (<i>n</i> = 859, 18.88%), goats (<i>n</i> = 2070, 45.49%), sheep (<i>n</i> = 1574, 34.59%), and free-ranging tortoises (Leopard tortoise, <i>Stigmochelys pardalis</i>) (<i>n</i> = 47, 1.03%) in two Kenyan pastoralist-dominated areas (Baringo and Kajiado counties) with a history of undiagnosed febrile human illness. Surprisingly, ticks collected from goats (0.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1-0.5), sheep (1.8%, 95% CI 1.2-2.5), and tortoise (74.5%, 95% CI 60.9-85.4, were found infected with JMTV, but ticks collected from cattle were all negative. JMTV ribonucleic acid (RNA) was also detected in blood from tortoises (66.7%, 95% CI 16.1-97.7). Intragenetic distance of JMTV sequences originating from tortoise-associated ticks was greater than that of sheep-associated ticks. Phylogenetic analyses of seven complete-coding genome sequences generated from tortoise-associated ticks formed a monophyletic clade within JMTV strains from other countries. In summary, our findings confirm the circulation of JMTV in ticks in Kenya. Further epidemiological surveys are needed to assess the potential public health impact of JMTV in Kenya.

AB  - The leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis) is the largest of southern Africa’s 13 tortoise species, and occurs in a variety of habitats from arid and semi-arid areas to mesic grassveld, savanna and bushveld. Seasonal activity patterns of S. pardalis were investigated as a function of rainfall, sex, time of day, temperature and time after sunrise on farmland in the semi-arid Nama-Karoo, South Africa. We predicted that because of seasonal rainfall, and subsequent increase in the food available, activity patterns of leopard tortoises would vary greatly among seasons, but that the primary constraint on activity levels within a season would be ambient temperature. Type of activity, time of day that the activity was performed, and the frequency that each activity was performed, differed among seasons. There was no overall seasonal difference in the level of activity with sex, but in certain seasons and with regard to specific activities, there were significant differences between the sexes. Diel activity was ...

AB  - Studies using the African tortoise tick (Amblyomma marmoreum) and leopard tortoises (Geochelone pardalis) demonstrated that cyfluthrin and permethrin were safe and efficacious acaricides for control of Amblyomma ticks on tortoises. A protocol was developed that successfully eradicated an A. sparsum infestation from a tortoise breeding facility in Florida. It involved treatment of all tortoises with a permethrin formulation, followed by treatment of the premises with a cyfluthrin formulation. Sentinel tortoises were later placed on the treated premises to establish successful tick eradication.

AB  - The success of natural infestations of various life history stages of Amblyomma hebraeum and Amblyomma marmoreum on the leopard tortoise, Geochelone pardalis, was compared. Success was measured by the time taken for ticks to detach, as well as the percentage of ticks engorging and subsequently either moulting to the next life history stage or laying viable eggs. Larvae of A. hebraeum were the only developmental stage not recovered. Nymphae and female A. hebraeum were less successful in moulting or laying eggs than the corresponding stages of A. marmoreum. Nevertheless, 48,7% of A. hebraeum nymphae moulted, while 1 of 6 females laid viable eggs.

AB  - The diet and plant species preferences of two sympatric tortoises, the mountain tortoise Geochelone partialis and serrated tortoise Psammobates oculifer, were studied in the northern Cape Province, South Africa. Owing to the difference in rainfall patterns during the two years of study, differing results were obtained between study periods and between tortoise species. During the dry year both tortoises used the vegetation in relation to its availability; grass was used extensively as were succulents. In the higher rainfall study period a greater variety of ephemerals was available. The mountain tortoise extended its use of available species but continued to use grass; this component disappeared completely from the diet of the serrated tortoise and they concentrated on herbs and succulents. Preference in both species is for succulents and species of the Fabaceae. Tribulus terrestris also featured in both diets in both periods. It is suggested that the patterns shown reflect the climatic affinities of the two species.
Die dieet en plantspesievoorkeure van twee simpatriese skilpaaie, die bergskilpad Geochelone partialis en knoppiesdopskilpad Psammobates oculifer, is in die Noord-Kaap, Suid-Afrika ondersoek. As gevolg van verskillende reenval patrone tydens die twee jaar van die studie was daar verskille tussen studieperiodes en skilpadspesies. Tydens die droe jaar was plantegroeibenutting volgens beskikbaarheid en is gras deur beide skilpaaie gebruik. Sukkulente plantspesies is ook verkies. Gedurende die natter periode was daar meer opslag en die bergskilpad het sy plantspesiebenutting uitgebrei, gras was egter nog steeds belangrik. Die knoppiesdopskilpad se dieet het egter heeltemal afgewyk van die vorige patroon; 'n wye verskeidenheid efemere is benut en gras het glad nie in die dieet voorgekom nie. Voorkeur by beide skilpadsoorte was vir sukkulente en spesies van die Fabaceae. Tribulus terrestris het ook 'n duidelike voorkeur gehad in die dieet van beide skilpadsoorte in beide periodes. Dit word voorgestel dat die patrone wat in die studie openbaar word met die klimaatsafiniteite van die twee spesies verband hou.

AB  - Occurrence and activity budget of the leopard tortoise, Geochelone pardalis were studied in northern Tanzania between October 1993 and June 1996. Tortoises occurred most frequently in short grass (51.5%) and along roads and track verges (33.9%), but only occasionally in the bush undergrowth (6.7%) and shambas (3.6%). Walking (46.3%) and feeding (37.2%) were the most frequent activities. Resting was observed only occasionally (13.6%) while courtship (1.9%) and drinking (0.9%) were rarely recorded. Activity budget differed significantly between the age classes and habitats, but not between the sexes. Juveniles walked more frequently (59.3%) than other age classes. Walking was most frequent along roads and tracks (68.8%). Adult tortoises rested more frequently (18.7%) than other age classes but the difference was not significant. The proportions of individuals resting in the various habitats differed significantly, with resting being most frequent in the shrub undergrowth (93.3%). Juveniles were observed feeding less frequently than other age classes but the difference was not significant. Feeding was recorded in all habitats, but it was least frequent in the shrub undergrowth. Tanzania Journal of Science Volume 27 (2001), pp. 87-99

AB  - During the period 1988-1991, reptiles (23 snakes, 36 tortoises, 25 chameleons and 2 monitor lizards) from Central, Lusaka and Southern Provinces of Zambia were caught and checked for ticks. Only 2 snakes, respectively one Python sebae (Gmelin, 1789) and one Bitis arietans (Merrem, 1820), 8 tortoises, respectively seven Geochelone pardalis (Bell, 1828) and one Kinixys belliana (Gray, 1831) were found infested with a small number of ticks: nymphs and adults of Aponomma latum (Koch, 1844) and Amblyomma marmoreum Koch, 1844. Ticks were not observed on chameleons Chamaeleo dilepis (Leach, 1819) and monitor lizards Varanus niloticus (Linneo, 1758). The author makes some observations about the role and the effects of ticks on reptiles and discusses the present findings, comparing the data provided by other authors.

AB  - We used a five-gene data set (mtDNA: 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, cyt-b; nDNA: Cmos, Rag2) comprising approximately two-thirds of all extant testudinid species and, for the first time, including all five Testudo species to investigate the question of whether all western Palaearctic testudinids are monophyletic. Further, we examined whether the recently suggested allocation of the African Geochelone pardalis in the otherwise exclusively South African genus Psammobates and of the Malagasy G. yniphora in the monotypic genus Angonoka is justified in the face of considerable morphological evidence against such placements. Our phylogenetic analyses do not support the paraphyly and generic break-up of Testudo, as suggested by previous papers using a smaller taxon sampling and mtDNA data only. We propose a continued usage of the generic name Testudo for all five western Palaearctic tortoise species. Within Testudo, two monophyletic subclades are present, one containing T. hermanni+T. horsfieldii, and the other comprising (T. kleinmanni+T. marginata)+T. graeca. Nomenclaturally, we demonstrate that Eurotestudo Lapparent de Broin et al., 2006, which was recently erected with the type species T. hermanni, is an objective junior synonym of Chersine Merrem, 1820 and Medaestia Wussow, 1916. Recognition of a monotypic genus Angonoka for G. yniphora is unwarranted according to both our re-analysis of sequence data and morphological data. Acknowledging the strong morphological similarity between G. yniphora and G. radiata, we suggest placing both species into the genus Astrochelys. Although sequence data for only one of the three Psammobates species was available for analysis, there is currently no cause to challenge the monophyly of this genus as established on the basis of morphological evidence. Thus, we hypothesize that G. pardalis is sister to a monophyletic Psammobates. In light of the clear morphological gap between G. pardalis and Psammobates species, the recognition of a distinct genus Stigmochelys for the former seems justified.

AB  - II. THAT the power possessed by different very highly explosive substances, of inducing the detonation of such bodies as gun-cotton and nitro-glycerine, is not solely ascribable to the operation of mechanical force very suddenly developed, is indicated not only by the singular inertness of gun-cotton to the influence of nitro-glycerine as a detonating agent, but also by a comparison of the behaviour of other detonating substances wich that of the mercuric fulminate, when applied to the detonation of gun-cotton. Thus the detonation of silver fulminate is very decidedly sharper than that of the mercury compound, yet it is in no way superior to the latter in its power as an initiative detonating agent; indeed, a somewhat larger amount of it appeared to be required than of the mercury salt to induce detonation of gun-cotton with certainty. Again, the iodide and chloride of nitrogen are far more susceptible of sudden detonation than the silver fulminate; yet while 5 grains of the latter, confined in a stout metal envelope, suffice to detonate gun-cotton, 50 grains of chloride of nitrogen confined by water, appeared to be the minimum amount with which the detonation of gun-cotton could be accomplished with certainty, while no success attended the employment of confined iodide of nitrogen in quantities ranging up to 100 grains.

AB  - Fifty-two tortoises, comprising 50 leopard tortoises Geochelone pardalis, one angulate tortoise Chersina angulata and one marsh terrapin Pelomedusa subrufa were found dead along 8,4 km of electrified fences in the Thomas Baines Nature Reserve, eastern Cape Province. Sixteen of these mortalities occurred during a 132-day study period. Assuming reduced tortoise activity in winter, a conservative mortality rate of about 30 tortoises per year is estimated along the electrified fence in the reserve. Using regression curves based on detailed measurements of 109 leopard tortoises, the total length and shell height of 42 of the electrocuted animals were calculated from their plastron lengths. Most tortoises (93%) killed were young adults (200-400 mm total length). The height of the electrified wire measured at the point of electrocution of 30 dead tortoises was, with one exception, less than 200 mm above ground level. To reduce tortoise mortality in the reserve it is recommended that the electrified wire height be maintained at at least 250 mm above ground level, and that the fences be powered only at night.
Twee en vyftig dooie skilpaaie (50 bergskilpaaie Geochelone pardalis, een ploegskaarskilpad Chersina angulata en een gewone waterskilpad Pelomedusa subrufa) is langs 8,4 km geelektrifiseerde omheinings in die Thomas Baines-natuurreservaat in die oostelike Kaapprovinsie gevind. Sestien van hierdie skilpadvrektes het plaasgevind gedurende 'n studietydperk van 132 dae. As aanvaar word dat skilpaaie minder aktief is gedurende die winter, dan word daar na beraming ongeveer 30 skilpaaie jaarliks deur hierdie geelektrifiseerde drade gedood in die reservaat. Met behulp van regressiekrommes,gebaseer op mates van 109 bergskilpaaie, is die plastronlengtes van 42 van die dooie skilpaaie gebruik om hul totale lengtes en dophoogtes te bereken. Die meeste van die dooie skilpaaie (93%) was jong volwassenes (200-400 mm totale lengte). Die hoogte van die geelektrifiseerde drade, gemeet by die punt van elektrokusie van 30 skilpaaie was, met een uitsondering, minder as 200 mm bokant grondvlak. Dit word aanbeveel dat die hoogte van geelektrifiseerde drade ten minste 250 mm bokant grondvlak gehandhaaf word, en dat heinings slegs gedurende die nag geelektrifiseer word om sodoende skilpadmortaliteit in die reservaat te verlaag.

Geen territorialiteit bestaan nie maar wel loopgebiede waarbinne die skilpad meeste van sy aktiwiteite bedryf. Bewegingspatrone van 'n aantal individuele skilpaaie word bespreek. This study ascertains whether the mountain tortoise Geochelone pardalis Bell, 1828, shows habitat preferences and territorial tendencies. No territorialism was found but most activities took place within a certain range. Movement patterns of a number of individual tortoises are described.

AB  - Abstract The Leopard Tortoise (Geochelone pardalis) is the largest of the southern African species and has a wide distribution encompassing a variety of habitats. There is a paucity of ecological information about Leopard Tortoises in these habitats. The goal of this study was to determine the population density, biomass, sex and age distributions, and morphometrics of Leopard Tortoises on farmland in the semi-arid Nama-Karoo. Because previous studies have found that body size distributions vary between mesic and xeric habitats, we expected that these Leopard Tortoises would show an increased body size compared to those from more mesic areas. In addition, we expected lower densities of Leopard Tortoises compared to more mesic areas. In total, 92 tortoises were caught with a male to female sex ratio of 1:1.3 that was not significantly different from unity. Adult females were significantly larger than males with respect to all morphometric measurements. Leopard Tortoises (excluding juveniles) were larger th...

AB  - Blood films were examined from 154 wild and captive tortoises from four provinces of South Africa, including Gauteng, Kwazulu-Natal, North West and Western Cape. The five species of chelonians studied were Chersina angulata (Schweigger), Kinixys belliana belliana (Gray), K. lobatsiana Power, K. natalensis Hewitt, and Stigmochelys pardalis (Bell). Two species of haemogregarines, previously reported from Mozambique, were identified in blood films, namely Haemogregarina fitzsimonsi Dias, 1953 and Haemogregarina parvula Dias, 1953. Additional stages of development (trophozoites and probable meronts, merozoites and immature gamonts) in blood preparations from South Africa warranted the redescription of H. fitzsimonsi. A variety of hosts and broad host distribution range were observed for this haemogregarine, with all five species of tortoises parasitized, wild and captive, from all four provinces, in all seasons. In contrast, only two individuals of K. b. belliana and one S. pardalis, all three captive in Kwazulu-Natal, contained H. parvula with encapsulated stages resembling those of Hemolivia mauritanica (Sergent et Sergent, 1904). For H. fitzsimonsi, parasite prevalences, but not parasitaemias, were significantly higher in captive than wild S. pardalis; captive female S. pardalis also showed a significantly greater prevalence of infection than males, but younger, lighter hosts were not significantly more heavily parasitized than older, heavier individuals. The ticks, Amblyomma marmoreum Koch, 1844 and A. sylvaticum (De Geer, 1778), found attached to some tortoises, may prove to be definitive hosts for the two species of haemogregarines observed.

AB  - Behavioral thermoregulation is used by tortoises (Family Testudinidae) to moderate the effects of daily and seasonal fluctuations in ambient temperature on their body temperature. Extensive use is made of refuges to facilitate this behavioural thermoregulation. The Nama-Karoo in South Africa experiences wide temperature fluctuations both daily and seasonally. We investigated the seasonal use of refuges by the leopard tortoise (Geochelone pardalis) and the orientation of the tortoises within the refuges. Turtles used a wide variety of refuges, with Lycium spp., Eberlanzia ferox, Opuntia ficus, and grass clumps being preferred. Seasonal variation in the use of these refuges depended on whether the refuges were used as forms or shelters. Tortoises in spring and winter often remained in the same refuge for the entire season or returned to the same refuge on consecutive nights. We found seasonal and behavioral variation in (a) the orientation of the tortoises within a refuge, and (b) the portion of the shell of each leopard tortoise within a refuge that was exposed to solar radiation. Tortoises in winter and spring maximized the amount of solar radiation received on their shells, while tortoises in summer and autumn minimized the solar radiation received. Consequently, using a combination of refuge type, and body orientation, leopard tortoises appear to passively thermoregulate and thus control for temperature fluctuations experienced in an extreme environment.

AB  - Abstract Radiated Tortoises (Geochelone radiata) fed on 29 species of plants comprising 18 families. Grasses comprised 58.1% of observed plant diet followed by Opuntia at 7.6%. All other observed plant feedings were less than 5% each and together comprised a total of 23.3% of the diet. Animal derived matter and miscellaneous items comprise 11.0% of the diet. Diet was compared with that of the Leopard Tortoise (Geochelone pardalis) in South and East Africa. Geochelone radiata was also observed drinking freestanding water after rains. Water was imbibed through the external nares from small shallow pools (ranovato) that collected in crevices on flat rocks. This paper presents only preliminary observations on G. radiata diet. To obtain a full understanding of dietary requirements, more intense studies must be undertaken which include fecal analysis, germination trials, and a measure of relative abundance of plant life found in the habitat.

AB  - Variation in growth of herbivorous tortoises: causes and consequences for reproduction and health management Reptiles have very flexible growth rates, depending on living conditions - in particular dietary resources. Here, I demonstrate a difference in the growth rates of captive specimens, as compared to literature data for free-ranging ones, in Leopard tortoises (Geochelone pardalis), African spurred tortoises (G. sulcata), Hermann’s tortoises (Testudo hermanni) and Spur-thighed tortoises (T. graeca). Such high growth rates are traditionally thought to be linked to health problems. In the case of the G. sulcata dataset (spanning 18 years for the captive individuals), it could be shown that fast growth leads to a fast reproductive maturity, as expected from inflexion points of growth curves. In a retrospective evaluation of 539 tortoise patients of the University of Zurich, no evidence for diet- or growth-related disease risk was found in animals that were particularly heavy for their age. However, typical diet- or growth-related disorders were more frequent among younger patients, suggesting that animals with such problems do not often survive to an older age. Raising tortoises on intensive feeding regimes in captivity may considerably shorten generation times during the breeding stage of restocking programs. Whether fast growth presents a health risk needs to be evaluated in controlled studies. The observations also suggest that feeding regimes in captivity – even of appropriate diets - should be restricted if replication of conditions in the wild is a husbandry objective. 


Reptilien haben sehr flexible Wachstumsraten, je nach Haltungsbedingungen – insbesondere je nach Futterung. Hier werden Unterschiede im Wachstum bei Individuen aus Menschenobhut und freier Wildbahn belegt fur Panther- (Geochelone pardalis), Sporen- (G. sulcata), Griechische (Testudo hermanni) und Maurische (T. graeca) Landschildkroten. Solche hohen Wachstumsraten werden traditionell als Gesundheitsproblem betrachtet. Im Falle des 18 Jahre umfassenden Datensatzes zu G. sulcata konnte gezeigt werden, dass ein schnelles Wachstum zu einer raschen sexuellen Reife fuhrt, so wie man es aufgrund des Umkehrpunktes der Wachstumskurve erwartet. Bei einer retrospektiven Auswertung von 539 Schildkroten-Patienten der Universitat Zurich wurde kein Hinweis dafur gefunden, dass fur ihr Alter schwere Tiere eher zu futterungs- oder wachstumsbedingten Problemen neigen. Solche Probleme traten aber haufiger bei jungeren Tieren auf, was darauf hinweisen konnte, dass Tiere mit solchen Problemen nicht alt werden. Schildkroten intensiv zu futtern konnte eine Strategie sein, um die Generationszeiten in Nachzuchtprogrammen zu verkurzen. Ob hohe Wachstumsraten wirklich die Gesundheit gefahrden, muss in kontrollierten klinischen Studien untersucht werden. Die Ergebnisse legen nahe, dass man Schildkroten – auch mit adaquaten Futterrationen – restriktiv futtern muss, wenn man die Bedingungen in freier Wildbahn imitieren will.

AB  - AUGUST METEORS.—In consequence of the brightness of the moon during the earlier portion of this month, only the more brilliant members of the Perseid swarm of meteors are likely to be observed. These meteors originate, as their name indicates, from a point situated in the constellation of Perseus near the star η, which lies in the north-eastern part of the heavens, and is rather low down during the earlier portion of the evening. As the maximum is usually attained on the 10th of the month, the moon should not prove such a disturbing factor; and if the night be fine, observers should make a point of recording their observations in a manner which has been described by Mr. Denning. It is only in this way that observations can be properly discussed and made to serve a useful end. Mr. Denning has recently (Knowledge, August 1) published an ephemeris of the position of the radiant point, and below we give an abstract which may prove useful for the present return.

AB  - Babcock's leopard tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis babcocki) are taken to rehabilitation centers in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa, because they are either escaped, unwanted, or confiscated pets, or else are confiscated from persons who acquire them illegally from the wild. South African rehabilitation centers are reluctant to euthanize tortoises, and there are few tortoise sanctuaries. Consequently, the local conservation authority, Ezemvelo KwaZulu- Natal Wildlife, developed a release protocol based on International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources guidelines, to facilitate the release of rehabilitated S. p. babcocki into the wild. The present study was done to determine whether rehabilitated animals could be successfully released into the wild, judged by whether individuals were able to survive in the wild. Seventeen apparently healthy individuals, with longer than 100-mm carapace length, that had been in captivity for more than 2 months in a large rehabilitation center were released into the wild. These rehabilitated animals, with attached radiotelemeters, were hard-released at 2 different sites within the historical range of the species and were monitored over a year. One of the tortoises was returned to captivity because of disease, 3 were killed intentionally or accidentally by humans, one died probably due to being turned over by another animal, 3 others died from a combination of disease, starvation and/or dehydration, and the fate of 6 was unknown. Because only 2 animals survived 13 months after release at one of the sites and only one was known to have survived 25 months after release at the other site, rehabilitated S. p. babcocki were not successfully released into the wild. However, recommendations to improve the probability of success of future releases of rehabilitated S. p. babcocki into the wild are provided.

AB  - We tested samples from 1,015 chelonians in Europe for Mycoplasma spp., herpesviruses, ranaviruses, picornaviruses, and ferlaviruses by PCR. Mycoplasma spp. were detected in 42.1% and herpesviruses were detected in 8.0% of tested chelonians. Differentiation of the herpesviruses revealed that 46.9% of the detected chelonian viruses were testudinid herpesvirus 1 (TeHV-1) and 54.3% were TeHV-3, including co-detections of TeHV-1 and -3 in 3 tortoises. TeHV-4 was detected in a leopard tortoise ( Stigmochelys pardalis), and a herpesvirus that could not be further characterized was found in a pond slider ( Trachemys scripta). Picornaviruses (topiviruses) were detected in 2.2% of the tested animals; ferlaviruses were found in 0.6%; no ranaviruses were detected in any of the animals tested. Mycoplasma spp. were detected significantly more often in Horsfield's tortoises ( Testudo horsfieldii), leopard tortoises, and Indian star tortoises ( Geochelone elegans) than in other species. Horsfield's tortoises were also significantly more often positive for TeHV-1. Mycoplasma and TeHV-1 were co-detected in 3.0%, and mycoplasma and TeHV-3 in 2.3%. The TeHV-4-positive tortoise was also positive for mycoplasma. Mycoplasma and picornaviruses were co-detected in 1.2% of the tortoises. A spur-thighed tortoise ( Testudo graeca) was positive for mycoplasma and a ferlavirus. In some cases, >2 pathogens were detected. A significant correlation between mycoplasma and herpesvirus detection was found. Of all tested animals, 47.6% were positive for at least one pathogen, demonstrating the importance of pathogen detection in captive chelonians.

AB  - Growth rings were measured in dead African leopard tortoises, Geochelone pardalis, collected in the seasonal tropics of Zimbabwe over an 11-year period. A series of Ford-Walford plots using growth measured from annuli showed that growth fitted a logistic by mass curve best, logistic by length and Gompertz curves less well, and a Bertalanffy curve least well. The Bertalanffy curve, often fitted to growth of chelonians, is characterised by particularly high growth rates of juveniles compared with larger individuals. It is suggested that this growth pattern is likely to be found in species showing a marked decrease in diet quality with size. This hypothesis is supported by a review of growth patterns in chelonians: Bertalanffy curves are associated with an omnivorous (and thus potentially variable) diet and other growth patterns with an obligate carnivorous or herbivorous diet. Geochelone pardalis in Zimbabwe showed significant sexual size dimorphism, the mean asymptotic mass of females being 1.7 times that ...

AB  - Energy metabolism varies considerably between different groups of endotherms, yet there is little or no reported variation among extant groups of reptiles. We measured lower resting metabolic rates (RMRs) in Kalahari tent tortoises (Psammobates oculiferus) than in sympatric Leopard tortoises (Geochelone pardalis). G. pardalis also had RMR values that were higher than the allometric prediction for reptiles whereas P. oculiferus had RMR values that were not significantly different from the prediction. Differences in RMR between the two species may have occurred because of the large differences in body mass, differing body temperatures, differences in growth rates, or because there may have been differences in the heat increment of feeding.

AB  - Behavioural and physiological thermoregulation were studied in Chersina angulata, Homopus areolatus and Geochelone pardalis. Results on behavioural thermoregulation (response to thermal gradient) suggest it to be of greatest significance in H. areolatus. Physiological thermoregulation was studied in terms of individual capacities to control thermal conductance. All three species showed definite capacities to thermo- regulate by altering conductance. H. areolatus appears to possess greatest physiological control of conductance and has a higher maximum preferred temperature than the other two species studied. Large specimens of G. pardalis show little physiological control of heat flux and this decreases with increasing size. C. angulata has a greater degree of control over conductance than G. pardalis. It is concluded that size alone can not explain all the different thermoregulatory characteristics. The study demonstrates the need for a holistic theory of physiology and ecology of thermoregulation in tort...

AB  - SOME interesting observations on underground temperature have recently been made at Cremorne, near Port Jackson, in New South Wales. 1 The bore is 2939 feet deep, the mean temperature at the surface is 63° F., and the temperature at the depth of 2733 feet was found to be 97° F. The observations having been made with great care, the resulting gradient of 1° F. per 80 feet would appear to be “a good approximation to the truth.” The rocks of the district down to a depth of about 3000 feet consist of sandstones, shales and conglomerates, and therefore, so far as conductivity is concerned, seem to be not unlike the rocks penetrated by the shafts of coal-mines in the north of England, or those in which Forbes' rock-thermometers were sunk in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh.

In den von einer erkrankten Schildkrote entnommenen Proben konnten mittels PCR Mykoplasmen und ein Herpesvirus nachgewiesen werden. Die Sequenzierung eines Teils des DNA-Polymerase-Gens des Herpesvirus ergab eine 99%ige Ubereinstimmung mit dem Testudinid-Herpesvirus Typ 4, das bisher nur einmal bei einer Afrikanischen Schnabelbrustschildkrote (Chersina angulata) in den USA nachgewiesen wurde.

AB  - ABSTRACT Twenty immobilizations, for various minor clinical procedures, were performed on 12 adult and sub-adult leopard, Geochelone pardalis, yellow foot, Geochelone denticulata, and Aldabra, Aldabrachelys gigantea, tortoises with a combination of medetomidine and ketamine. An intravenous dose rate of 100 μg/kg medetomidine for leopard and yellow foot tortoises and 25 - 80 μg/kg for Aldabra tortoises resulted in induction times (time from drug injection until the head could be pulled out and the mouth opened) that ranged between 4 and 16 minutes (median 10) and 15 - 45 minutes (45) respectively. Recovery times (time from drug injection until the tortoise was able to withdraw its head with strength) using intravenous atipamezole at a dose rate of 400 μg/kg for leopard and yellow foot and 100 - 380 μg/kg for Aldabra tortoises ranged between 2 and 30 minutes (5) and 5 - 15 minutes (5) respectively. Most (90%) of leopard and yellow foot tortoises experienced a drop in heart rate from baseline following medet...

AB  - Leopard tortoise Geochelone pardalis faeces collected in rocky habitats in the southern Karoo contained at least 75 species of grasses, succulents and forbs belonging to 26 plant families. Soft, green plants were broken down by digestion but twigs, thorns and fibrous naterials were not digested. Flowers, fruits and seeds made up 67% of 356 identified plant fragments. Germination trials demonstrated that leopard tortoises could disperse viable seeds of Aizoaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Crassulaceae, Cyperaceae, Fabaceae, Poaceae and Scrophulariaceae.

AB  - Observations were made of growth rate and variation in colour pattern of the leopard tortoise (Geochelone pardalis babcocki) in northern Tanzania between October 1993 and June 1996. Growth rate differed significantly between tortoises, with immature animals (6.9 ± 1.4 mm month−1) and females (5.7 ± 1.3 mm month−1) exhibiting higher rates of growth than adult animals (2.9 ± 0.8 mm month−1) and males (3.2 ± 1.1 mm month−1), respectively. The faster growth rate in immature animals suggested that growth rate declined with age. The difference in growth rates between the sexes was ascribed to sexual dimorphism, adult females being larger and therefore growing faster than males.



The carapacial colour pattern observed in the northern Tanzanian tortoises was generally similar to that described elsewhere in the species' range. The colour pattern varied between Arusha and Serengeti District tortoises. Animals at the Arusha sites tended to be sparsely coloured (55.6%) compared to the Serengeti tortoises, which had a buff colouration with radiating spots (89.3%).; The sparse colouration provides effective camouflage in the drier Arusha habitats, as does the buff colouration with black spots in the wetter, darker habitats in the Serengeti.



On a fait des observations du taux de croissance et des variations des dessins de couleurs de la tortue leopard (Geochelone pardalis babcocki), entre octobre 1993 et juin 1996, dans le nord de la Tanzanie. Le taux de croissance etait significativement different selon les tortues, les animaux immatures (6,9 ± 1,4 mm/mois) et les femelles (5,7 ± 1,3 mm/mois) presentant des taux de croissance plus eleves que les animaux adultes (2,9 ± 0,8 mm/mois) et les mâles (3,2  ± 1,1 mm/mois), respectivement. Le taux de croissance plus rapide chez les immatures suggerait que le taux de croissance diminue avec l'âge. La difference de taux de croissance entre les sexes a ete attribuee au dimorphisme sexuel, les femelles adultes etant plus grandes et donc grandissant plus vite que les mâles.



Le schema colore de la carapace observe chez les tortues du nord de la Tanzanie etait generalement semblable a celui qui est decrit ailleurs dans l'aire de distribution de l'espece. Le dessin colore variait entre les tortues du District d'Arusha et celles du District de Serengeti. Les animaux d'Arusha avaient tendance aetre peu colores (55,6%), compares aux tortues du Serengeti qui avaient une coloration chamois avec des taches en etoile (89,3%). La faible coloration constitue un camouflage efficace dans les habitats plus secs d'Arusha, comme l'est la coloration beige avec des taches noires dans les habitats plus humides et plus sombre du Serengeti

AB  - Entamoeba invadens is a protozoal parasite of reptiles that causes colitis, abscesses of liver and other organs, and sometimes acute death. It is generally considered a commensal of chelonians but has also been implicated as a cause of colitis, diarrhea, and death in gopher (Gopherus polyphemus) and leopard (Geochelone pardalis) tortoises. Diagnosis of E. invadens is currently by detection of trophozoites and/or cysts upon direct fecal examination. However, definitive diagnosis of E. invadens has been difficult due to the very similar morphology of nonpathogenic Entamoeba spp., including E. ranarum, E. insolita, E. barreti, and E. terrapinae. Definitive speciation of Entamoeba spp. is important to avoid misdiagnosis or overtreatment for nonpathogenic protozoa. It is also important for consideration of mixed species reptile collections to avoid exposing snakes and lizards to E. invadens. In this study, we developed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers for E. invadens, E. ranarum, E. terrapinae, and E. insolita and conducted PCR amplification of purified DNA from cell cultures, as well as purified DNA from reptile stool samples with E. invadens trophozoites added. As a result of this study, a naturally occurring infection of E. invadens was confirmed in a giant South American river turtle (Podocnemis expansa). This study has developed successful PCR primers for four species of Entamoeba and demonstrates that PCR is a promising diagnostic tool for the definitive identification of E. invadens.

AB  - Perivitelline membrane (PVM)-bound sperm detection has recently been incorporated into avian breeding programs to assess egg fertility, confirm successful copulation, and to evaluate male reproductive status and pair compatibility. Due to the similarities between avian and chelonian egg structure and development, and because fertility determination in chelonian eggs lacking embryonic growth is equally challenging, PVM-bound sperm detection may also be a promising tool for the reproductive management of turtles and tortoises. This study is the first to successfully demonstrate the use of PVM-bound sperm detection in chelonian eggs. Recovered membranes were stained with Hoechst 33342 and examined for sperm presence using fluorescence microscopy. Sperm were positively identified for up to 206 days post-oviposition, following storage, diapause, and/or incubation, in 52 opportunistically collected eggs representing 12 species. However, advanced microbial infection frequently hindered the ability to detect membrane-bound sperm. Fertile Centrochelys sulcata, Manouria emys, and Stigmochelys pardalis eggs were used to evaluate the impact of incubation and storage on the ability to detect sperm. Storage at -20°C or in formalin were found to be the best methods for egg preservation prior to sperm detection. Additionally, sperm-derived mtDNA was isolated and PCR amplified from Astrochelys radiata, C. sulcata, and S. pardalis eggs. PVM-bound sperm detection has the potential to substantially improve studies of artificial incubation and sperm storage, and could be used to evaluate the success of artificial insemination in chelonian species. Mitochondrial DNA from PVM-bound sperm has applications for parentage analysis, the study of sperm competition, and potentially species identification.

AB  - Cases of femoral head and neck excision arthroplasty are infrequently reported in reptiles, and details of surgical technique and clinical outcome in chelonia are lacking. An adult female leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis) was presented with chronic non-weight-bearing lameness of the left hind limb. Examination and radiography were consistent with coxofemoral luxation, and as a result of the chronic presentation, surgical intervention was recommended. A cranial approach to the joint via the prefemoral fossa afforded good surgical exposure. A depressed lytic acetabular lesion was noted during the procedure, postulated to be a result of abnormal wear from the luxated femoral head. A fiberglass prop was used during recovery to allow extension of the limb without full weight-bearing. Lameness persisted postoperatively, but limb usage significantly improved.

AB  - Background Hematologic and plasma biochemical evaluations are routinely used in evaluating the chelonian patient, but appropriate processing techniques have been minimally defined. Objectives This study was designed to compare the effects of temperature, time, anticoagulant, and species on sodium and potassium values in the Aldabra tortoise (Geochelone gigantea) and the Burmese mountain tortoise (Manouria emys). Methods Blood samples from 7 Aldabra tortoises and 8 Burmese mountain tortoises were collected into tubes without anticoagulant and tubes containing lithium heparin. Sodium and potassium concentrations were measured by flame photometry in serum and plasma harvested immediately after collection and from aliquots of whole blood stored at 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C for 5 to 120 minutes. Results In Aldabra tortoises, storage time and temperature had no significant effect on potassium concentrations in heparinized blood and in blood without anticoagulant. However, sodium concentrations in serum and plasma decreased significantly in samples without anticoagulant stored at 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C and in heparinized samples stored at 4 degrees C. In Burmese mountain tortoises, potassium concentrations in serum and plasma increased significantly with time in samples without anticoagulant and in heparinized samples stored at 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C, but the increases were less at 4 degrees C. Sodium concentrations in serum and plasma decreased significantly in blood without anticoagulant and heparinized blood stored at 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C. Conclusions Storage of blood samples with and without anticoagulant at 4 degrees C significantly improved the stability of potassium and sodium concentrations in both species of tortoises. Early separation of red cells from serum or plasma after blood collection is especially important to ensure the reliability of potassium measurements.

AB  - In 1973 the Convention in International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) was called to life as to regulate the international wildlife trade, and to prevent species becoming (economically and biologically) extinct. The trade in freshwater turtles and tortoises in Asia is so huge that it threatens the survival of many species. In 2006 and 2007, during three surveys at Chatuchak market in Bangkok, Thailand, we recorded a significant trade in non-native CITES-listed freshwater tur tles and tortoises to be used as pets. We documented a total of 688 individuals of 19 species from different regions of the world, many of which are globally threatened with extinction. Most commonly recorded were three species of tortoise from Madagascar and Africa, i.e. Radiated Tortoise Geochelone radiata, Spurred Tortoise G. sulcata and Leopard Tortoise G. pardalis. Five species were listed on CITES Appendix I, precluding all international trade, and an additional six Appendix II or III-listed species that can be traded albeit regulated, were not registered as being imported into Thailand in the last six year. CITES I-listed species were not more expensive than CITES II or III listed species, nor was there a relationship between retail price and numbers of turtles observed. The large number and availability of illegally sourced animals indicates a blatant disregard for law and authority by traders both from Thailand and from exporting countries. We conclude that the trade in these species, in such significant volumes, is of serious conservation concern, and in order for CITES to be more effective it is imperative that Parties recognize the scale of the international trade in freshwater turtles and tortoises, and respond accordingly.

AB  - The Mugger crocodile is the second largest crocodile in Sri Lanka. Recently we observed a Mugger attacking an unidentified radiated tortoise. The body morphology and colouration of this particular tortoise appeared different to the native Star tortoise widely distributed in the country. Thus, the possibility of an escaped or released exotic pet is discussed.

AB  - To date, four intraerythrocytic apicomplexans, namely the haemogregarines Haemogregarina fitzsimonsi and Haemogregarina parvula, and the haemoproteids Haemoproteus testudinalis and Haemoproteus natalensis, have been described from South African land tortoises. Recently, an intraleucocytic haemogregarine was observed in one species of tortoise, Stigmochelys pardalis, from the province of KwaZulu-Natal. Gamonts were identified in the monocytes and lymphocytes of 5/126 (4%) S. pardalis, but no additional stages were detected. Mixed infections with H. fitzsimonsi were observed for 2/5 (40%) of the parasitized S. pardalis, but the intraleucocytic gamont stages were larger than the intraerythrocytic gamont stages of both H. fitzsimonsi and H. parvula. The only other record of a chelonian intraleucocytic haemogregarine is of Haemogregarina pseudemydis, with stages described from the red and white blood cells of neotropical terrapins. Thus, the report of an intraleucocytic haemogregarine infecting a terrestrial tortoise from Africa is significant, although its taxonomic placement remains problematic at present.

AB  - Testudines are a group of reptiles characterized by the presence of a shell covered by keratinous shields. Stigmochelys pardalis is the most widely distributed terrestrial testudine in southern Africa. Although relatively common with some life history traits being well known, the growth of this species has yet to be studied in any detail. The bone microanatomy of this clade differs from that found in other amniotes, where terrestrial species tend to display characteristics normally seen in aquatic species and vice versa. A detailed histological analysis of the limb bones of S. pardalis reveals extensive variation through ontogeny. Cortical bone becomes increasingly thicker through ontogeny and is finally resorbed in the late sub-adult stage, resulting in a thin cortex and a large infilled medullary cavity. The predominant bone tissues are parallel-fibred and lamellar-zonal for the forelimbs and hind limbs respectively. The oldest individual displayed an External Fundamental System indicating that the growth rate had decreased substantially by this stage. Variability is prevalent between the forelimb and hind limb as well as between early and late sub-adults Forelimb elements exhibit characteristics such as faster growing parallel-fibered bone tissue, slightly higher vascularization and a predominance of annuli over Lines of Arrested Growth (LAG) compared to the hind limb which exhibits poorly vascularized, slower growing lamellar-zonal bone interrupted by LAGs. These differences indicate that the forelimb grew more rapidly than the hind limb, possibly due to the method of locomotion seen in terrestrial species. The extensive bone resorption that occurs from the early sub-adult stage destroys much of the primary cortex and results in a significantly different ratio of inner and outer bone diameter (p = 3.59 × 10--5; df = 28.04) as well as compactness (p = 2.91 × 10--5; df = 31.27) between early and late sub-adults. The extensive bone resorption seen also destroys the ecological signal and infers an aquatic lifestyle for this species despite it being clearly terrestrial. This supports the results of other studies that have found that using bone microanatomy to determine lifestyle in testudines does not produce accurate results.

AB  - Under recent regulatory designation of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) occurring east and south of the Colorado River constitute the Sonoran population, whereas those to the west and north form the Mojave population. These management units, distinguished by significant genetic, morphometric, and ecological differences, represent deep phylogenetic subdivisions within G. agassizii and are of high conservation value. We provide genetic and morphological profiles for an unusual tortoise population inhabiting the Black Mountains of Arizona, some 40 km east of the Colorado River. Both mitochondrial (mt) DNA and morphometric analyses revealed predominately Mojavean features: ten of eleven Black Mountain tortoises possessed Mojave mtDNA markers, and 24 of 37 animals exhibited Mojave morphometric phenotypes. Our results indicate west-to-east movement of tortoises across the Col- orado River, though how or when a Mojave lineage became established in the Black Mountains is difficult to ascertain. Active dispersal, river meander, and human transport (early or modem peoples) serve as plau- sible explanations. Future management of the Black Mountain tortoises should emphasize the population's Mojavean affinities.

You will notice that signs asking you to 'Please drive carefully' have been placed in the garden as well as 30 km/h speed limit signs. This is because the garden is a haven for three tortoise species, the Angulate Tortoise, also commonly known as the Bowsprit Tortoise or Rooipens (Chersina angulata), the Leopard Tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis subsp. pardalis) and the seldom seen Parrot-beaked Tortoise or Padloper (Homopus areolatus).

AB  - Ranaviral disease in amphibians has been studied intensely during the last decade, as associated mass-mortality events are considered to be a global threat to wild animal populations. Several studies have also included other susceptible ectothermic vertebrates (fish and reptiles), but only very few cases of ranavirus infections in lizards have been previously detected. In this study, we focused on clinically suspicious lizards and tested these animals for the presence of ranaviruses. Virological screening of samples from lizards with increased mortality and skin lesions over a course of four years led to the detection of ranaviral infections in seven different groups. Affected species were: brown anoles (Anolis sagrei), Asian glass lizards (Dopasia gracilis), green anoles (Anolis carolinensis), green iguanas (Iguana iguana), and a central bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps). Purulent to ulcerative-necrotizing dermatitis and hyperkeratosis were diagnosed in pathological examinations. All animals tested positive for the presence of ranavirus by PCR and a part of the major capsid protein (MCP) gene of each virus was sequenced. Three different ranaviruses were isolated in cell culture. The analyzed portions of the MCP gene from each of the five different viruses detected were distinct from one another and were 98.4-100% identical to the corresponding portion of the frog virus 3 (FV3) genome. This is the first description of ranavirus infections in these five lizard species. The similarity in the pathological lesions observed in these different cases indicates that ranaviral infection may be an important differential diagnosis for skin lesions in lizards.

AB  - The leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis) is the largest of southern Africa’s 13 tortoise species, and occurs in a variety of habitats from arid and semi-arid areas to mesic grassveld, savanna and bushveld. Seasonal activity patterns of S. pardalis were investigated as a function of rainfall, sex, time of day, temperature and time after sunrise on farmland in the semi-arid Nama-Karoo, South Africa. We predicted that because of seasonal rainfall, and subsequent increase in the food available, activity patterns of leopard tortoises would vary greatly among seasons, but that the primary constraint on activity levels within a season would be ambient temperature. Type of activity, time of day that the activity was performed, and the frequency that each activity was performed, differed among seasons. There was no overall seasonal difference in the level of activity with sex, but in certain seasons and with regard to specific activities, there were significant differences between the sexes. Diel activity was primarily bimodal in summer and autumn, and unimodal in winter and spring, with nonthermoregulatory activities being performed primarily in the afternoon. There was a positive correlation between number of tortoises caught and rainfall per season, but activity levels and number of tortoises walking and feeding was not correlated with seasonal rainfall. Leopard tortoise activity behaviours responded to ambient temperature, but results indicate that activity is also initiated by the time since sunrise.

AB  - ABSTRACT A total of 52 chelonians (50 Geochelone pardalis, and a Chersina angulata and Pelomedusa subrufa were killed along an electrified fence in the Thomas Baines Nature Reserve, Eastern Cape. To prevent such high mortality it is recommended that the fence be maintained at a minimum height of 250 mm and it should operate intermittently, allowing time for tortoises to retreat.

AB  - Heartwater is a tick-borne infectious disease caused by the rickettsial organism Cowdria ruminantium, currently Ehrlichia ruminantium. It poses an imminent threat to the Western Hemisphere, where it could cause mortality in cattle and other ruminant livestock in excess of 70%. It has been reported in the Caribbean; and its vector, Amblyomma sparsum, has been found on imported African spurred tortoises (Geochelone sulcata) and leopard tortoises (Geochelone pardalis) in southern Florida in the United States, leading to an importation ban on these reptiles. Symptoms have not been previously reported in reptiles. Here, we report peracute and acute deaths in African vipers imported from Africa through Florida. Signs included vomiting mucoid fluid, diarrhea, emaciation, convulsions, and death. Postmortem showed few gross lesions. The most consistent peracute and acute lesions were the pulmonary lesions and pericarditis with considerable bloody fluid in the pericardial sac (hydropericardium). These lesions strongly resembled the lesions of heartwater and a coccobacillus of less than 1-micron diameter was isolated in viper cell culture. The outbreak was brought to a halt by tick control and treatment of all exposed snakes with tetracycline. This isolation, tetracycline sensitivity, clinical signs, preliminary results with polymerase chain reaction of pCS20 ORF, and the viper preference of the disease may indicate a Cowdria-related attenuated species that has adapted to infect reptiles or an emerging new form of this group of microbes.

AB  - 1. Periods of breath-holding are interrupted by episodes of continuous breathing in the aquatic turtle Pelomedusa subrufa, whereas single breaths and short periods of breath-holding alternate in the terrestrial tortoise Testudo pardalis. This implies that partial pressures of O2 and CO2 in expired air are stable in Testudo in contrast to cyclic fluctuations in Pelomedusa. 2. In spite of this, air convection requirements (VA/VO2, ml BTPS/ml STPD) are not significantly different for the two species (25.4 in Testudo, 27.3 in Pelomedusa), and differences in weight-specific ventilation between the mean body weight. 3. The end-tidal PCO2 in Pelomedusa (mean 15.2 mmHg) is lower than in Testudo (mean 24.7 mmHg), which reflects aquatic CO2 elimination in Pelomedusa. 4. In Testudo, the time course of ventilation correlates with the time course of increase of end-tidal PCO2 during CO2 breathing, but no simple relationship is evident between ventilation and blood PCO2 in Pelomedusa. 5. In both species tidal volume as well as respiratory frequency increase approximately in proportion to the end-tidal PCO2, although the response to 6% CO2 breathing could be less than expected from extrapolation of the responses to 2 and 4% CO2. Both species also increase ventilation during hypoxia, but hyperoxia depresses ventilation.

AB  - THE NATAL OBSERVATORY.—Mr. Nevill's report upon the work of the Natal Observatory, during the fiscal year ending last June, has been issued. The staff of the Observatory consists of an astronomical assistant, a meteorological assistant, and a computor, all of them ladies. In spite of such limited assistance, much important work has been accomplished. The observations of Mars during the opposition of 1892 have been completely reduced; and as soon as the corresponding observations made at the northern observatories have been reduced and published, it is proposed to compare the two series, and obtain from them a new determination of the distance of the sun. A contribution to the knowledge of the variation of latitude is included in the report. Since 1884 a number of observations have been made, by Talcott's method, to determine the latitude of the observatory. The observations invite consideration, on account of the fact that they were made and reduced before any special attention had been directed to the variation, arising from the suspected periodical inequality, in the direction of the polar axis of the earth. The mean latitude, deduced from the 1023 observations made during the six years 1884–1890, was 29° 51′ 46″˙68. The results obtained, from the separate observations of each year, show a steady gradual decrease since 1885. The observed latitude of the Observatory seems to have reached a maximum in that year, and to have steadily decreased since, at a nearly uniform rate of 0″˙27 per annum. The rate of decrease up to 1890, however, appears to have quickly diminished, indicating a periodical irregularity in the apparent value of the latitude of the Observatory. Mr. Nevill remarks that a great deal of important work has accumulated at the Observatory, but the Government of Natal will not afford the necessary facilities for printing and publishing it.

AB  - Behavioural and physiological thermoregulation were studied in Chersina angulata, Homopus areolatus and Geochelone pardalis. Results on behavioural thermoregulation (response to thermal gradient) suggest it to be of greatest significance in H. areolatus. Physiological thermoregulation was studied in terms of individual capacities to control thermal conductance. All three species showed definite capacities to thermoregulate by altering conductance. H. areolatus appears to possess greatest physiological control of conductance and has a higher maximum preferred temperature than the other two species studied. Large specimens of G. pardalis show little physiological control of heat flux and this decreases with Increasing size. C. angulata has a greater degree of control over conductance than G. pardalis. It is concluded that size alone can not explain all the different thermoregulatory characteristics. The study demonstrates the need for a holistic theory of physiology and ecology of thermoregulation in tortoises.

AB  - Most of the 42 living species of tortoise (Testudinidae) are herbivorous, feeding largely on vascular plants, with the exception of the genus Kinixys, which is omnivorous. A comparison of Kinixys spekii and Geochelone pardalis showed the following significant differences. The large intestine was shorter in K. spekii (86% of plastron length and 1.8% of body mass) than in G. pardalis (246 and 2.5%) and held a smaller proportion of the total gut contents (44 and 62%, respectively). The apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) of organic matter was lower in K. spekii (77%) than in G. pardalis (82%) fed kale; the ADC of holocellulose was higher and did not differ between the two species. Kinixys spekii did not readily consume grass, which is more difficult to digest than kale; the ADC of organic matter was 64% in G. pardalis. The time to first excretion (t0) was lower in K. spekii (2.2 days) than in G. pardalis (3.8 days). Other measures of retention time (t50, tmax, and ) did not differ between the species, o...

AB  - growth of Escherichia coli was recovered from a sample of fluid aspirated from the abdominal cavity. A sample of heparinised blood taken before surgery had a haematocrit of 26 per cent, but was unsuitable for a full haematology profile because of clotting during collection. A blood smear showed toxic changes in the heterophils and an increased proportion of monocytes. Plasma biochemistry revealed concentrations of calcium of 2·3 mmol/l (reference range in eight captive adults 2·3 to 3·5 mmol/l), phosphate of 1·3 mmol/l (reference range 0·2 to 0·4 mmol/l) and uric acid of 264 μmol/l (reference range 71 to 95 μmol/l) (McArthur and others 2004). The tortoise underwent a laparotomy, during which a ruptured egg was removed from the abdomen and an ovariohysterectomy was performed, but the tortoise died the following day. At postmortem examination, the intestinal tract was distended with gas and had light brown, floccular, fluid contents. There were multiple, 1 to 3 mm diameter, pale yellow, granular plaques on the mucosa of the small intestine and colon. The serosal surface of the small intestine had several 5 to 10 mm diameter, dark blue areas with irregular, red borders. The lungs were oedematous and there was pale yellow, viscous, purulent material in the lumina of the bronchi. Histologically, the intestinal mucosa exhibited severe segmental ulceration and necrosis, with haemorrhage, infiltration by heterophils and accumulation of cellular debris on the mucosal surface, forming a necrotic pseudomembrane. There was increased secretion of mucus. Flask-shaped ulcers with mucoid exudate, similar to those in case 1, were observed in some sections (Fig 2a). Trophozoites resembling E invadens had invaded the mucosa at the base of the necrotic inflammatory plaques and Amoebic enterocolitis and acute myonecrosis in leopard tortoises (Geochelone pardalis)

AB  - To date, only a single species of Hemolivia, Hemolivia mauritanica (Sergent & Sergent, 1904), has been described from African terrestrial tortoises. Although various haemogregarines have been described from southern African terrapins and tortoises, including species from the genus Haemogregarina and one from the genus Hepatozoon, no species of Hemolivia have been identified previously from southern Africa. Since its morphological redescription, the taxonomic placement of one of these species, Haemogregarina parvula Dias, 1953, was in doubt. Hence, research was undertaken to resolve the true taxonomic position of this haemogregarine. Blood smears from nine wild tortoises of two species, Stigmochelys pardalis and Kinixys zombensis, from South Africa were screened, with the focus on H. parvula. Parasite DNA was extracted from ethanol-preserved blood samples, and fragments of the 18S rDNA gene were amplified by PCR using the primer sets HepF300/HepR900 and 4558/2733.

AB  - A series of interesting and important research findings on cowdriosis have stimulated and renewed widespread interest in this disease. The most important development is the successful in-vitro cultivation of different stocks of the microorganism in bovine endothelial cell and goat neutrophil cultures. In-vitro cultivation opens many new avenues of research that should lead, not only to a better understanding of the bacterium, but also to the development of diagnostic methods and practical safe methods of immunization. The identification of new potential tick vectors and non-ruminant hosts, such as the guinea-fowl, scrub hare, and leopard tortoise, emphasizes the complexity of the epidemiology of the disease. Recent isolates of murinotropic stocks of Cowdria ruminantium have proved to be very suitable for studying the infectivity of tissue cultures and freeze-dried material, as well as for the screening of new drugs for specific or supportive treatment of heartwater disease. Since there is no cross-protection between various stocks of C. ruminantium, the selection of a single stock of the microorganism for the development of a vaccine is unlikely. Although distinct serotypes were found in the genus Cowdria, the serological cross-reactions between C. ruminantium and certain members of the genus Ehrlichia emphasizes the close relationship that exists between these two genera. Serological cross-reactions between the genera also complicate interpretation of epidemiologic data of heartwater disease. The recent world-wide surge of research on C. ruminantium will undoubtedly greatly enhance our knowledge of heartwater disease.

AB  - CELESTIAL PHOTOGRAPHY BY SIMPLE MEANS.—In the hands of Prof. Barnard, the “magic lantern” lens has developed into an instrument of considerable astronomical importance. The lens actually employed by him is a 1½ inch doublet of 4 or 5 inches equivalent focus, and the scale of the pictures is roughly 10° to an inch. Six beautiful photographs of various parts of the Milky Way taken with this small optical aid are reproduced in the Astrophysical Journal, vol. ii. No. 5, and they admirably illustrate the value of such an instrument in the delineation of extended nebulosities and in photographing large areas of the sky. They are selected from the more remarkable parts of the Milky Way, but Prof. Barnard has obtained a great number of such photographs, and proposes soon to construct a photographic chart from them. The picture of the new nebulous region in Scorpio shows two very obvious streams or “dark lanes” which are almost void of stars, and various peculiarities are presented by the other photographs.

AB  - Pulmonary ventilation and perfusion have been measured directly in unanaesthetized turtles (Pelomedusa subrufa) and tortoises (Testudo pardalis) during normal air breathing and during the inspiration of both hypoxic and hypercapnic gases. Lung ventilation in air was intermittent in both species and particularly in the turtle was accompanied by transient increases in pulmonary perfusion. Hypercapnia (4% CO2 in air) elicited a twofold to threefold increase in pulmonary perfusion but a sixfold increase in pulmonary ventilation in both species. Consequently the ventilation:perfusion ratio more than doubled in value. Unlike the hypercapnic responses, hypoxia (5% O2 in N2) increased pulmonary perfusion by two to five times but increased pulmonary ventilation by less than two times, and so the ventilation:perfusion ratio fell by one-half during hypoxic exposure. These data are interpreted in terms of intermittent breathing and processes of O2 and CO2 transport.

AB  - We studied the long-term response of a cohort of eight female Agassiz’s desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) during the first 15 years following a large fire at a wind energy generation facility near Palm Springs, California, USA. The fire burned a significant portion of the study site in 1995. Tortoise activity areas were mapped using minimum convex polygons for a proximate post-fire interval from 1997 to 2000, and a long-term post-fire interval from 2009 to 2010. In addition, we measured the annual reproductive output of eggs each year and monitored the body condition of tortoises over time. One adult female tortoise was killed by the fire and five tortoises bore exposure scars that were not fatal. Despite predictions that tortoises would make the short-distance movements from burned to nearby unburned habitats, most activity areas and their centroids remained in burned areas for the duration of the study. The percentage of activity area burned did not differ significantly between the two monitoring periods. Annual reproductive output and measures of body condition remained statistically similar throughout the monitoring period. Despite changes in plant composition, conditions at this site appeared to be suitable for survival of tortoises following a major fire. High productivity at the site may have buffered tortoises from the adverse impacts of fire if they were not killed outright. Tortoise populations at less productive desert sites may not have adequate resources to sustain normal activity areas, reproductive output, and body conditions following fire.

AB  - Exotic reptiles such as tortoises, have become increasingly common domestic pets worldwide and are known to host different gastrointestinal parasites. Some of these parasites bear zoonotic potential. In the present survey, we parasitologically examined tortoise faecal samples (n = 1005) from 19 different species held as pets in private German households and German zoological gardens. Saline faecal smears were used to generate prevalence data for potentially health-compromising gastrointestinal parasites. In addition, we performed complete parasitological dissections of dead tortoises (n = 49) to estimate endoparasite burdens precisely. Analysed tortoise faecal samples contained a broad spectrum of endoparasites. We detected ten taxa of endoparasites; oxyurid nematodes (e.g. Tachygonetria spp.) were the most prevalent parasites in faecal samples (43.18%), followed by ascarids (Angusticaecum spp.) (0.01%), Hexamita spp. (0.007%), Balantidium spp. (0.007%), trichomonads (0.004%), Strongyloides spp. (0.003%), Entamoeba spp. (0.005%), Hartmanella spp. (0.001%), Blastocystis spp. (0.002%), heterakids (0.001%) and Trimitus spp. (0.001%). Additionally, we investigated dead tortoise individuals (n = 49; of 10 different species) for aetiological diagnosis and estimation of endoparasite burden. Of these individuals, 38 (77.6%) were infected with parasites and 14 (28.6%) of them died most probably due to severe parasitic infection. Oxyurid infections correlated positively with calcium deficiency and metabolic bone disease (MBD) as well as nephrosis/nephritis, mainly occurring in juvenile tortoises (< 5 years of age). The saline faecal smear technique proved to be efficient in detecting different metazoan and protozoan parasite stages in tortoise faeces. The prevalence of oxyurid infections was particularly high. In combination with pathological findings in clinical oxyuridosis obtained from necropsied animals, our findings call for further, detailed investigations on pathogenesis and immunology of oxyurids in pet reptiles. Coprological analyses for parasite detection should be mandatory before tortoises are transferred to a new owner, animal group, or public and private enclosures such as zoos. We advocate for regular health screenings in pet tortoises and, if parasitic infections are diagnosed, adequate medication or alternative hygiene management should be considered to improve and maintain individual and population health.

AB  - Light/dark cycle affects the physiology of vertebrates and hypothalamic orexin neurons (ORX) are involved in this function. The breathing pattern of the green iguana changes from continuous to episodic across the light/dark phases. Since the stimulatory actions of ORX on breathing are most important during arousal, we hypothesized that ORX regulates changes of breathing pattern in iguanas. Thus, we: (1) Localized ORX neurons with immunohistochemistry; (2) Quantified cyclic changes in plasma orexin-A levels by ELISA; (3) Compared breathing pattern at rest and during hypoxia and hypercarbia; (4) Evaluated the participation of the ORX receptors in ventilation with intracerebroventricular microinjections of ORX antagonists during light and dark phases. We show that the ORX neurons of I. iguana are located in the periventricular hypothalamic nucleus. Orexin-A peaks during the light/active phase and breathing parallels these cyclic changes: ventilation is higher during the light phase than during the dark phase. However, inactivation of ORX-receptors does not affect the breathing pattern. Iguanas increase ventilation during hypoxia only during the light phase. Conversely, CO2 promotes post-hypercarbic hyperpnea during both phases. We conclude that ORXs potentiate the post-hypercarbic (but not the hypoxic)-drive to breathe and are not involved in light/dark changes in the breathing pattern.

AB  - Cladistic analyses of 26 selected cranial characters of Geochelone did not support the implications of previous classifications. Most subgenera do not share derived features and, thus, are not considered monophyletic. The subgenus Manouria (G. emys and G. impressa), although not monophyletic, is the most primitive group of Geochelone, because its members lack most derived features. Indotestudo (G. elongata and G. travancorica) may be monophyletic; all members possess a ridge extending from the base of the inferior processes of the parietals anterolaterally over the dorsal surfaces of the pterygoids and palatines to the external pterygoid processes. Possession of a short trachea suggests that the subgenus Indotestudo should not be allocated to the genus Geoche- lone. Aldabrachelys is certainly monophyletic by virtue of a shared derived vertically elongated external narial opening. Other subgenera (Chelonoidis, Geochelone, Asterochelys) have no shared derived characters. Possible relationships between G. (Geochelone) pardalis and G. (Asterochelys) yniphora and G. (Geochelone) elegans, G. (Aldabrachelys) gigantea and G. (Asterochelys) radiata are suggested by cladistic analyses, but must await examination of additional anatomical systems, inclusion and analyses of other tortoise genera, and consideration of functional hypotheses. Until such analyses are completed, the subgenera of living Geochelone should be abandoned.

AB  - While with the New York Zoological Society Galapagos Expedition of 1928, under the leadership of Dr. C. H. Townsend, (see Bulletin New York Zoological Society, Vol. XXXI, No. 5), I acquired the following information of this text from my native guide, an Ecuadorian settler called Garcia. On the long march back to the coast from the interior of volcano scarred southeastern Albemarle, food gave out. Tortoise were at hand and solved the immediate problem. Before killing the shelled reptiles, I asked about their sex, and subsequent examination of the generative organs and the cloaca completely checked the statements of my native guide. Van Denburgh in the "Gigantic Land Tortoises of the Galapagos Archipelago," published by the California Academy of Sciences, Vol. II, Part I, fourth series, speaks of the concave plastron often being seen in the males, and attests to the fact that the females are broader than the males. He also mentions that the lower jaw and throat in males is sometimes marked with yellow, in the species that we probably secured, Testudo giintheri Baur, the Villamil Mountain Tortoise. MALE

ISBN 9781536228359 $18.99 Reviewed from digital galleys R* 4-7 yrs Barbara Hendricks, a regular leopard tortoise, has entered a running race. She knows it’s not a great idea and she’s ready to back out, but her owner Lorraine believes in her and Barbara is willing to give it a go. Lorraine sets up a fitness routine, which basically consists of a daily walk, but Barbara sees no progress, outpaced by a worm, a toddler, an old man, and a racecar dinosaur. The day of the race arrives, and Barbara reluctantly goes, only to be horrified by her competition: a slug, a snail, a slow loris, a sloth, and a walrus—“the best of the best,” the fastest animals Barbara has ever seen. Will Barbara be able to keep up and maybe even win the fun run trophy? The race result might not matter for young listeners as they’ll likely be rolling with giggles at the sight of the grimly determined racers slowly—slowly—making their way across several pages of panels, each meeting their own challenge until the tortoise takes first place. The richly textured mixed-media art is vibrant, balancing bright pops of color in the foreground with more subtle hues in the setting, and bespectacled, slightly disheveled Lorraine makes a wonderfully expressive counterpoint to dour, clearly anxious Barbara. The try-your-best message is a familiar one, but it has an irreverent freshness here, especially in the closing pages as a triumphant Barbara sets to race a hare, giving viewers a chance to wonder if her newfound confidence will help her take on faster competition.

AB  - The preservation of spermatozoa is an important tool used in conservation programs to increase the genetic diversity of threatened and endangered species. Although routinely used to manage conservation programs for higher vertebrates, there have been limited attempts to establish reproductive assistance programs for tortoises. The purpose of this study was to develop a model for collecting and characterizing semen in Testudinidae. Semen was collected from 13/16 (81.2%, 95% CI: 62-100) adult male leopard tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis) via electroejaculation under propofol anesthesia. Semen samples were collected most frequently after the second series of electrostimulations (6/13, 46.1%), with fewer animals producing semen after the first (5/13, 38.5%) or third (2/13, 15.4%) electrostimulations. The average volume of a semen sample in the tortoises was 0.26 ml (standard deviation: 0.16, minimum-maximum: 0.1-0.6), the average spermatozoal concentration was 101.62 × 106/ml, and the average motility at time of collection was 57.3%. A rapid decrease in motility was observed in refrigerated samples over 24 h resulting in a median motility of 0% at 24 h post-collection. The results of this study suggest that electroejaculation is a safe and efficient method for collecting semen from leopard tortoises.

AB  - Sighting frequency and food habits of the leopard tortoise (Geochelone pardalis) were studied in northern Tanzania from October 1993 to June 1996. Sighting frequency varied significantly between protected (0.22 mhr−1) and unprotected sites (0.59 mhr−1), and between Arusha (0.27 mhr−1) and Serengeti sites (0.56 mhr−1).



The tortoise diet comprised mostly plants (97.8%) and rarely inorganic matter (2.2%). A total of 47 plant species from 21 families was eaten. Forbs made up 74.5% of the plant items and monocots the remainder. Succulents contributed 51.0% of the plant items eaten while grasses and legumes accounted for 16.8% and 13.5%, respectively. Some plant items were eaten more frequently than their occurrence in the habitats.

AB  - mRNA has become a new class of therapeutics and vaccines that possess high efficacy for the treatment and prevention of a variety of diseases. Recently, a team led by Professors Traverso and Langer, pioneers and leaders in the field of drug delivery and biomedical devices, reported the design and use of robotic pills for gastrointestinal-tract-targeted oral mRNA delivery, opening up a new avenue for the oral mRNA medicines. mRNA has become a new class of therapeutics and vaccines that possess high efficacy for the treatment and prevention of a variety of diseases. Recently, a team led by Professors Traverso and Langer, pioneers and leaders in the field of drug delivery and biomedical devices, reported the design and use of robotic pills for gastrointestinal-tract-targeted oral mRNA delivery, opening up a new avenue for the oral mRNA medicines. Nucleic-acid-based medicines, especially mRNA-based therapeutics and vaccines, have been shown to exhibit high efficacy in the treatment and prevention of a variety of diseases. The pivotal role of mRNA vaccines in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the great potential of mRNA-based medicines.1Jain S. Venkataraman A. Wechsler M.E. Peppas N.A. Messenger RNA-based vaccines: Past, present, and future directions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2021; 179: 114000Google Scholar This has stimulated the rapid development of various mRNA-based biomedical applications including vaccines, immunotherapy, gene editing, and functional protein restoration in tackling different diseases. Compared to conventional vaccines, mRNA vaccines have extraordinarily high efficacy and a much shorter development cycle, which is crucial for quickly slowing down the spread of highly contagious viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, which originally caused the COVID-19 pandemic. While the current mRNA medicines are predominantly administrated via intravenous or subcutaneous injection, novel mRNA medicines that can be administrated to patients by oral dosage forms are very much preferred.1Jain S. Venkataraman A. Wechsler M.E. Peppas N.A. Messenger RNA-based vaccines: Past, present, and future directions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2021; 179: 114000Google Scholar Recently, Abramson et al. demonstrated the possibility of the direct delivery of mRNA-loaded polymeric nanoparticles into the gastric submucosa via orally administrated robotic pills (Figure 1).2Abramson A. Kirtane A.R. Shi Y. Zhong G. Collins J.E. Tamang S. Ishida K. Hayward A. Wainer J. Rajesh N.U. et al.Oral mRNA delivery using capsule-mediated gastrointestinal tissue injections.Matter. 2022; 5: 975-987https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matt.2021.12.022Google Scholar To facilitate the cellular uptake of mRNA, they first screened a library of hybrid branched poly(β-amino esters) (PBAE) nanoparticles for the encapsulation and cellular delivery of mRNA. The top-performing mRNA-loaded PBAE nanoparticles were then lyophilized, concentrated, and filled into the robotic pill called Self-Orienting Millimeter-Scale Applicator (SOMA). Upon oral administration, the robotic pills quickly entered the stomach, where they could self-orient to allow the direct injection of mRNA nanoparticles into the stomach submucosa for robust mRNA expression, bypassing the natural barriers existing in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This study has led to a novel GI-tract-targeted oral delivery system for mRNA, holding great promise to promote the development of more convenient and patient-preferred oral mRNA therapeutics and vaccines. In addition to the oral delivery of mRNA, the SOMA robotic pills can also be used for the oral delivery of other macromolecules. The oral delivery strategy has the advantages of superior convenience and patient compliance.3Forbes D.C. Peppas N.A. Oral delivery of small RNA and DNA.J. Control.

B. 2018; 8: 147-164Google Scholar For example, Abramson et al. previously described the oral delivery of insulins using the SOMA robotic pills.6Abramson A. Caffarel-Salvador E. Khang M. Dellal D. Silverstein D. Gao Y. Frederiksen M.R. Vegge A. Hubálek F. Water J.J. et al.An ingestible self-orienting system for oral delivery of macromolecules.Science. 2019; 363: 611-615Google Scholar In this study, the authors demonstrated the novel and creative design of the ingestible self-orienting system-SOMA robotic pills, which were inspired by the leopard tortoise’s ability to passively reorient. Thus, orally administrated robotic pills could rapidly reach the stomach and enable self-orientation to the preferred upright position, allowing the injection of insulin-loaded tips into the mucosa within 1 min, which was triggered by the dissolution of caramelized sucrose. The insulin loads were then released to the mucosa within 1 h of the dissolution of the tips. To expand the applications of the SOMA robotic pill system, Traverso, Langer, and their groups have implemented the oral delivery of systemic monoclonal antibodies, peptides, and small molecules using a new version of the SOMA robotic pills.7Abramson A. Frederiksen M.R. Vegge A. Jensen B. Poulsen M. Mouridsen B. Jespersen M.O. Kirk R.K. Windum J. Hubálek F. et al.Oral delivery of systemic monoclonal antibodies, peptides and small molecules using gastric auto-injectors.Nat. Biotechnol. 2022; 40: 103-109Google Scholar The new robotic pills could not only enable the oral delivery of drugs whose size range from small molecules to monoclonal antibodies but also achieve a maximum drug plasma concentration that is similar to the standard-of-care subcutaneous injection within 30 min after the oral administration. Besides the SOMA robotic pill system, Traverso and associates have also developed many other smart biomedical devices for the oral delivery of biologic drugs.8Byrne J. Huang H.-W. McRae J.C. Babaee S. Soltani A. Becker S.L. Traverso G. Devices for drug delivery in the gastrointestinal tract: A review of systems physically interacting with the mucosa for enhanced delivery.Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2021; 177: 113926Google Scholar Instead of delivering the therapeutics to the stomach tissues, a new robotic pill system called luminal unfolding microneedle injector (LUMI), utilizing the tube-like geometry of the small intestine to provide plenty of points of contact with the tissues, was invented to deliver therapeutics to the intestinal tissues.9Abramson A. Caffarel-Salvador E. Soares V. Minahan D. Tian R.Y. Lu X. Dellal D. Gao Y. Kim S. Wainer J. et al.A luminal unfolding microneedle injector for oral delivery of macromolecules.Nat. Med. 2019; 25: 1512-1518Google Scholar Upon oral administration, the elegant design of this robotic pill allows the rapid propelling of dissolvable drug-loaded microneedles, located on three unfolding arms, into intestinal tissues. In another study, they designed a kirigami-inspired stent for the sustained delivery of therapeutics to the GI tract with maximal local drug efficacy and minimal potential systemic side effects.10Babaee S. Shi Y. Abbasalizadeh S. Tamang S. Hess K. Collins J.E. Ishida K. Lopes A. Williams M. Albaghdadi M. et al.Kirigami-inspired stents for sustained local delivery of therapeutics.Nat. Mater. 2021; 20: 1085-1092Google Scholar Therefore, a well-designed robotic pill system enables the oral delivery of mRNA to the GI tract, providing a simple and non-invasive approach for mRNA delivery, and might eventually benefit the rapid development of novel mRNA therapeutics and vaccines.

Oral mRNA delivery using capsule-mediated gastrointestinal tissue injectionsAbramson et al.MatterJanuary 31, 2022In BriefNucleic acid therapeutics and vaccines are only available as injectable formulations that generate discomfort and lead to low patient acceptance. To enable oral delivery, these therapeutics must avoid enzymatic degradation and bypass physical tissue barriers in the gastrointestinal tract. Here, the authors describe orally dosed pills capable of delivering nanoparticle formulations of nucleic acids with high transfection efficiencies via milli-needle injections into the gastric lining. This formulation-device combination results in gastric and systemic uptake in large and small animals, respectively. Full-Text PDF Open Archive

AB  - The Leopard Tortoise (Geochelone pardalis) is the largest of the southern African species and has a wide distribution encompassing a variety of habitats. There is a paucity of ecological information about Leopard Tortoises in these habitats. The goal of this study was to determine the population density, biomass, sex and age distributions, and morphometrics of Leopard Tortoises on farmland in the semi-arid Nama- Karoo. Because previous studies have found that body size distributions vary between mesic and xeric habitats, we expected that these Leopard Tortoises would show an increased body size compared to those from more mesic areas. In addition, we expected lower densities of Leopard Tortoises compared to more mesic areas. In total, 92 tortoises were caught with a male to female sex ratio of 1:1.3 that was not significantly

AB  - Five red-footed tortoises (Geochelone carbonaria) treated for intestinal nematode parasitism with a single IM injection of ivermectin (0.4 mg/kg) were found in a state of extreme paresis or flaccid paralysis. One tortoise recovered normal motor function over the next 7 to 10 days. The remaining tortoises died within 3 days of receiving the ivermectin. The only consistent postmortem finding was a marked fatty change in the liver. Studies in the red-footed tortoise showed that some paresis will occur with dosages as low as 0.05 mg/kg. At least 3 other species of chelonians were found to be susceptible to ivermectin toxicosis at similar dosages (0.1 mg/kg or less). The leopard tortoise (Geochelone pardalis) appeared to be the most susceptible of the species tested, consistently developing mild paresis with a dosage of 0.025 mg/kg. Death occurred with dosages as low as 0.3 mg/kg. A dosage of 0.05 mg/kg was found to be safe in red-footed tortoises, provided that treatment was not repeated at intervals of less than 7 days. Shedding of nematode larvae and eggs in the feces of parasitized red-footed tortoises was prevented with 2 to 6 weekly IM injections of ivermectin at a dosage of 0.05 mg/kg, but limited necropsy findings indicated that elimination of adult nematodes from the intestines was incomplete.

Onderstepoort Journal of Veterinary Research, 65:205-211 Ixodid ticks were collected during February of each year from 1983-1992 from bontebok and grey rhebok in the Bontebok National Park, Western Cape Province. When available other mammals as well as ground-nesting birds and leopard tortoises were examined. Eleven tick species were recov­ ered. Rhipicephalus nitens followed by Rhipicephalus glabroscutatum and an Ixodes sp. (near I. pilosus) were the most abundant, while Amblyomma marmoreum infested the widest host range. The larvae of three bot flies were also collected. Gedoelstia sp. and Strobiloestrus sp. larvae were recovered from bontebok and grey rhebok and larvae of Oestrus avis only from grey rhebok.

AB  - An approximately 20-year-old, female Leopard tortoise (Geochelone pardalis pardalis) was presented with dypsnea, wheezing, anorexia and depression. Whole body radiographs revealed generalized diffuse unstructured ‘interstitial lung pattern’ with thickened pulmonary septae while computed tomography (CT) showed emphysematous lung parenchyma and thickened pulmonary septae bordered by irregular ground-glass opacity with smaller areas of ‘honeycombing’. These imaging findings together with histopathologic findings were compatible with chronic, extensive ‘interstitial’ pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - DETERMINATION OF THE CONSTANT OF ABERRATION.—Comptes rendus for March 16 contains an abstract of a memoir by MM. Lœwy and Puiseux, on determinations of the aberration constant, in which some of the results obtained by M. Lœwy's method are given. Up to 1828, astronomers accepted, as the constant of aberration, values which were comprised between 20″˙255 and 20″˙708, these being respectively due to Delambre and Bessel. Richardson then obtained the value 20″˙446 from a discussion of 4000 observations made with the Greenwich mural circle by his predecessors. In 1843, W. Struve proposed a value almost identical with this, viz. 20″445, as the result of a discussion of his careful observations made in the prime vertical. He estimated the probable error as 0″˙011, and remarked that he did not think any astronomical element had been determined with so great an accuracy. Struve's work was received with much favour, and appeared to render unnecessary, for a number of years, all researches on the same subject. However, in 1844, Baily deduced 20″˙419 as the most probable value, and in after years, Peters, Lundhal, and Lindhagen subjected to a minute discussion all the meridian observations, made at Dorpat and Pulkova, of circumpolar stars. From their researches, a value a little greater than that of Struve was found. Still, when these results were taken in conjunction with the determinations the most worthy of confidence the values 20″˙45 and 20″˙46 were obtained, thus supporting Struve's work. Nyren, from a discussion of observations made by Struve in the prime vertical as material for the study of nutation, derived the value 20″˙43. In 1853, Struve himself proposed to increase his number to 20″˙463 with a probable error of 0″˙017, but the reasons given to justify the change do not appear to be sufficient. Gylden, Wagner, and Nyren's ulterior observations at Pulkova of circumpolar stars gave the higher value 20″˙49. Later, in 1879–82, Nyren made another determination by Struve's method, and used a large number of stars for the investigation. He then found 20″˙540 or 20″˙5l7, according to the method of grouping adopted. More recently, in 1885, Küstner, of Berlin Observatory, found 20″˙313 by Horrebow and Talcott's method. Between these two last numbers, both of which represent a large amount of work executed with much care, the difference is somewhat greater than 0″˙2—that is, about twenty times the probable error estimated by Struve in 1843. This seems to indicate that the astronomers have taken a step backwards. MM. Lœwy and Puiseux do not enumerate the work done on the same subject at Greenwich, the Cape, Washington, and other Observatories, but point out that similar sources of error exist in all the methods employed. Lœwy's method, as is now well known, consists in placing before the object-glass of an equatorial a double plane mirror formed by silvering the sides of a prism of glass. This acts as a sort of compass of strictly constant opening, and brings to the eyes rays which make a constant angle with each other. Pairs of stars separated by a wide angle on the celestial sphere, but which together appear in the field of view, can easily be found, and the variations in relative position due to refraction or aberration can be measured micrometrically with great precision. The adoption of this method leads the authors to the following tentative conclusions:—(1) The number 20″˙445, proposed by Struve, is very near to the truth. It would be premature, in our opinion, to wish to modify it.

AB  - THE BINARY STAR β DELPHINI.—In 1873 Burnham discovered that the primary star of the well-known wide doublestar 13 Deiphini wa itself a very close double, and a few years' observations sufficed to shox that it was a binary star in rapid motion. As the companion star has now described over 180° of its apparent path, a fairly accurate approximation to the elements of its orbit is possible. An attempt has accordingly been made, first by Dubiago and more recently by Gore, to determine the orbit, with tolerably accordant results. The former makes the period to be 26.07 years, with perihelion passage at 1882.19 and semi-axis major 0″.55. Gore finds the period to be 30.91 years, and fixes the periastron passage at 182.25, with semi-axis major = 0″.517. The observations are fairly well represented by these elements, considering what a close and difficult object the star is to measure. According to Gore's elements the components were at their minimum distance, 0″.192, at the epoch 1879.91; and during 1879 Burnham failed to elongate the star with the 181/2inch Dearborn refractor. We hope that those double-star observers who p ssess sufficiently powerful telescopes will not lose sight of this interesting object.

AB  - Abstract Although many reptiles, including tortoises, may be equipped morphologically to discriminate colors, there is very little experimental evidence that reptiles distinguish among hues and levels of saturation and brightness. Visual abilities or color (hue) discrimination have not been investigated for most tortoise species. In a behavioral experiment to test what visual cues are important, juvenile Leopard Tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis) approached the colors red, light green, and olive most often, raising important questions regarding plant color and selection by Leopard Tortoises.

Onderstepoort Journal of Veterinary Research, 64:1-4 Significant increases in serum globulins (a 1 , a 2 , ~andy) were observed in mountain leopard tortoises (Geochelone pardalis) after they had been immunized with nymphal homogenates of Amblyomma marmoreum. There was a concomitant significant increase in the numbers of leukocytes (lymphocytes, basophils, monocytes and eosinophils). Resistance to nymphal-challenge infestations was manifested by reduced feeding time, lower engorge­ ment masses, and significantly fewer (P < 0,0001) numbers of nymphs that moulted. These findings are contrary to the generally reported phenomenon, that ticks do not induce resistance in their natural hosts.

AB  - Radio-tracking studies of African tortoises have elucidated differences in spatial ecology in differing habitats. Our study aimed to demonstrate such patterns by radio tracking the Leopard Tortoise Stigmochelys pardalis in a subtropical savanna, northeast Swaziland. Activity of tracked tortoises was correlated with minimum temperatures and greater in the warm wet months compared with the cool, dry months. All tracked tortoises, however, remained active throughout the cool months, and none were observed entering a burrow or any other hibernaculum. The tortoises typically moved 0-89 m per day, with maximum daily movement of over 300 m. A dry river bed and game viewing road did not appear to obstruct the movement of the tortoises. The activity patterns of ectothermic animals often show strong seasonality (Adolph and Porter, 1993), especially where fluctuations in ambient temperature vary (Christian and Weavers, 1996). Thermal differences may translate into differ- ences in spatial ecology with consequences for the conservation and management of ectothermic populations. Home range and activity patterns are also expected to change with respect to seasonal fluctuations in climate (Ramsay et al., 2002).

AB  - Forschungsergebnisse mit Schildkroten haben gezeigt, dass sie in der Lage sind, sich anhand distaler Markierungen raumlich zu orientieren. Des Weiteren konnte gezeigt werden, dass sie eine kognitive Representation der Umgebung sowohl zum Navigieren als auch zur Unterscheidung verschiedener Farben und Formen verwenden konnen. In der vorliegenden Studie wurde untersucht, ob es fur sie auch moglich ist, lokale Markierungspunkte in ihrer Umgebung zu unterscheiden und sie zu nutzen, um an ein distales Ziel zu gelangen. Dieser Prozess verlangt vor allem die Fahigkeit, verschiedene Zeichen, so genannte "Cues", zu unterscheiden und sie mit einer bestimmten Richtung zu assoziieren. Dazu wurden Sporn - (Geochelone sulcata) und Pantherschildkroten (Stigmochelys pardalis) darauf trainiert, sich anhand zweier Zeichen, die sich in Farbe und Form unterschieden, in einem T-formigen Labyrinth zurechtzufinden. Die zwei Zeichen wurden mittig gegenuber der Startposition angebracht. Eines der Zeichen bedeutete eine Belohnung im rechten Arm des Versuchsaufbaus, das andere Zeichen bedeutete eine Belohnung auf der linken Seite. Die Ergebnisse zeigten, dass Spornschildkroten in der Lage waren, dies zu lernen. Danach wurden die Tiere darauf getestet, ob auch Geruche eine Rolle in der Orientierung spielten. Wie erwartet stellte sich heraus, dass dies nicht der Fall war. Im Anschluss daran wurde getestet, ob Farbe oder Form der „Cues“ wichtiger in dem Lernprozess waren. Die Leistung in diesem Test gab einen Hinweis darauf, dass Farbe, Form oder beides zusammen wichtig fur die Diskrimination sein konnten. Dies bedeutet, dass Schildkroten mit ihrer visuellen Wahrnehmung verschiedene Farben und Formen zu unterscheiden vermogen, und dass sie in der Lage sind, deren Funktionen mit Richtungen zu verbinden. Der Vergleich der beiden Arten, die ahnliche Lebensraume bewohnen, sich aber in ihrer Okologie unterscheiden, zeigte auf Grund der geringen Datenmenge keine signifikanten Ergebnisse.

AB  - A survey of local attitudes to tortoises and their conservation was conducted in Robanda and Mto wa Mbu in northern Tanzania between October 1994 and March 1995. Leopard tortoises damaged crops in Robanda village, Serengeti District. The Ikoma tribe of this district esteems the leopard tortoise as a totem animal, and the scutes have medicinal value. Trade was reported only in Mto wa Mbu, but most respondents were very reluctant to state the number of animals collected. Most respondents favoured conserving tortoises and biological diversity in their area. Given the close proximity to the road and Arusha, Mto wa Mbu residents placed more emphasis on cash values of the wildlife trade and tourism. In contrast, in Robanda, culture values may favour conservation. The low income per capita in Robanda, and the decline in culture norms among the young generation might change the people’s attitudes to tortoises. The paper recommends for raising public awareness among the youths in order to elicit community support for conservation.

AB  - The leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis) is the most widely distributed sub-Saharan tortoise species, with a range extending from the Horn of Africa all over eastern Africa to the Republic of South Africa, Namibia and southernmost Angola. Using 1938 bp of mitochondrial DNA (cyt b gene, partial ND4 gene plus adjacent tRNA genes) from a nearly range-wide sampling, we examined its phylogeographic structure and compared our findings with previously published GenBank sequences. We identified seven major clades that are largely parapatrically distributed. A few records of distinct haplotypes at the same locality or in close proximity could be the result of translocation of tortoises by man. The greatest diversity occurs in the south of the species’ range, with five out of the seven clades. Testing for isolation-by-distance suggests that the observed phylogeographic structure is the result of restricted geographical gene flow and not of historical vicariance. This is in sharp contrast to wide-ranging thermophilic reptiles from the western Palaearctic, whose phylogeographic structure was significantly shaped by Pleistocene range interruptions, but also by earlier dispersal and vicariant events. Most cyt b sequences of S. pardalis from GenBank turned out to be nuclear pseudogenes, or to be of chimerical origin from such pseudogenes and authentic mitochondrial sequences, which argues for caution regarding uncritical usage of GenBank sequences. The recent revalidation of the two subspecies of S. pardalis was based on such a chimerical sequence that was erroneously identified with the subspecies S. p. babcocki. Furthermore, according to our data, the distribution of mitochondrial clades does match neither the traditional subspecies ranges nor the pronounced geographical size variation of leopard tortoises. We conclude that there is no rationale for recognizing subspecies within S. pardalis.

Zusammenfassung

Die Pantherschildkrote (Stigmochelys pardalis) ist mit einem Areal, das sich vom Horn von Afrika uber Ostafrika bis nach Sudafrika, Namibia und ins sudliche Angola erstreckt, die am weitesten verbreitete subsaharische Landschildkrotenart. Anhand mitochondrialer DNA-Sequenzen (1938 bp; Cytochrom b-Gen, partielles ND4-Gen plus angrenzende tRNA-Gene) von Exemplaren aus fast dem gesamten Verbreitungsgebiet wurde die phylogeographische Struktur der Art untersucht. Die in dieser Arbeit gewonnenen Daten wurden zudem mit vorher veroffentlichten GenBank-Sequenzen verglichen. Sieben grosere Kladen wurden identifiziert, die fast komplett parapatrisch verbreitet sind; die wenigen Nachweise von unterschiedlichen Haplotypen am selben Fundort oder von unmittelbar benachbarten Fundorten konnten auf Schildkroten zuruckzufuhren sein, die vom Menschen verschleppt wurden. Im Suden des Verbreitungsgebietes, wo funf der sieben Kladen vorkommen, ist die Diversitat am grosten. Isolation-by-Distance-Tests deuten darauf hin, dass die phylogeographische Struktur der Pantherschildkrote auf eingeschrankten geographischen Genfluss und nicht auf historische Vikarianzereignisse zuruckzufuhren ist. Dies stellt einen klaren Unterschied zu weitverbreiteten warmeliebenden Reptilienarten aus der Westpalaarktis dar, deren phylogeographische Struktur ganz entscheidend durch pleistozane Arealzerschneidungen, aber auch durch altere Ausbreitungs- und Vikarianzereignisse beeinflusst wurde. Die meisten S. pardalis zugeschriebenen Cytochrom b-Sequenzen aus der GenBank stellten sich als Pseudogene oder chimarische Sequenzen aus authentischen mitochondrialen und Pseudogen-Fragmenten heraus. Dies unterstreicht, dass GenBank-Sequenzen nicht unkritisch verwendet werden durfen. Auch die kurzlich erfolgte Revalidierung der beiden Unterarten von S. pardalis ist auf eine chimarische Sequenz zuruckzufuhren, die irrtumlich der Unterart S. p. babcocki zugeschrieben worden war. Wie die Daten der vorliegenden Arbeit zeigen, deckt sich die Verbreitung der mitochondrialen Kladen weder mit den traditionell anerkannten Unterarten von S. pardalis, noch mit den betrachtlichen geographischen Grosenunterschieden bei der Pantherschildkrote, weswegen es keinen Grund gibt, bei dieser Spezies Unterarten anzuerkennen.

AB  - THE PLANET MERCURY.—An unusually good opportunity of observing the planet Mercury with the naked eye, or with an opera-glass, will be afforded about the middle of the present month. The planet will be at its greatest eastern elongation on May 16, when it will be 22° from the sun, and will remain above the horizon for two hours and a quarter after sunset. At this time the apparent diameter of the planet will be 8″, and about 0˙4 of the disc will be illuminated. On May 14, at 6 p.m., the planet will be in conjunction with the moon, Mercury being 2° 24′ to the south; at 9 p.m. on the same evening, the crescent of the two days' moon will be about 3° N.N.E. of the planet.

AB  - Nine acaricides (amitraz, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, cyfluthrin, fipronil, lindane, permethrin, phenothrin, and pyrethrins) were studied for their efficacy in killing the African tortoise tick (Amblyomma marmoreum). Only four of the acaricides (chlorpyrifos, cyfluthrin, lindane, and permethrin) produced 100% mortality within 24 hr of application, and only two (cyfluthrin and permethrin) continued to cause 100% mortality when diluted to as low as 1:10,000. Five of the acaricides (amitraz, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, cyfluthrin, and permethrin) were studied for toxicity to the leopard tortoise (Geochelone pardalis), the most common host of A. marmoreum. The results indicate that cyfluthrin and permethrin, which were herein found to be the two most effective acaricides for control of A. marmoreum, are also the safest acaricides for use on leopard tortoises.

AB  - Secondary nutritional metabolic bone disease was diagnosed in a gravid leopard tortoise (Geochelone pardalis pardalis). Diagnosis was based upon history, physical examination, hematology, plasma biochemistry, and radiography. Despite induced oviposition and treatment of metabolic bone disease for 8 wk, the tortoise's condition deteriorated. Repeat radiographs demonstrated gaseous intestinal distention. Oral administration of metoclopramide and mineral oil failed to stimulate defecation. Persistence of the ileus pattern prompted utilization of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT). MRI demonstrated brightly enhanced loops of mineral oil-filled small bowel and preovulatory follicles. CT demonstrated dystrophic calcification of the left hepatic lobe and preovu latory follicles and the typical reticular pattern of chelonian lung. The interstitial septa were caused by pulmonary vasculature or bands of smooth muscle.

AB  - The tortoise tick Amblyomma marmoreum Koch was found to be established on a reptile facility in central Florida. Over a 5-mo period, 443 ticks were collected from tortoises, dogs, and vegetation. Collections from hosts were primarily from 3 species of exotic tortoises, including leopard tortoises, Aldabra tortoises, and yellow-footed tortoises. The total numbers of ticks present, the presence of all life stages, and the slow development of this species indicate that this is not a recent infestation. The source of the infestation is unknown because no tortoises were imported or moved onto this premise within the previous year. The propensity of this tick to feed on mammals and reptiles as immatures, its status as an experimental heartwater vector, and potential for further accidental introductions to the United States elicit concern toward the more widespread establishment of this species.

AB  - Objective: Tortoise picornavirus (ToPV) has been speculated to play an important role in the frequently seen disease pattern of juvenile shell softening. This study aimed to determine ToPV prevalence among German tortoise collections. Material and methods: A total of 334 animals selected from 27 different collections were included. Seven species of four genera of the family Testudinidae (Testudo graeca, T. hermanni, T. marginata, T. horsfieldii, Centrochelys sulcata, Stigmochelys pardalis, Chelonoidis carbonarius) were sampled. The tortoises were clinically investigated and none of the adults showed any signs of shell softening. Seven hatchlings of a ToPV-positive T. graeca breeding pair showed retarded growth and a progressive shell weakness that resulted in death. Each animal was sampled by conjunctival, pharyngeal and cloacal swabs (990 swabs in total) and blood sampling (293 in total). All three swabs of one animal were pooled and tested by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for tortoise picornavirus RNA. Blood samples were investigated by virus neutralisation test (VNT) for specific anti ToPV antibodies. All titres equal to or higher than log2 = 2 were considered positive. Results: In total, 35 adult and 11 juvenile animals were tested positive for ToPV RNA. The serological investigation did detect specific antibodies against ToPV in 44 adult tortoises and one juvenile. In total, 76 animals were tested positive in either one of the investigations, 16 animals in both. The highest number of ToPV-positive animals was found for T. graeca, with a prevalence of 32 %. No specimens of C. carbonarius, C. sulcata, or S. pardalis were tested positive. Conclusion and clinical relevance: The results propose a predisposition in T. graeca, as well as a high prevalence of ToPV in T. graeca, whereas other species showed only single or no positive animals, but may function as virus carriers.

AB  - The release of tortoises after confinement and treatment in rehabilitation centres includes the risk that released individuals may infect wild conspecifics with foreign parasites and other pathogens. The recent monitoring of the release of rehabilitated leopard tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis) onto private land in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa, revealed that the health-checking protocol at the wildlife rehabilitation centre was inadequate. As a result the provincial conservation authority placed a moratorium on further leopard tortoise releases until a comprehensive health-checking protocol was in place. This protocol is detailed here to ensure the success of the release of confiscated and rehabilitated leopard tortoises, and that this does not come at cost to the wild leopard tortoise populations.

AB  - IN a discussion which took place in NATURE some time ago on the so-called “Barisâl Guns” and other mysterious sounds, Prof. Hughes suggested that it would be desirable to ascertain how far the firing of guns can be heard (vol. liii. p. 31). In connection with another subject, that of spurious earthquakes (see NATURE, vol. lx. pp. 139–141), I have for some time been collecting notes on this point, and I propose here to describe some of the facts obtained, chiefly with regard to the great naval review at Spithead on June 26, 1897, and the operations of the French fleet at Cherbourg on July 18, 1900.

AB  - The population parameters (morphometrics, population size and biomass) were determined for leopard and angulate tortoises in the Thicket Biome, Eastern Cape, South Africa. Leopard tortoises had a mean total length of 306.47mm (SD = 94.65mm, range 59–496mm,n = 89). Males were smaller (mean total length 277.31mm, SD = 71.85mm, range 73–377mm,n = 36) than females (mean total length = 332.33mm, SD = 97.64mm, range 59–496mm, n = 53). Angulate tortoises had a mean total length of 155.17mm (SD = 33.89mm, range 59–194mm, n = 18). Males were larger (mean total length = 186mm, SD = 8.40mm, range 174–194mm, n = 5) than females (mean total length = 143.31mm, SD = 32.48mm, range 59–178mm, n = 13). The estimated population density for leopard tortoises was 0.85 tortoises ha−1 with an estimated biomass of 6.02kg −1. Angulate tortoise population density was estimated at 0.12 tortoises ha−1 with a mean biomass of 0.06kg ha−1. The possible consequences of this high density and biomass are discussed.

AB  - Assessment of the efficacy of leopard tortoise farming was made in Dar es Salaam and Arusha between June and July 1995. Three out of four farms held parental stocks in excess of the legal quota. Some farms also held stocks of mixed provenance, unsuitable for farming. None of the farms had suitable enclosures. Drinking and bathing water was not changed frequently resulting dirt contamination. Few grasses and no mineral supplements were included in the tortoise diet. No regular veterinary inspection was made for parasite removal. The farms underreported tortoise deaths. The reproductive output of the captive tortoise was generally poor. Furthermore, farm owners lacked the expertise and commitment required for breeding tortoises in captivity. Farming cannot sustain the leopard tortoise export trade under the present breeding regime. The study concludes with recommendations for improving tortoise farming in Tanzania.

AB  - A total of 586 reptiles, belonging to 35 species and five subspecies, were examined in surveys aimed at determining the species spectrum and geographic distribution of ticks that infest them. Of these reptiles 509 were tortoises, 28 monitor or other lizards, and 49 snakes. Nine ixodid tick species, of which seven belonged to the genus Amblyomma , and one argasid tick, Ornithodoros compactus were recovered. Seven of the ten tick species are parasites of reptiles. Amongst these seven species Amblyomma marmoreum was most prevalent and numerous on leopard tortoises, Geochelone pardalis ; Amblyomma nuttalli was present only on Bell's hinged tortoises, Kinixys belliana ; and most Amblyomma sylvaticum were collected from angulate tortoises, Chersina angulata. Amblyomma exornatum (formerly Aponomma exornatum ) was only recovered from monitor lizards, Varanus spp. ; most Amblyomma latum (formerly Aponomma latum ) were from snakes; and a single nymph of Amblyomma transversale (formerly Aponomma transversale ) was collected from a southern African python, Python natalensis . All 30 Namaqualand speckled padloper tortoises, Homopus signatus signatus , examined were infested with O. compactus . The seasonal occurrence of A. sylvaticum and the geographic distribution of this tick and of A. marmoreum, A. nuttalli, A. exornatum, A. latum and O. compactus are illustrated.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Although tortoises (Testudinidae) are a familiar clade of reptiles, with a body fossil record extending to at least the Eocene, hitherto no tortoise ichnosites have been described. Here, a number of sites attributed to tortoise trackmakers are identified within Pleistocene aeolianites on South Africa's Cape south coast. These date from late Marine Isotope Stage 6 to Marine Isotope Stage 4. The findings indicate large trackmakers, with evidence of a trackmaker length of more than a meter—substantially longer than the largest extant tortoises in southern Africa. This suggests either the presence of an extinct very large tortoise species, or that Pleistocene leopard tortoises in the region were larger than their descendants. Variations in substrate properties are responsible for a variety of track and trace forms. A mismatch exists between the reported ichnological evidence for large tortoises, and the regional archaeological and body fossil records, which almost exclusively comprise smaller tortoises. The findings illustrate the potential of ichnology to complement and augment the paleontological and archaeological records.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Reptile behaviour and welfare are understudied in comparison with mammals. In this study, behavioural data on three species of tortoises were recorded before and after an environmental change which was anticipated to be positive in nature. The environmental changes differed for each population, but included a substantial increase in enclosure size, the addition of substrate material, and a change in handling procedure. A tortoise-specific ethogram was created to standardise data collection. Focal behaviour sampling was used to collect behavioural data. Changes in the duration of performance of co-occupant interaction and object interaction in the leopard (Stigmochelys pardalis) and Aldabra (Aldabrachelys gigantea) tortoises were observed following the environmental changes. The Shannon-Weiner&amp;rsquo;s diversity index did not yield a significant increase after the changes but had a numerical increase which was relatively greater for the leopard tortoise group, which had experienced the greatest environmental change. The leopard tortoises also demonstrated changes in a greater number of behaviours compared to the other species, and this was sustained over the study period. However, this included a behaviour indicative of negative affect; aggression. Whilst we are unable to conclude that welfare was improved by the management changes, there are suggestions that behavioural diversity increased, and some promotion of positive social behaviours occurred.</jats:p>

AB  - Four species of fossil turtles are reported from Pleistocene deposits of Olduvai Gorge. Two are testudinids; one is identical to the extant Geochelone pardalis, and the other is a large undescribed species. The two remaining turtle species are pelomedusids. One is identical to the extant Pelusios sinuatus; the other is described as a new genus and species (Latisternon microsulcae) and, on the basis of shell morphology, is presumed to have been more terrestrial than extant pelomedusid species. Most of the fossil chelonian remains are believed to have been accumulated by foraging hominids. The Pelusios sinuatus fossils greatly outnumber those of the other three species; apparently it was the most assiduously hunted. The distribution of fossils and the ecology of the living Pelusios suggest that most foraging for turtles took place in the shallow water of the marshy lake border.

AB  - THE SPECTRUM OF THE CHROMOSPHERE.—At the recent meeting of the Astronomical and Astrophysical Society of America, held at Washington, Mr. S. A. Mitchell read a paper on the observations made during the total solar eclipse in Sumatra on May 18, 1901. The spectrum photographs were obtained with an objective grating spectrograph; the grating had a ruled surface 31/2× 5 inches, with 15,000 lines to the inch, the objective being a quartz lens of a little more than 31/4 inches aperture and about 72 inches focal length. Light from the eclipsed sun was reflected into this instrument by a coelostat. The adjustments were such as to ensure a “normal” spectrum, this being the case when grating and photographic plate were each perpendicular to the diffracted beam. The first order was employed, from λ 3000 to λ 6000. Although the sky was never clear during the period of totality of 5 min. 41 secs., eight exposures were made—one before and one just after totality for the cusp spectra, one at first and one at second flash, and four with varying exposures during the total phase. The second flash appeared fully exposed, and the plate has been carefully measured. The dispersion is such that from Hβ to Hɛ occupies a length of 95.4 mm., i.e. 1 tenth-metre correspjnds to about 0.1 mm. In the region mentioned, Hβ to Hɛ, 363 lines have been determined. Of these, 269 have been identified with lines on Rowland's map.

Trouvelot has previously recorded a remarkable luminous outburst that occurred on the sun on June 17. The position-angle of the group of prominences observed by M. Fényi was about 282°. At one time the velocity of one portion of the group reached the high value of about 850 kilometres per second. And another portion was elevated through about 72′ 2″in 210 seconds—the mean velocity being at least 485 kilometres per second.

AB  - Six adult (three female and three male) leopard tortoises (Testudo pardalis) were stud ied to document the radiographie anatomy of the gastrointestinal tract and the transit time of barium sulfate. Tortoises were chemically immobilized with succinylcholine and dosed orally with barium contrast suspension. Both dorsoventral and lateral radiographs were taken. The lateral radiographs were extremely difficult to interpret because of the overlapping of the gastrointestinal tract and other soft tissue organs. Complete gastric emptying occurred between 5 and 9 hr after barium administration. Barium entered the small intestine at 0.2-1 hr and the large intestine between 5 and 8 hr. The contrast material began to exit the colon between 144 and 166 hr.

AB  - Like birds, the most common dental problem seen in amphibians is oral trauma. Turtles can present with “beak” fracture. The repair of fractured turtle shells with dental materials is a common procedure. Leopard tortoise is found in the savannahs of eastern and southern Africa and Sudan to the Southern Cape. Galapagos tortoise is the largest living species of tortoise and found in Galapagos islands of the south Pacific about 400 miles west of Ecuador and Aldabra in the Indian Ocean. Green sea turtle is found in the tropical and subtropical seas throughout the world. Designed as a practical resource for treating exotic animals, this chapter is filled with instructive photographs and illustrations of these amphibians. Written for zoo and wildlife caretakers and veterinarians, veterinary dentists, veterinary technicians, and veterinary students, it is a practical resource that has information for the dental care of a wide range of animal species that are all too often neglected.

AB  - <jats:p>Reptile behaviour and welfare are understudied in comparison with mammals. In this study, behavioural data on three species (Astrochelys radiata, Stigmochelys pardalis, Aldabrachelys gigantea) of tortoises were recorded before and after an environmental change which was anticipated to be positive in nature. The environmental changes differed for each population, but included a substantial increase in enclosure size, the addition of substrate material, and a change in handling procedure. A tortoise-specific ethogram was created to standardise data collection. Focal behaviour sampling was used to collect behavioural data. Changes in the duration of performance of co-occupant interaction and object interaction in the leopard (Stigmochelys pardalis) and Aldabra (Aldabrachelys gigantea) tortoises were observed following the environmental changes. The Shannon–Weiner diversity index did not yield a significant increase after the changes but had a numerical increase which was relatively greater for the leopard tortoise group, which had experienced the greatest environmental change. The leopard tortoises also demonstrated changes in a greater number of behaviours compared to the other species, and this was sustained over the study period. However, this included a behaviour indicative of negative affect: aggression. Whilst we are unable to conclude that welfare was improved by the management changes, there are suggestions that behavioural diversity increased, and some promotion of positive social behaviours occurred.</jats:p>

AB  - To date, four intraerythrocytic apicomplexans, namely the haemogregarines Haemogregarina fitzsimonsi and Haemogregarina parvula, and the haemoproteids Haemoproteus testudinalis and Haemoproteus natalensis, have been described from South African land tortoises. Recently, an intraleucocytic haemogregarine was observed in one species of tortoise, Stigmochelys pardalis, from the province of KwaZulu-Natal. Gamonts were identified in the monocytes and lymphocytes of 5/126 (4%) S. pardalis, but no additional stages were detected. Mixed infections with H. fitzsimonsi were observed for 2/5 (40%) of the parasitized S. pardalis, but the intraleucocytic gamont stages were larger than the intraerythrocytic gamont stages of both H. fitzsimonsi and H. parvula. The only other record of a chelonian intraleucocytic haemogregarine is of Haemogregarina pseudemydis, with stages described from the red and white blood cells of neotropical terrapins. Thus, the report of an intraleucocytic haemogregarine infecting a terrestrial tortoise from Africa is significant, although its taxonomic placement remains problematic at present.

AB  - THE measurement of the wave-lengths of the dark lines of the solar spectrum obtained by photographs, and the construction of a chart of the same, has for many years occupied my leisure time. As a result of the investigations connected with this work, I have arrived at the belief that oxygen as well as other non-metallic gaseous elements are represented in the solar spectrum by dark lines in the same manner as metallic substances. The lines in the case of oxygen are, however, very faint when compared with those produced by metals in the vaporous state.

AB  - SPECTRUM OF NOVA PERSEI.—In the current issue of Comptes rendus (vol. cxxxii. pp. 1542–1544) M. Deslandres gives a third series of observations of the spectrum of Nova Persei as obtained at the Meudon Observatory. Since the previous communication, spectrographs of varying power have been installed for use with the two telescopes of 0.84 metre and 0.60 metre aperture, and both photographic and visual records of the spectrum obtained during the periods of minima, although unfavourable weather has considerably interfered with their continuity. In this later work special attention has been devoted to the expected detection of the principal nebular lines. M. Deslandres states that during the first stages the principal green lines present were distinctly not the nebular lines, but the lines of parhelium, λ492 and λ5015, this being well shown in a photograph taken on March 3. On a plate taken on April 17, however, the measured position of the chief green line was λ5008, but on account of breadth of line the value is of course only approximate. The star was near its minimum brightness on this date. The gradual varying intensity of this line relative to the Hβ line of hydrogen is then described, the details being in close agreement with those already published by other observers.

AB  - THE DOUBLE-STAR α HERCULIS.—Smyth, in his “Cycle of Celestial Objects,” attributes to Sir William Herschel the discovery of the duplicity of this star; but the companion was detected two years earlier than Sir William's first observation, and under somewhat curious circumstances. It was perceived by Maskelyne while observing the meridian passage on August 7, 1777, and only seven days later Christian Mayer, also observing the transit of the star with his mural quadrant, noted it to be double. The particulars are detailed in Mayer's work, “De Novis in Cœlo Sidereo Phenomenis,” published at Mannheim in 1779. He had communicated to Maskelyne a number of his results bearing upon the double-stars; and the Greenwich astronomer, in replying towards the end of 1777, relates that he had observed a similar phenomenon in α Herculis on the date given above, “et videns valde obstupui,” he remarks, since he had so often observed the star on the meridian without perceiving the companion. Maskelyne considered it of the sixth magnitude, the principal star being estimated a third; the latter he judged to be reddish, and the companion pale; Mayer, who discovered the smaller star on August 14, called it a seventh or eighth magnitude.

AB  - Herpesviruses are found in free-living and captive chelonian populations, often in association with morbidity and mortality. To date, all known chelonian herpesviruses fall within the subfamily <i>Alphaherpesvirinae</i>. We detected a novel herpesvirus in 3 species of chelonians: a captive leopard tortoise (<i>Stigmochelys pardalis</i>) in western TX, USA; a steppe tortoise (<i>Testudo</i> [<i>Agrionemys</i>] <i>horsfieldii</i>) found near Fort Irwin, CA, USA; and 2 free-living, three-toed box turtles (<i>Terrapene mexicana triunguis</i>) found in Forest Park, St. Louis, MO. The leopard tortoise was coinfected with the tortoise intranuclear coccidian and had clinical signs of upper respiratory tract disease. The steppe tortoise had mucopurulent nasal discharge and lethargy. One of the three-toed box turtles had no clinical signs; the other was found dead with signs of trauma after being observed with blepharedema, tympanic membrane swelling, cervical edema, and other clinical signs several weeks prior to death. Generally, the branching order of the turtle herpesviruses mirrors the divergence patterns of their hosts, consistent with codivergence. Based on phylogenetic analysis, this novel herpesvirus clusters with a clade of viruses that infect emydid hosts and is likely of box turtle origin. Therefore, we suggest the name terrapene alphaherpesvirus 3 (TerAHV3) for the novel virus. This virus also has the ability to host-jump to tortoises, and previously documented herpesviral morbidity tends to be more common in aberrant hosts. The relationship between clinical signs and infection with TerAHV3 in these animals is unclear, and further investigation is merited.
