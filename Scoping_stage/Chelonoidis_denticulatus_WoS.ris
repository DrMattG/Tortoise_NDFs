AB  - One herein reports a successful case of celiotomy by plastrotomy for removal of foreign bodies in yellow-footed tortoise (Geochelone denticulata). The animal was treated at the Veterinary Hospital of the Federal University of Piaui, with appetite loss, regurgitation, constipation, lethargy, reluctance to walk and slightly reddish ocular mucous membranes. Radiographic examination was performed, confirming the presence of foreign bodies in the stomach. The tortoise underwent celiotomy by plastrotomy for the removal of the foreign bodies. The opening of the plastron was performed through the abdominal shields, with the aid of a circular mini grinding saw. One performed an incision in the midline between the two abdominal veins to access the abdominal cavity. A gastrotomy for removal of the foreign bodies (nails, toothpicks, stones, pieces of plastic, glass and crockery pieces) was performed after the location of the stomach. The surgery was successful and confirmed with radiographic evaluation in the immediate postoperative period. The celiotomy by plastrotomy for removal of foreign bodies in that animal proved to be a viable, very important and safe technique to the survival of chelonians.

AB  - The lack of cost-effective methods to detect game species in tropical forests hinders reliable assessments of their population status and the planning of effective actions for their sustainable use. Tortoises are among the most hunted species in Amazonia, but present low detectability in the wild when using current scientific methods. Traditional hunters in the region use specialized methods to capture tortoises, and such knowledge could provide useful insights for improving monitoring methods and, thus, scientific research on this species. Here, we compare the capture rates and cost-effectiveness of two methods to capture the endangered yellow-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis denticulatus) in Amazonia: the conventional active search and an adaptation of pitfall traps using attractive baits employed by Indigenous and non-Indigenous people to hunt tortoises. We sampled 40 sites in upland forests and whitewater flooded forests during the dry and wet seasons in central Amazonia and captured 37 yellow-footed tortoises. The highest capture rate (0.29 tortoises/hour) was obtained using traps in upland forests, fourfold higher than by active search. Traps also presented greater cost-effectiveness than the active search (US$63 vs US$256 per captured tortoise). Our capture rate with traps was 67 times greater than those obtained using line transects in western and northern Amazonia. The success exhibited by this widespread hunting technique is a result of centuries of hunters' traditional knowledge in the Amazon. The unveiling of a cost-effective method for capturing tortoises shows the importance of exchanging traditional and scientific knowledge; efficient capturing methods favor the inclusion of the species in long-term monitoring programs and foster in situ studies that help develop strategies for its conservation.

AB  - Eimeria motelo sp. n. is described from faeces of the yellow-footed tortoise, Geochelone denticulata (L.). Oocysts are irregularly ellipsoidal or cylindrical, with slightly expressed lobed protrusions and irregularities at the poles, possibly, caused by wrinkling of the oocyst wall, 17 (15-19) x 9.4 (8.5-11) mum, shape index (length/width) being 1.81 (1.45-2). The oocyst wall is smooth, single-layered, 0.5 mum thick with no micropyle. There are no polar bodies. Sporocysts are ellipsoidal, 8.9 (7.5-10) x 4.4 (4-5) mum. shape index 2.03 (1.7-2.5). A sporocyst residuum is present, composed of many granules of irregular size. The sporozoites are elongate, lying lengthwise in the sporocysts. Comparison with other species of the genus Eimeria parasitising members of family Testudinidae indicates that the presently described coccidium represents a new species. The name of Eimeria carinii Lainson, Costa & Shaw, 1990 is found to be preoccupied by a homonym, Eimeria carinii Pinto 1928 given to a coccidium from Rattus norvegicus. Therefore, it is replaced by Eimeria lainsoni nom. nov.

AB  - Captive terrestrial tortoises of the species Chelonoidis carbonaria (n=17) and Chelonoidis denticulata (n=37) in the state of Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil, were examined for hematozoans by using a combination of microscopic and molecular methods. Microscopic examination revealed young intra-erythrocytic forms in blood smears from both species of tortoises. The results of PCR, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis indicated that these parasites belonged to the Haemoproteus spp., whose observed prevalence was 17.6 % in C. carbonaria and 13.5 % in C. denticulata. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that these sequences formed a clade that was grouped with other sequences of Haemoproteus spp. parasites in birds, separate from the clade formed by Haemoproteus spp. of reptiles. This study expands the information regarding the occurrence and distribution of hemosporidia in turtles and is the first study of blood parasites in C. carbonaria.

AB  - The present study reports on patterns of parasitism by Amblyomma humerale on yellow-footed tortoise, Chelonoidis denticulatus, in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil. The tortoises were sampled occasionally, from July 2005 to January 2020. We collected 81 adult ticks from seven tortoises (mean = 11.57 +/- 6.90 ticks/host), of which 72 were males (88.9%) and nine females (11.1%), resulting in an 8:1 sex ratio (males:females). Males were found in clusters, attached to the carapace. Females occurred mainly isolated, attached to coriaceous integumental areas (n = 7; 77.8%), especially the engorged females (100%). We suggest that the difference between attachment sites is a strategy used by fertilized females to avoid mechanical removal from their host through friction with elements of the environment. Because they undergo a considerable increase of volume when engorged, they move to more sheltered places on their host's surface. The parasitism patterns by A. humerale on C. denticulatus were compatible with those observed in the Amazon region and in the Cerrado-Amazonia transition. The present work provides information about the life history and host-parasite interface of the two species and contributes to understanding the parasitism patterns by A. humerale on C. denticulatus in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify and describe intestinal lesions caused by helminths in red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonarius) and yellow-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis denticulatus) reared in captivity in the Zoo and Botanical Park of Teresina, Piaui State, Brazil. The parasitological evaluation of 142 of these tortoises revealed that all were parasitized by helminths (ascarids and strongyles), which were identified by light and electron microscopy as Atractis thapari and Chapiniella variabilis. The 12 most parasitized tortoises (six per species) were euthanized, and samples of small and large intestine were evaluated by histopathology. Macroscopically, all small and large intestines had hyperaemia. Microscopically, hyperaemia (12/12), diffuse goblet cell hyperplasia (8/12) and submucosa oedema (1/12) were observed in the small intestine. Hyperaemia was observed in the large intestine, varying from discrete to intense (12/12) and focally extensive and severe transmural granulomatous enteritis (1/12).

AB  - The extinction of frugivores has been considered one of the main drivers of the disruption of important ecological processes, such as seed dispersal. Many defaunated forests are too small to restore function by reintroducing large frugivores, such as tapirs or Ateline monkeys, and the long-term fate of large-seeded plants in these areas is uncertain. However, such small fragments still host many species and play relevant ecosystem services. Here, we explore the use of two tortoise species, the red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonarius) and the yellow-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis denticulatus), as ecological substitutes for locally extinct large seed dispersers in small forest patches in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We employed prior knowledge on the known occurrences of Chelonoidis species and used ecological niche modeling (ENM) to identify forest patches for tortoise rewilding. Based on habitat suitability, food availability and conservation co-benefits, we further refined our analysis and identified that the more suitable areas for tortoise reintroduction are forest patches of northern Atlantic Forest, areas with high defaunation intensity. Giant tortoises have been used to restore lost ecological services in island ecosystems. We argue that reintroducing relatively smaller tortoises is an easy-to-use/control conservation measure that could be employed to partially substitute the seed dispersal services of extinct large disperser species, mitigating the negative cascading effects of defaunation on reducing plant diversity.

AB  - Intranuclear coccidiosis of tortoises (TINC) has been described in association with systemic disease in various species of tortoises. TINC has been detected in numerous tortoises from the United States, but there are only a few reports from tropical tortoises in Germany and no reports from Asia. Using a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, samples from 1,011 tortoises were screened for the presence of TINC. Samples originated from animals kept in captivity in Europe and in China. Coccidia were detected in a total of 27 chelonians (2.7%), including the first description of TINC in a marginated tortoise (Testudo marginata), Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni), African spurred tortoise (Centrochelys sulcata), and yellow-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis denticulatus). The highest percentage of positive animals was found in radiated tortoises (Astrochelys radiata). Although the percentage of positive animals was relatively low, this study demonstrates the global distribution of TINC in captive chelonians as well as expanding the known host range for these pathogens.

AB  - Habitat selection and extension of the area used by a given species may vary during different phases of its life and are often determined by the distribution and availability of resources throughout the landscape, such as food, breeding sites, and shelters. In this study, we assessed the influence of body size on the areas used by 21 individuals of the yellow-footed tortoises (Chelonoidis denticulatus) from January to June 2017 in a dense rain forest area in Central Amazonia. We also investigated whether individuals selected different ranges of terrain slope, elevation, areas with high food availability, or areas with treefall gaps that could be used for shelter or thermoregulation. We monitored tortoise movements using thread-bobbins, and sampled terrain characteristics, availability of potential food resources and forest gaps along the routes used by the tortoises. We also measured the same variables in plots distributed systematically throughout the study area to evaluate resource availability. Tortoises used an average area of 1.56 ha (SD = 1.51, min = 0.03, max = 6.44). The size of the area used was positively associated with the individual body size, but did not vary between sexes. Small individuals selected higher and flatter areas where the availability of fallen flowers was higher, whereas the area used by larger individuals did not differ from the natural availability of topographic traits and food in the region. Although tortoises did not select areas according to availability of tree-fall gaps, most larger tortoises were found sheltered under fallen trees (85%). Conversely, small individuals were mainly found hidden under litter (66%). Body size determined the patterns of landscape use by tortoises; larger individuals were mainly generalists, but small individuals occupied high and flat areas. The yellow-footed tortoise is endangered by hunting, illegal collection for the pet trade, habitat destruction and effects of climate change. Size-related differences in habitat selection should be taken into account in species-distribution models for the identification of suitable areas for reintroduction and the development of management plans in protected areas.

AB  - Hunting is intensely practiced in the Amazon and is related to the survival of riverside communities as a source of income and food. This study was conducted at Resex Cazumba-Iracema between June and November, in the dry season and the beginning of the flood period. Twenty-one families were monitored. six hunting events were followed, and 23 C denticulatus individuals were recorded, all of which were categorized as opportunistic. Among the studied individuals, 11 were males and 12 females, and those with a carapace over 40 cm were considered adults. The tortoise is captured mainly for food, but there are beliefs concerning its medicinal use in treating inflammatory diseases. Reptiles, in general, are among the least hunted species for food in the Amazon. This preference may be related to the higher mammals' biomass and the birds' species richness. However, its importance for consumption may vary according to the location.

AB  - According to most studies on seed dispersal in tropical forests, mammals and birds are considered the main dispersal agents and the role played by other animal groups remains poorly explored. We investigate qualitative and quantitative components of the role played by the tortoise Chelonoidis denticulata in seed dispersal in southeastern Amazon, and the influence of seasonal variation in tortoise movement patterns on resulting seed shadows. Seed shadows produced by this tortoise were estimated by combining information on seed passage times through their digestive tract, which varied from 3 to 17 days, with a robust dataset on movements obtained from 18 adult C. denticulata monitored with radio transmitters and spoon-and-line tracking devices. A total of 4,206 seeds were found in 94 collected feces, belonging to 50 seed morphotypes of, at least, 25 plant genera. Very low rates of damage to the external structure of the ingested seeds were observed. Additionally, results of germination trials suggested that passage of seeds through C. denticulata's digestive tract does not seem to negatively affect seed germination. The estimated seed shadows are likely to contribute significantly to the dispersal of seeds away from parent plants. During the dry season seeds were dispersed, on average, 174.1 m away from the location of fruit ingestion; during the rainy season, this mean dispersal distance increased to 276.7 m. Our results suggest that C. denticulata plays an important role in seed dispersal in Amazonian forests and highlight the influence of seasonal changes in movements on the resulting seed shadows.

AB  - Environmental enrichment is a principle that is used to enhance the quality of care for nonhuman animals in captivity. To achieve this, it is necessary to understand the animal's needs. This study focused on color preference to provide food stimuli as a source of environmental enrichment for the tortoise, Chelonoidis denticulata. During this study, the stimuli green-, blue-, yellow-, and red-colored bananas and plaster blocks were randomly offered to the tortoises. Analysis of the data showed that the tortoises had a preference for the stimuli dyed with colors red and yellow over the other presented colors. It was possible to conclude that presenting food in different colors stimulated the animals to evaluate their environment and make choices in relation to their color preference. Thus, this experiment introduced an element of choice into their lives, beyond identifying color food preferences for the tortoises. The element of choice is known to be important to animal welfare.

AB  - An annotated checklist of the helminth parasites associated with reptiles from Peru is provided, as the result of a compilation of parasitological papers published between 1963 and January 2022 and records of species deposited in national and international collections. The list provides data on hosts, developmental stage, sites of infection, geographical distribution in Peruvian territory, code of material deposited in helminthological collections, references and taxonomic notes. The database includes records of 106 different species of helminth parasites (82 nominal species and 24 taxa identified at the generic level), the majority in the adult stage. These helminth parasites come from 18 of the 25 official Peruvian regions. Nematodes have the highest richness in number of species (79 species), followed by trematodes (17 species) and cestodes (nine species). The acanthocephalans are represented by only one species. The parasites with the highest number of records were Physaloptera retusa Rudolphi, 1819 (11 hosts), Physalopteroides venancioi (Lent, Freitas & Proenca, 1946) (nine hosts), Strongyluris oscari Travassos, 1923 (seven hosts), and Parapharyngodon scleratus Travassos, 1923 (five hosts), all of which are nematodes. The 106 taxa of helminth parasites have been reported infecting 55 species of reptiles in Peru, distributed in 34 genera and 14 families. The reptile species harbouring the highest number of helminth parasites are the yellow-footed tortoise Chelonoidis denticulatus (Linnaeus) with 18 species (three trematodes and 15 nematodes), followed by the Peru desert tegu Dicrodon guttulatum Dumeril & Bibron (Teiidae) with 11 species (three cestodes and eight nematodes) and the yellow-spotted Amazon River turtle Podocnemis unifilis Troschel (Podocnemididae) with 10 species (five trematodes and five nematodes). Of the 524 species of reptiles reported in Peru, only 55 (>10%) are reported as hosts of helminths representing a small proportion considering the great variety of reptile hosts that inhabit the various tropical and subtropical geographical areas of Peru.

AB  - Chelonians constitute an important source of food and income for the inhabitants of tropical forests. We assessed the social, biological, and environmental factors affecting the hunting and trade of the endangered yellow-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis denticulata) in rural and urban areas in the Amazon and estimated the sustainability of tortoise use. We also discuss possible conservation alternatives that are compatible with the needs of local inhabitants. We monitored tortoise hunting and trade for 12 years in 10 traditional communities that exploit different habitat types in the Brazilian Amazon and collected data on the tortoise trade in two urban markets for six years. In upland forests, tortoise hunting mainly occurred during the dry season; in whitewater flooded forests, hunting mainly occurred during the flood season. The tortoise trade was carried out nearly entirely by whitewater flooded forest users and was intimately related to fishing, the main economic activity in these communities. Furthermore, the tortoise trade was encouraged in whitewater flooded forests because this environment yielded significantly heavier tortoises than upland forests, and we observed a strong relationship between trade probability and tortoise size. The tortoise trade was found to primarily supply nearby urban centers, generating high monetary gain. Female tortoises suffered greater hunting pressure and were more valued in the bushmeat market. The productivity of tortoise hunting in the monitored communities severely decreased with time. In addition, the price per kilogram of tortoise greatly increased in the urban market. Given this unsustainable scenario, policies regulating tortoise hunting in the Amazon are needed. These policies must be adapted to the different patterns of tortoise use by rural communities while maintaining the culture and food sovereignty of the local inhabitants.

AB  - Understanding the repertoire of hunting techniques used by traditional peoples in tropical forests is crucial for recognizing the role of traditional knowledge in hunting activities, as well as assessing the impact of harvests on game species. We describe the hunting techniques used across Amazonia by Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples for hunting yellow-footed tortoises (Chelonoidis denticulatus), one of the most consumed species in the biome. We interviewed 178 local people in 25 communities living in seven study areas in the Peruvian and Brazilian Amazon. We used a Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) and Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM) to compare the hunting techniques between ethnic groups and the ages of the interviewees. Four different techniques were reported: (1) trapping with bait (46%; n = 122); (2) hunting with dogs (35%; n = 92); (3) active searching (14 %; n = 37); and (4) visiting fruiting trees (5%; n = 14). Trapping with bait was alleged to be the most cost-effective technique by 67% of the interviewees. Among the baits used, 93% involved the use of wild species as rotten meat. Hunting with dogs was also frequently cited and involved eight different methods of training. The hunting techniques recorded were not significantly different among ethnic groups or generations. The consonance among the technique repertoire likely reflects a shared knowledge still in use across different cultural groups. There is a potential for applying the hunting techniques to large scale community-based monitoring and management programs, but the impact on additional species affected, such as species intentionally captured to be used as bait, should be considered. Local assessments and community-based management plans that incorporate traditional ecological knowledge are recommended to guarantee the maintenance of livelihoods and ensure the species' conservation in Amazonia.

AB  - Objective To determine intraocular pressure (IOP) in adult yellow-footed tortoises using applanation tonometry.
   Animals Fifteen healthy adult captive yellow-footed tortoises (eight males and seven females).
   Procedures Intraocular pressures were estimated for tortoises by using an applanation tonometer after topical anesthesia. Body length, measured from nuchal to anal scutes, ranged from 27.5 to 57.2 cm. Five measurements from each eye were obtained by a single observer in an ambient temperature of approximately 30 degreesC.
   Results Mean +/- SEM IOP of 30 eyes of 15 yellow-footed tortoises was 14.2 +/- 1.2 mmHg. Range of IOP was 6-30 mmHg for tortoises. Significant differences were detected neither between right and left eyes (P = 0.357) of individual tortoises, nor between males and females (P = 0.524). Observer's readability was good (intraclass coefficient = 0.65), and IOP did not change over the ordered five measurements.
   Conclusions There was no significant difference in IOP between males and females in this specie. Tonometry values for normal eyes may represent a useful diagnostic methodology for recognition and treatment of ocular diseases in reptiles.

AB  - Chelonoidis Dcarbonaria and C. denticulata are two tortoises which are widely distributed Brazil. Although they occur sympatrically in different areas, C. carbonaria prefers open areas, while C. denticulata chooses forest areas. Significant morphological variations can be observed in these species due to the fact that they occupy a vast and environmentally diverse area. Data on shell shape of captive individuals reveal important differences between the two species, mainly in the plastron scutes, carapace width, and head length. Variation in shape is greater in C. carbonaria than in C. denticulata, which may be associated to a more elaborate and complex mating ritual. The shell shape in C. denticulata is more elongated than in C. carbonaria due to ecological habits. These aspects lead to a greater restriction in shape, limiting variation and dimorphism. In C. carbonaria, the shell opening is larger than in C. denticulata, which affords greater variation in shape. A more elongated shell facilitates movements of C. denticulata in densely forested areas. Yet, this characteristic reduces shell opening, lessening the possibilities of variation in form.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Animal oils and fats from the fishes Electrophorus electricus and Potamotrygon motoro, the reptiles Boa constrictor, Chelonoidis denticulata (Geochelone denticulata) and Melanosuchus niger and the riverine dolphin Inia geoffrensis are used as anti-inflammatory agents in the Peruvian Amazon. The aim of the study was to assess the topic anti-inflammatory effect of the oils/fats as well as to evaluate its antimicrobial activity and fatty acid composition.
   Materials and methods: The oils/fats were purchased from a traditional store at the Iquitos market of Belen, Peru. The topic anti-inflammatory effect was evaluated by the mice ear edema induced by arachidonic acid (AA) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) at the dose of 3 mg oil/ear. Indomethacine and nimesulide were used as reference anti-inflammatory drugs. The application resembles the traditional topical use of the oils. The antimicrobial effect of the oils/fats was assessed by the microdilution test against reference strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enteritidis. The fatty acid composition of the oils/fats (as methyl esters) was determined by GC and GC MS analysis after saponification.
   Results: All oils/fats showed topic anti-inflammatory activity, with better effect in the TPA-induced mice ear edema assay. The most active drugs were Potamotrygon motoro, Melanosuchus niger and Geochelone denticulata. In the AA-induced assay, the best activity was found for Potamotrygon motoro and Electrophorus electricus oil. The oil of Electrophorus electricus also showed a weak antimicrobial effect with MIC values of 250 mu g/mL against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Salmonella enteritidis-MI. The main fatty acids in the oils were oleic, palmitic and linoleic acids.
   Conclusions: Topical application of all the oils/fats investigated showed anti-inflammatory activity in the mice ear edema assay. The effect can be related with the identity and composition of the fatty acids in the samples. This study gives support to the traditional use of animal oils/fats as ant-inflammatory agents in the Peruvian Amazon. However, new alternative should be encouraged due to the conservation status of several of the animal sources of the crude drugs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The tick Amblyomma humerale Koch is endemic to South America. All host records refer to the adult stage parasitizing tortoises, mostly yellow-footed tortoise, Geochelone denticulata (L.), and red-footed tortoise, Geochelone carbonaria (Spix). The current study reports the presence of A. humerale in the state of Rondonia, Brazil. A total of 215 adult ticks (201 males, 14 females) was collected from six G. denticulata in an Indian reserve and nine Geochelone sp. in rural Monte Negro County, giving an overall mean infestation of 14.3 +/- 12.0 (range: 2-44) ticks per tortoise. Male ticks always outnumbered females on the host and nine tortoises had only male ticks. Male ticks were mostly attached in clusters on the ventral sides of the carapace near the anterior and posterior margins, and more rarely on the outer margin of the plastron. All females were found attached to the tortoise skin, at different sites such as head, neck, shoulders or legs. Male ticks were rarely observed attached to the body skin. Seven engorged nymphs collected on small vertebrates from Monte Negro County molted to adults of A. humerale. This included one nymph each on the seven-colored lizard, Plica plica (L.), green tree climber, Plica umbra (L.), and wide-foraging lizard, Kentropyx calcarata Spix, three nymphs on the common opossum, Didelphis marsupialis L., and one nymph on the silky anteater, Cyclopes didactylus L. These constitute the first host records for the immature stages of the tick A. humerale.

Ticks collected from a harpy eagle, Harpia harpyja (Linnaeus), were identified as Amblyomma cajennense (Fabricius) (16 nymphs) and Haemaphysalis juxtakochi Cooley (1 nymph). Ticks collected from a yellow-footed tortoise, Chelonoidis denticulada (Linnaeus), were identified as Amblyomma rotundatum Koch (10 females, 2 nymphs), and Amblyomma sp. (2 larvae). The present record of A. romitii is the first in the State of Rondonia, and represents the southernmost record for this tick species, indicating that its distribution area is much larger than currently recognized. Although both A. cajennense and H. juxtakochi have been reported parasitizing various bird species, we provide the first tick records on a harpy eagle. A. rotundatum is widespread in the State of Rondonia, and has been previously reported on the yellow-footed tortoise. The present records increase the tick fauna of Rondonia to 26 species.

AB  - In order to help elucidate the evolution of alpha-globins, the complete cDNA and amino acid sequences of Geochelone carbonaria and Geochelone denticulata land turtles alpha-D chains have been described. In G. carbonaria, the cDNA is 539 bp with ATG start codon located at position 46, TGA stop codon at position 469 and AATAAA polyadenylation signal at position 520. In G. denticulata, the cDNA is 536 bp with ATG start codon located at position 46, TGA stop codon at position 469 and AATAAA polyadenylation signal at position 517. Both cDNAs codify 141 amino acid residues, differing from each other in only four amino acid residues. When comparing with human Hb alpha-chain, alterations in important regions can be noted: alpha110 Ala-Gly, alpha114 Pro-Gly, alpha117 Phe-Tyr and alpha122 His-Gln. There is a high homology between the amino acids of these turtles when compared with chicken alpha-D chains, progressively decreasing when compared with human, crocodile, snake, frog and fish alpha-chains. Phylogenetic analysis of alpha-D chains shows that those of turtles are closer to those of birds than to snakes and lizards. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tetrasporocystic, dizoic oocysts of reptiles have been separated by some authors into the genera Eimeria, Choleoeimeria and Acroeimeria (Protozoa: Eimeriidae), based on the site and mode of development of their endogenous stages. The majority of Eimeria species have been, and still are, however, described on cocyst morphology alone. Four different oocysts with this basic morphology were encountered in the faeces of Brazilian tortoises, Geochelone carbonaria Spix, 1824 and are assigned to the genus Eimeria, with the view that they can readily be transferred to the genus Choleoeimeria or Acroeimeria if this is indicated by a future examination of their endogenous development. A morphological comparison distinguishes the oocysts from those of Eimeria spp., previously described in chelonids of the family Testudinidae, and the names F. amazonensis, F. carbonaria, E. carajasensis and E. wellcomei n. spp. ore proposed. Coccidial infection appears to be common in G. carbonaria, with three of seven animals examined passing oocysts. Oocysts of Isospora rodriguesae n. sp. (Protozoa: Eimeriidae) are described in the faeces of Geochelone denticulata Linnaeus, 1766. They are morphologically very different from those of Isospora testudae, Davronov, 1985 in Testudo horsfieldi. Eimeria motelo Hurkova et al., 2000, previously described in Geochelone denticulata from Peru, is here recorded in the some chelonid from Amazonion Brazil.

AB  - We conducted a population genetic analysis of the two Amazonian tortoises, Chelonoidis denticulata (n = 40) and Chelonoidis carbonaria (n = 39) in a region of sympatry within the Xingu River basin. High levels of gene flow among sampled localities indicated lack of population structure for both species. Genetic parameters indicated a moderate level of genetic diversity in C. denticulata and neutrality tests suggested that populations of this species were in demographic equilibrium with respect to mitochondrial DNA. On the other hand, C. carbonaria presented low levels of genetic diversity and a signal of population expansion. Most records of C. denticulata are from areas of humid forest while those for C carbonaria are from areas of semi-deciduous forests and transitional areas between humid and semi-deciduous forests. Therefore, the demographic expansion observed in C carbonaria population could reflect an increase in the availability of suitable habitats for this species due to anthropogenic or natural processes. Additionally, we observed haplotype sharing between these two tortoise species indicating hybridization or incomplete lineage sorting.

AB  - 1 Most previous studies of terrestrial ectotherms have emphasized the limitations of ectothermy by concentrating on small organisms, or ones inhabiting xeric environments. To investigate the potential plasticity of ectotherm behaviour in a benign environment, aspects of the behaviour and ecology of two species of tortoise (Testudinidae) were examined in a rain forest in north-western Brazil.
   2 Activity levels were monitored by a mark-recapture study and movements were examined by radiotracking and trailing several individuals simultaneously. Fifty-six tortoises were followed over the 18-month study (1442 tortoise-days).
   3 Most of the variation observed in activity levels, movement behaviour and use of area was explained at the level of individuals. The few patterns observed seemed related to reproductive biology: young individuals and adult females were active all year round, while large males were active almost exclusively during the mating season. However, except for male Geochelone carbonaria (Spix) during the mating season, individual behaviour patterns differed markedly within each species, sex and season group.
   4 We argue that the low metabolic requirements of adult tortoises, along with their low vulnerability to predation and existence in a benign environ-ment, allow individuals

AB  - Background: Ticks are arthropods that can host and transmit pathogens to wild animals, domestic animals, and even humans. The microbiome in ticks is an endosymbiotic, pathogenic and is yet to be fully understood. Results: Adult male Amblyomma scalpturatum (A. scalpturatum) and Amblyomma ovale (A. ovale) ticks were collected from Tapirus terrestris (T. terrestris) captured in the rural area of San Lorenzo Village, and males Amblyomma sabanerae were collected from Chelonoidis denticulate (C. denticulate) of the Gamita Farm in the Amazon region of Madre de Dios, Peru. The Chao1 and Shannon-Weaver analyses indicated a greater bacterial richness and diversity in male A. sabanerae (Amblyomma sabanerae; 613.65-2.03) compared to male A. scalpturatum and A. ovale (A. scalpturatum and A. ovale; 102.17-0.40). Taxonomic analyses identified 478 operational taxonomic units representing 220 bacterial genera in A. sabanerae and 86 operational taxonomic units representing 28 bacterial genera in A. scalpturatum and A. ovale. Of the most prevalent genera was Francisella (73.2%) in A. sabanerae, and Acinetobacter (96.8%) in A. scalpturatum and A. ovale to be considered as the core microbiome of A. sabanerae and A. scalpturatum/A. ovale respectively. Conclusions: We found a high bacterial diversity in male of A. sabanerae collected from C. denticulata showed prevalence of Francisella and prevalence of Acinetobacter in male A. scalpturatum and A. ovale collected from T. terrestris. The greatest bacterial diversity and richness was found in males A. sabanerae. This is the first bacterial metagenomic study performed in A. scalpturatum/A. ovale and A. sabanerae collected from T. terrestris and C. denticulata in the Peruvian jungle.

AB  - Seed dispersal capabilities by red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) and common snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) in southwestern Missouri were investigated for mulberry (Morus spp.), barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli), and curly dock (Rumex crispus). Feeding trials conducted on these seeds demonstrated that seed damage was low and percentage of germination of turtle-passed seeds did not exceed controls for any seed species tested. These turtle species are capable of dispersing mulberry, barnyardgrass, and curly dock seeds to areas near pond margins and to more distant locations during overland movements.

Among them, the bacteria Bartonella spp. and Anaplasma spp. are related to this zoonotic dynamic.ObjectiveThe primary goal of the present study was to determine the presence of pathogenic bacteria in kidney and liver tissues of Didelphis marsupialis; spleen, liver, and skin of Pecari tajacu; spleen, liver, and skin of Chelonoidis denticulata.MethodologyA PCR using universal and specific primers for 16 S rRNA, of Bartonella spp. with subsequent genetic sequencing were used.ResultsThe results in this study indicate that Bartonella vinsonni was detected in the liver tissue of Didelphis marsupialis using both universal primers and those specific for Bartonella sp. Anaplasma platys was detected at the liver and spleen level using universal primers. Additionally, Bartonella spp. was found at the liver, spleen, and skin level in Pecari tajacu using the specific primers. Finally, using the universal and specific primers at the skin level, Bartonella spp. was evident in Chelonoidis denticulata.ConclusionsThe presence of the DNA of the Bartonella vinsonii was detected at the liver tissue in Didelphis marsupialis. DNA of the Anaplasma platys and Bartonella spp. were identified at the spleen and liver level. This study also identified that DNA Bartonella spp. was detected in Pecari tajacu skin. Finally DNA of Bartonella spp. was evident in Chelonoidis denticulate skin. The findings of this study suggest that these bacteria are present in these animals and may be responsible for outbreaks.

AB  - The Amazonian tortoise Geochelone denticulata may play an important role in forest dynamics due to its highly frugivorous diet, ability to disperse viable seeds, and predilection for resting in forest gaps for thermoregulation. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the species' effectiveness as a seed disperser. We measured dispersal quantity (abundance of seeds in feces, frequency of droppings, and population density of the disperser) and dispersal quality (movement patterns, habitat use, germination rates of dispersed seeds, and recruitment probabilities of seedlings) in a SW Amazonian forest, in Peru. Population density was calculated by mark-recapture and line-transect methods. Eight individuals were radio-tracked to monitor habitat use. Diet was described from fecal samples, which were washed to count seeds and for germination experiments. Seedling survival in different environmental conditions was monitored for three plant species. Population densities with mark-recapture estimates (0.15-0.31 individuals/ha) were much higher than with line transects estimates (0.0025 individuals/ha). Diet included fruit of 55 different plant species. Dispersed seeds had high germination rates (average 76%). In spite of their low activity, we documented long seed dispersal distances (average 89.6 m). Tortoises showed a marked preference for the open-canopy swampy forest, where long term recruitment was not favorable for seedlings of the species examined. However, the high solar radiation in this forest type promoted survival of pioneer seedlings in the short term. In conclusion, while G. denticulata did not perform a very efficient role in terms of the quantity of seed dispersal, the species can be considered efficient in many aspects of dispersal quality.

AB  - The occurrence of Hepatozoon spp. in the blood cells of captive Boa constritor in captivity in the semi-arid of the Rio Grande do Norte State, Brazil, was analyzed. Blood samples from Geochelone carbonaria (n = 6), Geochelone denticulata (n = 4), Boa Constrictor (n = 7), and Tupinanbis teguixim (n = 10) were used. All snakes presented Hepatozoon spp. in their blood cells, and few erythrocytes were infected. G. carbonaria, G. denticulate, and T. teguixim were negative for Hepatozoon spp. gametocytes research. This is the first report of the occurrence of Hepatozoon spp. in captive B. constritor in the studied area.

AB  - It is the general opinion that the haemoproteid blood parasites of chelonians belong to the genus Haemoproteus. Different specific names have long been assigned to this parasite in birds, but some past authorities have accepted only a single species, H. metchnikovi, for all those haemoproteids recorded in a wide range of chelonian genera throughout the world. In the present study a comparison of one such organism in the tortoise Geochelone denticulata with another in the river turtle Peltocephalus dumerilianus, from Amazonian Brazil, has revealed clear morphological differences. These distinguish the parasites from each other, H. metchnikovi and the other named species of chelonian Haemoproteus for which adequate descriptions are available. We have assigned to them the names Haemoproteus geochelonis n.sp. and Haemoproteus peltocephali n.sp.

AB  - The Amazonian tortoise, Geochelone denticulata, has been classified as vulnerable; nevertheless, necessary ecological and demographic information to formulate conservation plans is limited. In this study we present data on population density, habitat preference, diet and morphological measurements of a population inhabiting a lowland rainforest in Colombia. We used line transect methods to estimate population density over three different years, and we measured and marked 73 individuals in two additional years. The estimated population density based on 158 encounters was similar over the three years (41 +/- 20, 38 +/- 6, 34 +/- 8 ind/km(2) +/- SE, respectively). However, we found marked differences between seasons within years, because it was easy to detect individuals (particularly males) during mating periods. There was no evidence of large scale seasonal migrations; thus, it is possible that individuals were missed in the non-reproductive season and therefore our figures may underestimate population size. For the same reason, sex ratios during the mating season may be more biased towards males than for whole year estimates (1.7:1 vs. 1.2:1) Monthly density estimates were significantly correlated with mating frequency and with estimates of fruit abundance, but were not associated with rainfall, temperature or sun radiance. These results suggest that males might use available energy from fruit to travel extensively during the mating season in search of females. However, the most productive forest type in terms of fruit was not preferred by tortoises, to the contrary, they were more commonly encountered in forests with a high proportion A gaps. Males tended to have larger and more elongated bodies than females. This result supports the hypothesis that since males must travel more in search of mates, it is an advantage for them to have an elongated carapace in order to move through cense understory. More ecological information is required from other geographical locations to establish which ecological variables are most important in determining the carrying capacity for terrestrial tortoises. So far the demographic structure of the populations suggest that predation of young individuals plays a major role.

AB  - Thiol groups of hemoglobin and blood glutathione are higher in Geochelone carbonaria than in Geochelone denticulata. Exposure of stripped hemolysate of both tortoises to terc-butyl hydroperoxide, resulted in a higher ferroheme oxidation of G. denticulata hemoglobin. In this example glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase, were not active due to the absence of GSH and NADPH, suggesting that the thiol groups of G. carbonaria hemoglobin act as antioxidant, similar to GSH. In the total hemolysate, however, where the antioxidant enzymes are active, both species showed similar levels of hemoglobin oxidation, suggesting that the protective effect of thiol groups of hemoglobin are less effective for heme protection. The activity of glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase was higher in erythrocytes of G. denticulata and the activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase was higher in erythrocytes of G. carbonaria.

AB  - In Iquitos (Peru), the meat of Cuniculus paca, Pecan tajacu, Tayassu pecari and Chelonoidis denticulatus are consumed in large quantities, however, there is no complete bromatological analysis or updated studies of the bacterial load and presence of coronavirus. Our objective was to know the consumption and the microbiological and bromatological status of wild meat during the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual interviews were conducted with 213 people between May and June 2020 in Iquitos; for each species, four 500-g meat samples were used for bacteriological and bromatological analysis, and a 500-g meat sample per species was used to search for coronaviruses from the Belen and Modelo markets. We found that wild meat represents 4% of the protein source, its consumption is independent of educational and economic factors, most people like this meat and believe that its consumption does not spread coronavirus. This meat did not have coronaviruses and presented less bacterial load than other products of greater consumption in the markets studied. Likewise, it had low fat content, low phosphorus/protein ratio, high riboflavin and calcium content. That is, this meat during the pandemic was healthy and nutritious.

AB  - Sulfhydryl groups are important to avoid oxidative damage to the cell. In RBC, tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tert-BOOH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are capable of oxidizing heme and promoting lipid peroxidation. H2O2 caused greater oxidation of heme than tert-BOOH, although the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups was similar. Geochelone carbonaria Hb, a rich sulfhydryl protein, inhibited the TBA-reactive substances formation of human erythrocytes exposed to tert-BOOH by about 30%; this decrease was smaller with Geochelone denticulata Hb. Sulfhydryl reagents diminished the number of reactive sulfhydryl groups in the G. carbonaria Hb resulting in a decrease of its antioxidant power, suggesting the involvement of sulfhydryls of Hb in the protection against lipid peroxidation.

AB  - The hematology of wild and captive animals is essential for obtaining details about species and represents a simple method of diagnosing disease and determining prognosis. Few studies have described the morphology of chelonian blood cells, which are more common in sea and freshwater turtle species. Thus, in order to further our understanding and recognition of different chelonian cells types, the present study aimed to describe blood cells from the two species of Brazilian tortoises, Chelonoidis carbonarius and C. denticulatus. Cytochemical analysis of tortoise blood tissue with Panotico, made it possible to describe all the of the chelonian cell types (with the exception of thrombocytes): erythrocytes, agranular leukocytes (monocytes and lymphocytes), and granular leukocytes (eosinophils, heterophils, basophils, and azurophils). These data are of high importance for establishing hematological profiles of Brazilian tortoises and reptiles. Therefore, based on our results and on comparative analyses with data from the literature for other reptile species, we can conclude that the blood cells described for Brazilian tortoises are found in all species of reptiles that have been analyzed thus far, and may be characterized and used as a comparative parameter between different groups to evaluate the health status of these animals.

AB  - The aim of this survey was to verify the occurrence of anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies in captive animals in the Parque Zoobotanico Arruda Camara, Joao Pessoa, Paraiba State, Northeastern Brazil. Blood samples were collected from 49 animals: 26 mammals of the species Sapajus libidinosus, Cebus flavius, Saimiri sciureu, Coendu sp., Pseudalopex vetulus, Leopardus pardalis, Leopardus tigrinus, Galactitis vitata, Eira barbara, Nasua nasua, Tayassu tajacu and Ratus norvegicus; 10 birds of the species Penelope jacucaca, Pavo cristatus, Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus, Ara chlorothpterus, Pionites leucogaster, Polyborus plancus, Geranoaetus melanoleucus and Urubitinga urubitinga; and 13 reptiles of the species Caiman latirostris, Paleosuchus trigonatus, Caiman crocodilus, Tupinabis merinae, Tupinambis teguixin, Boa constrictor, Corallus hortulanus, Python molurus, Bufocephala vanderhaegei, Geochelone denticulata and Geochelone carboraria. Sera were examined by the microscopic agglutination teste (MAT) using 24 serovars as antigens and cut-off point of 1:100. One ocelot (Leopardo pardalis) presented positive reaction for the Icterohaemorrhagiae serovar with titer of 100, however, it did not show any clinical sign of the infection. Sinantropic rodents are the main reservoirs of this serovar, which suggests the need of maintenance and continuous evaluation of rodent control programs.

AB  - The role of red-footed tortoises (Geochelone carbonaria) and yellow-footed tortoises (G. denticulata) as seed dispersal agents was investigated in northwestern Brazil from 5 to 26 January 2002 by analyzing fecal samples for frequency and viability of seed species and estimating daily displacement of tortoises from recaptured and thread-trailed individuals. Fourteen of 19 fecal samples contained a total of 646 seeds represented by 11 plant species. The most abundant species was Ficus sp. (N = 400) with 100 percent of seeds viable, followed by Aechmea sp. (N = 88) with 93 percent of seeds viable, and Genipa americana (N = 59) with 91 percent of seeds viable. Mean minimum retention time of seeds was 1.6 d and mean daily displacement of tortoises based on recaptured (N = 7) and thread-trailed tortoises (N = 2) was 57 m. Thus, the diversity and proportion of viable seeds consumed by tortoises, combined with the seed retention times and daily movements, suggest they may be effective dispersal agents. These preliminary findings warrant further investigation into the ecological role of these tortoises in Neotropical ecosystems and their contribution to the maintenance of species diversity and forest structure.

   Parasitological material collected in research activity on vertebrate parasitic fauna at Lima, Peru, ticks were found attached on the carapace, plastron, and skin of tortoises. A total of 28 ticks, eight females and 20 males, were removed manually from the hosts and they were classified as Amblyomma (Cernyomma) extraoculatum. One of the males had a malformation in the opisthosoma which was antisymitric with five festoons on the left side and, on the right side, the fifth decorative festoon was trapeziform, the first and second festoons were normal, but the third and fourth ones were short, very broad and partially divided into two sections in each of them. This is the first report of this malformation in A. (C.) extraoculantum in Peru.

AB  - Standard line-transect census techniques were deployed to generate a checklist and quantify the abundance of medium and large-bodied vertebrate species in forest areas of eastern Amazonia with and without a history of reduced-impact logging (RIL). Three areas were allocated a total of 1,196.9 km of line-transect census effort. Sampling was conducted from April to June 2012 and from April to August 2013, and detected 29 forest vertebrate species considered in this study belonging to 15 orders, 20 families and 28 genera. Additionally, eight species were recorded outside census walks through direct and indirect observations. Of this total, six species are considered vulnerable according to IUCN (Ateles paniscus, Myrmecophaga tridactyla, Priodontes maximus, Tapirus terrestris, Tayassu peccary, Chelonoidis denticulata). Observed species richness ranged from 21 to 24 species in logged and unlogged areas, and encounter rates along transects were highly variable between treatments. However, the relative abundance of species per transect did not differ between transects in logged and unlogged forests. Of the species detected during censuses, only three showed different relative abundance between the two treatments (Saguinus midas, Tinamus spp. and Dasyprocta leporina). Our results show that the effect of RIL forest management was a relatively unimportant determinant of population abundance for most medium and large vertebrates over the time period of the survey.

AB  - Home range, habitat use, and seasonal behavior of the Central African forest-dwelling hingeback tortoises Kinixys erosa and K. homeana were quantified by radio tracking 3 translocated and 6 resident individuals for up to 2.3 years in southwestern Cameroon where the two species are sympatric. Individuals of both species varied widely in total and seasonal minimum convex polygon home range estimates (1.1-47.8 ha). Harmonic surface area home range estimates, however, show that most of each tortoise's locations occurred within a relatively small core area representing 5%-25% of an individual's total range. Males of both species had the largest home ranges, and specimens tracked for more than one year showed a decrease in yearly home range size estimates. Considerable overlap of total home ranges but little overlap of core areas exist among individuals of species. Kinixys homeana was located more frequently in forest gaps than was K. erosa, but substantial overlap occurred of habitats and microhabitats used between species. Tortoises tended to gain weight at the beginning and end of the rainy season, and lost weight. through the middle of each season.

AB  - Leishmaniasis is a disease of public importance with a complex transmission cycle. A quantitative PCR was developed by using the small subunit of the ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rRNA) as a DNA target, which is conserved in all Leishmania species. A TaqMan (R) probe was designed to have a high specificity. In all, 22 out of 23 (95.7%) ticks classified as R. microplus tested positive for Leishmania sp. The quantification was between 34.1 and 2197.1 parasites per tick in a range of 12 to 769 fg/uL. In addition, 9 out of 10 (90%) ticks classified as Amblyomma sabanerae tested positive for Leishmania sp. The quantification was between 448.6 and 5428.6 parasites per tick in a range of 157 to 1900 fg/mu L. Leishmania sp. was identified in very high percentages in Rhipicephalus microplus and Amblyomma sabanerae from wild Pecari tajacu and Chelonoidis denticulata, in quantities of 34.1 and 5428.6 parasites per arthropod, and this could suggest that the ticks were parasitized by sucking blood from the animals from which they were collected. This is the first report about Leishmania parasites found in wild Rhipicephalus microplus and Amblyomma sabanerae, adding new information about the distribution and epidemiology of the parasite in sylvatic areas.

AB  - Animal personality, the consistent between-individual differences in e.g., risk-taking, exploration, antipredator or mating behaviours, has major impacts on the fitness of individuals in many species. Understanding how to quantify animal personality should help us predicting how species interact with their environment and with the current environmental changes. We adapted existing behavioural assays to quantify the personality of two Brazilian tortoises, Chelonoidis carbonarius and C. denticulatus. We recorded behavioural responses to stress, novel environments, novel objects and social encounters. Behavioural components were consistent through time, supporting the existence of personality in both species. These behaviours were further correlated and could be summarized into two behavioural axes with recognizable biological meanings. One axis was related to responses to threats and novelty, as well as interest and interaction behaviours towards conspecifics and one to submission. The behavioural dimensions were similar in both species, suggesting that they share the same behavioural syndromes, but C. carbonarius had greater frequency of risk taking behaviours. This pattern can be related to differences in resource availabilities and predator pressures in their respective natural habitats. Within each species, however, the individual variation in morphology only had a weak effect on personality and males tended to show more signs of submission. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of habitat features (resource availabilities and predation risk) on individual behavioural variation in each species in order to improve conservation and translocations programs.

AB  - Wildlife exploitation has nutritional, medicinal, luxury, sociocultural, and financial significance for human societies. Yet, it also risks undesired outcomes for conservation, animal welfare, and public health. Although it is prohibited in urban markets, the wildlife trade in Peru is poorly monitored, and practiced openly. To identify those species most likely to be affected, we investigated the trade in live wild animals and their derivatives at the Belen Market, and additional smaller open-air markets, which together make Iquitos the largest and most important wildlife trade hubs in the Peruvian Amazon. Specifically, we asked what wild animals or animal products were most profitable, what were they used for, and which wild animals were perceived by vendors to have increased most in rarity. Vendors provided 44 local animal names, from which we inferred an estimated 205 species. Nine per cent (n = 19) of these inferred species are categorised on the IUCN Red List as threatened; 35% (n = 71) are categorised as declining. We found that wild meat/food was the most frequently stated purpose of sale of wildlife, followed by pets, spiritual/belief-based use, traditional medicine, and decorative use. The most commonly cited most profitable wildlife derivatives were 'lowland paca', 'yellow footed tortoise', and 'collared peccary'. A significant positive correlation was found between the most profitable species and those that are becoming increasingly rare. Further research focused on the actual impacts on wildlife, the socioeconomic importance of this trade, the societal pressures driving consumer demand, and the risks to public health is warranted.

AB  - From 2005 to 2009, 147 ticks found on 32 wild animals from or referred to two zoobotanical parks (Parque ZoobotA cent nico Arruda CA cent mara and Parque Estadual Dois Irmos) located in northeastern Brazil were identified. Ticks found on two veterinarians working in one of the parks (i.e., Parque Estadual Dois Irmos), after return from forested areas within the park's territory, were also identified. The following tick-host associations were recorded: Amblyomma fuscum Neumann on Boa constrictor L.; Amblyomma longirostre Koch on Ramphastos vitellinus ariel Vigors and Coendou prehensilis (L.); Amblyomma varium Koch on Bradypus variegates Schinz; Amblyomma rotundatum Koch on Chelonoidis carbonaria (Spix), Chelonoidis denticulata (L.), Micrurus ibiboboca (Merrem), Python molurus bivittatus Kuhl, Iguana iguana (L.) and B. variegatus; Amblyomma nodosum Neumann on Myrmecophaga tridactyla L. and Tamandua tetradactyla (L.); and Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Latreille) on Nasua nasua (L.). The ticks found on the veterinarians were identified as nine Amblyomma larvae. The presence of Am. nodosum in Pernambuco and Am. rotundatum and Am. varium in Paraiba is recorded for the first time and the occurrence of Am. longirostre in Pernambuco is confirmed. Ramphastos vitellinus ariel is a new host record for Am. longirostre whereas M. ibiboboca and B. variegatus are new host records for Am. rotundatum. Finally, the human parasitism by Amblyomma ticks is reported for the first time in Pernambuco, highlighting the potential of tick-borne pathogen transmission in this state.

AB  - Long-term memory can be adaptive as it allows animals to retain information that is crucial for survival, such as the appearance and location of key resources. This is generally examined by comparing choices of stimuli that have value to the animal with those that do not; however, in nature choices are rarely so clear cut. Animals are able to assess the relative value of a resource via direct comparison, but it remains unclear whether they are able to retain this information for a biologically meaningful amount of time. To test this, captive red-footed tortoises (Chelonoidis carbonaria) were first trained to associate visual cues with specific qualities and quantities of food, and their preferences for the different reward values determined. They were then retested after an interval of 18 months. We found that the tortoises were able to retain the information they had learned about the cues as indicators of relative reward values over this interval, demonstrating a memory for the relative quantity and quality of food over an extended period of time. This is likely to impact directly on an animal's foraging decisions, such as the exploitation of seasonally varying resources, with obvious fitness implications for the individual; however, the implications may also extend to the ecological interactions in which the animal is involved, affecting processes such as herbivory and seed dispersal.

AB  - An examination of the leaves of several native and exotic Solanum species revealed that they all possessed glandular and non-glandular trichomes. The density of glandular trichomes was, however, very much lower on the leaves of the indigenous species than on the leaves of a weed species, Solanum sisymbriifolium Lamarck, and two other South American Solanum species. This difference could have contributed to the depauperate faunas supported by the exotic species. The morphology and behaviour of an indigenous Solanum-feeding tortoise beetle, Conchyloctenia tigrina Oliver (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), and a South American tortoise beetle, Gratiana spadicea (Klug) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), were compared. The study revealed that while the exudate produced by the glandular trichomes afforded S. sisymbriifolium a level of resistance to C. tigrina, it is probably only one of the factors limiting the recruitment of indigenous herbivores onto S. sisymbriifolium.

AB  - In order to determine the main anatomopathological findings of Testudines necropsied in the Distrito Federal, all necropsy records performed at the "Laboratorio de Patologia Veterinaria" of the "Universidade de Brasilia" (LPV-UnB) on Testudines during the period from January 2008 to July 2020 were reviewed. The 72 cases reviewed were grouped and classified according to species, sex, origin, season of occurrence, and diagnosis. In 69.44% of the cases the species was informed in the necropsy protocols, which included Phrynops geoffroanus (38%), Trachemys dorbigni (36%), Chelonoidis carbonaria (14%), Chelonoidis denticulata (10%) and Podocnemis expansa (2%). In 30.55% of the cases this parameter was not informed and were classified only as Testudines. In 41.66% of the cases the sex was informed, being female 22.22%, male 19.44%, and 58.33% were not informed. Of these animals 79.16% were from environmental agencies and 20.84% from zoos and/or guardians. In 70.83% of the animals analyzed they were directly related to the autumn and winter seasons, with June being the most frequent month (29.17%). The conclusive diagnosis was possible in 68.05% of the cases. The category of disorders caused by injurious agents (48.97%) was the most prevalent, followed by inflammatory disorders (32.65%) and nutritional and metabolic disorders (28.57%). The main diagnoses were carapace and/or plastron fracture with 30.61%, hepatic steatosis (20.40%) and pneumonia (10.22%). Most cases of carapace or plastron fracture and hepatic steatosis occurred in animals from environmental agencies.

AB  - Most of the 42 living species of tortoise (Testudinidae) are herbivorous, feeding largely on vascular plants, with the exception of the genus Kinixys, which is omnivorous. A comparison of Kinixys spekii and Geochelone pardalis showed the following significant differences. The large intestine was shorter in K. spekii (86% of plastron length and 1.8% of body mass) than in G. pardalis (246 and 2.5%) and held a smaller proportion of the total gut contents (44 and 62%, respectively). The apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) of organic matter was lower in K. spekii (77%) than in G. pardalis (82%) fed kale; the ADC of holocellulose was higher and did not differ between the two species. Kinixys spekii did not readily consume grass, which is more difficult to digest than kale; the ADC of organic matter was 64% in G. pardalis. The time to first excretion (t(0)) was lower in K. spekii (2.2 days) than in G. pardalis (3.8 days). Other measures of retention time (t(50), t(max), and (t) over bar) did not differ between the species, or between the two diets in G. pardalis. Analysis of published data on chelonians fed foliage shows that the ratio of large intestine to small intestine lengths is significantly related to gut retention time (r = 0.88) but not to the ADC (r = -0.28). Thus, although the short large intestine of K. spekii slightly reduces the gut retention time and digestibility of dicotyledonous leaves, the most important effect is a low ability to process grass and other coarse vegetation.

AB  - The Brazilian Testudinidae family is widespread across South America. It includes Chelonoidis denticulatus, the largest tortoise in South America and Chelonoidis carbonarius, found mostly in the north and northwestern part of the continent. Using hemoglobin to identify species is cheaper than other methods such as DNA sequencing and can offer useful information, since the hemoglobin molecule is a well-preserved protein chain during the evolution of species. Thus, in order to establish a hemoglobin profile for the Brazilian Testudinidae C. denticulatus, C. carbonarius and morphotype 1, hemoglobin electrophoresis was performed at acid pH in phosphate agar and at alkaline pH in cellulose acetate, in order to visualize the specific fractions of each species. High performance liquid chromatography was used for the quantification of fractions. For an in-depth analysis and better detailing of the hemoglobin profile of the species, polypeptide chain electrophoresis was performed at acid and alkaline pH. We observed differences in the hemoglobin profiles of C. denticulatus in relation to C. carbonarius and morphotype 1, which suggests that this methodology, not common in taxonomic studies, can help determine relationships between species, since hemoglobins are proteins with well-preserved genes. We found differences in hemoglobin mobility between C. denticulatus, C. carbonarius and morphotype 1 in electrophoresis at alkaline pH, however, the behavior of globin chains was similar between the three groups. High performance liquid chromatography showed different retention times in the globin fractions of C. denticulatus and C. carbonarius, but not between C. carbonarius and morphotype 1, indicating that, possibly, the divergence time between C. carbonarius and morphotype 1 is more recent than the divergence between C. denticulatus and C. carbonarius, due to the highly conserved character of this functional protein. Thus, considering the high degree of conservation of hemoglobins in vertebrates, and the differences observed in electrophoresis at alkaline pH and HPLC, we infer that C. carbonarius and morphotype 1 present a common branch.

AB  - Red-footed Tortoises (Chelonoidis carbonaria Spix, 1824) raised as pets and voluntarily handed over to environmental officers by their owners or apprehended by officers represent a large contingent of animals that overfill triage centres in Brazil. There is no consensus on the fate of these animals, and their numbers continue growing. In this study, we evaluated the movement patterns of C. carbonaria originating from triage centres in areas of cocoa plantations and forest remnants to define their home range and dispersion. After 120 days of quarantine and acclimatisation, eight C. carbonaria adults were released and monitored via radio telemetry for 10 months. The radio transmitters of two individuals presented problems, and consequently, it was not possible to track these individuals. Five individuals remained in an area of 7.75 ha 10 months after release, avoiding contact with humans after the first three months. The greatest problems were the proximity of individuals to inhabited areas in the first three months after release, the death of two individuals, and the escape of one individual. After the experiment, the animals were sent back to the triage centre. Our results suggest that a proportion of the animals in the triage centres are able to survive in natural conditions. Considering their survival and fidelity to the release site, the translocation of animals described herein should be considered partially successful. However, if this measure is adopted, it must be preceded by studies of the animals' origins and by a rigorous genetic, sanitary and behavioural analysis of each individual.

AB  - We propose that an understanding of animal learning and memory is critical to predicting the impacts of animals on plant populations through processes such as seed dispersal, pollination and herbivory. Focussing on endozoochory, we review the evidence that animal memory plays a role in seed dispersal, and present a model which allows us to explore the fundamental consequences of memory for this process. We demonstrate that decision-making by animals based on their previous experiences has the potential to determine which plants are visited, which fruits are selected to be eaten from the plant and where seeds are subsequently deposited, as well as being an important determinant of animal survival. Collectively, these results suggest that the impact of animal learning and memory on seed dispersal is likely to be extremely important, although to date our understanding of these processes suffers from a conspicuous lack of empirical support. This is partly because of the difficulty of conducting appropriate experiments but is also the result of limited interaction between plant ecologists and those who work on animal cognition. We believe that an improved understanding of the effects of animal memory in endozoochorous interactions will allow better prediction of the impacts of ecosystem changes such as habitat fragmentation, introductions of novel species of plants and animals and reintroductions of animal populations to areas from which they have been extirpated, and hope that the ideas we put forward here provide an impetus for further work in this area.

AB  - Seed dispersal by frugivores is essential in plant life cycles, with birds and mammals the principal and well studied dispersal agents. However, there is an increasing recognition that terrestrial tortoises could also be considered important seed dispersers in many ecosystems. The red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonaria) is one of the largest terrestrial tortoises in South America and is thought to disperse large seeds. However, little is known about their role as seed dispersers, and their potential use as restorers of defaunated areas. Here, we assessed the maximum width of seeds this species could ingest, the mean gut retention time (GRT), and the post consumption germination capacity for tropical fruit species. Forty different fruit species were offered to eight captive individuals, obtaining a maximum seed width swallowed of 23 mm. We used four native plant species to measure the GRT within four tortoises, and we found a mean retention time of 18.92 & PLUSMN; 4.81 days. We also found that sex is an important indicator of GRT, with females presenting longer retention periods. This novel finding may be due to the higher metabolic defecating and dispersing rates of males. Although germination proportions varied between the four plant species used in the experiment, overall defecated seeds germinated faster than control seeds. We conclude that red-footed tortoises are potentially important seed dispersers due to their ability to swallow a large quantity and size of seeds while accelerating seed germination rates. This species should be considered a viable ecological substitute for large frugivores in rewilding projects, as C. carbonaria performs similar functions to large dispersers that have been extirpated due to defaunation processes.

AB  - Most studies on seed dispersal in time have focused on seed dormancy and the physiological triggers for germination. However, seed dispersed by animals with low metabolic and moving rates, and long gut-passage times such as terrestrial turtles, could be considered another type of dispersal in time. This study tests the hypothesis that seeds dispersed in time may lower predation rates. We predicted that seeds deposited below parent trees after fruiting fall has finished is advantageous to minimize seed predators and should show higher survival rates. Four Amazonian plant species. Dicranostyles ampta. Oenocarpus bataua,Guatteria atabapensis and Ocotea floribunda, were tested for seed survival probabilities in two periods: during fruiting and 10-21 days after fruiting. Experiments were carried out in two biological stations located in the Colombian Amazon (Caparu and Zafire Biological Stations). Seed predation was high and mainly caused by non-vertebrates. Out of the four plant species tested, only Guatteria atabapensis supported the time escape hypothesis. For this species, seed predation by vertebrates after the fruiting period increased (from 4.1% to 9.2%) while seed predation by non-vertebrates decreased (from 54.0% to 40.2%). In contrast, seed predation by vertebrates and by non-vertebrates after the fruiting period in D. ampla increased (from 7.9% to 22.8% and from 40.4% to 50.6%, respectively), suggesting predator satiation. Results suggest that for some species dispersal in time could be advantageous to avoid some type of seed predators. Escape in time could be an additional dimension in which seeds may reach adequate sites for recruitment. Thus, future studies should be address to better understand the survival advantages given by an endozoochory time-dispersal process. Rev. Biol. Trop. 59 (4): 1795-1803. Epub 2011 December 01.

AB  - In the present paper, the history of the chelonian collection of the Oxford University Museum is summarized and extant type specimens are identified. Currently, there are 46 name-bearing types of 25 chelonian taxa and paralectotypes of three taxa described by Georg Baur, Thomas Bell, Andre Marie Constant Dumeril & Gabriel Bibron, and John Edward Gray from the families Emydidae, Geoemydidae, Testudinidae, Chelidae, and Pelomedusidae. Among the name-bearing types, there are holotypes of eight taxa (Cyclemys bellii Gray, 1863; Emys speciosa var. levigata Gray, 1831; Phrynops bellii Gray, 1844; Rhinoclemys bellii Gray, 1863; Sternothaerus leachianus Bell, 1825; Sternothaerus trifasciatus Bell, 1825; Testudo hercules var. truncata Gray, 1831; Testudo tentoria Bell, 1828) and one lectotype is of Pyxis arachnoides Bell, 1827. Two additional holotypes or syntypes are of Terrapene maculata Bell, 1825 and Terrapene nebulosa Bell, 1825, and 35 syntypes represent 14 taxa (Cyclemys orbiculata Bell, 1834; Emys concentrica var. polita Gray, 1831; Emys crassicollis Gray, 1831; Emys decussata Gray, 1831; Emys hamiltonii Gray, 1831; Emys irrigata Dumeril & Bibron, 1835; Emys speciosa Gray, 1831; Emys spinosa Gray, 1831; Emys tectum Gray, 1830; Emys thurjii Gray, 1831; Kinixys castanea Bell, 1827; Kinixys homeana Bell, 1827; Testudo actinodes Bell, 1828; Testudo guntheri Baur, 1889). Three paralectotypes are of Emys dentata Gray, 1831, eight paralectotypes are of Emys vulgaris Gray, 1831, and one paralectotype is of Pyxis arachnoides Bell, 1827. Except the syntype of Testudo guntheri Baur, 1889, originating from the college of Christ Church, Oxford, all type specimens belong to the former collection of Thomas Bell that was transferred to Oxford in 1862. Testudo guntheri Baur, 1889 is regarded as nomen dubium because it was based on specimens without locality data.
