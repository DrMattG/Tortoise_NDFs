AB  - The release of tortoises after confinement and treatment in rehabilitation centres includes the risk that released individuals may infect wild conspecifics with foreign parasites and other pathogens. The recent monitoring of the release of rehabilitated leopard tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis) onto private land in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa, revealed that the health-checking protocol at the wildlife rehabilitation centre was inadequate. As a result the provincial conservation authority placed a moratorium on further leopard tortoise releases until a comprehensive health-checking protocol was in place. This protocol is detailed here to ensure the success of the release of confiscated and rehabilitated leopard tortoises, and that this does not come at cost to the wild leopard tortoise populations.

AB  - Radio-tracking studies of African tortoises have elucidated differences in spatial ecology in differing habitats. Our study aimed to demonstrate such patterns by radio tracking the Leopard Tortoise Stigmochelys pardalis in a subtropical savanna, northeast Swaziland. Activity of tracked tortoises was correlated with minimum temperatures and greater in the warm wet months compared with the cool, dry months. All tracked tortoises, however, remained active throughout the cool months, and none were observed entering a burrow or any other hibernaculum. The tortoises typically moved 0-89 m per day, with maximum daily movement of over 300 m. A dry river bed and game viewing road did not appear to obstruct the movement of the tortoises.

AB  - The leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis) is the largest of southern Africa's 13 tortoise species, and occurs in a variety of habitats from arid and semi-arid areas to mesic grassveld, savanna and bushveld. Seasonal activity patterns of S. pardalis were investigated as a function of rainfall, sex, time of day, temperature and time after sunrise on farmland in the semi-arid Nama-Karoo, South Africa. We predicted that because of seasonal rainfall, and subsequent increase in the food available, activity patterns of leopard tortoises would vary greatly among seasons, but that the primary constraint on activity levels within a season would be ambient temperature. Type of activity, time of day that the activity was performed, and the frequency that each activity was performed, differed among seasons. There was no overall seasonal difference in the level of activity with sex, but in certain seasons and with regard to specific activities, there were significant differences between the sexes. Diel activity was primarily bimodal in summer and autumn, and unimodal in winter and spring, with non-thermoregulatory activities being performed primarily in the afternoon. There was a positive correlation between number of tortoises caught and rainfall per season, but activity levels and number of tortoises walking and feeding was not correlated with seasonal rainfall. Leopard tortoise activity behaviours responded to ambient temperature, but results indicate that activity is also initiated by the time since sunrise.

AB  - Cases of femoral head and neck excision arthroplasty are infrequently reported in reptiles, and details of surgical technique and clinical outcome in chelonia are lacking. An adult female leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis) was presented with chronic non-weight-bearing lameness of the left hind limb. Examination and radiography were consistent with coxofemoral luxation, and as a result of the chronic presentation, surgical intervention was recommended. A cranial approach to the joint via the prefemoral fossa afforded good surgical exposure. A depressed lytic acetabular lesion was noted during the procedure, postulated to be a result of abnormal wear from the luxated femoral head. A fiberglass prop was used during recovery to allow extension of the limb without full weight-bearing. Lameness persisted postoperatively, but limb usage significantly improved.

AB  - Although many reptiles, including tortoises, may be equipped morphologically to discriminate colors, there is very little experimental evidence that reptiles distinguish among hues and levels of saturation and brightness. Visual abilities or color (hue) discrimination have not been investigated for most tortoise species. In a behavioral experiment to test what visual cues are important, juvenile Leopard Tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis) approached the colors red, light green, and olive most often, raising important questions regarding plant color and selection by Leopard Tortoises.

AB  - Establishing body mass from skeletal remains of an animal is of importance to researchers in the fields of ecology, palaeontology and archaeozoology. Establishing such standards requires that different body parts follow allometric growth curves, and that one can access a sufficiently large sample of individuals of known size and weight for the target species. Here, we have used data collected from modern living and dead leopard tortoises Stigmochelys pardalis (Bell, 1928), to reconstruct body size and mass from measurements taken on individual postcranial bones. The results show high correlations in both mass and size for various dimensions taken on most skeletal elements, enabling reconstruction of these parameters from individual skeletal measurements. To highlight the application of such data to fossil fauna, allometric equations derived from regression analyses of the modern animals were applied to a sample of Later Stone Age (ca. 10,000 BP to present) leopard tortoise remains from Wonderwerk Cave located in the central interior of South Africa. Results for this archaeological sample show significant changes in size and body mass over time. These best correlate with shifts in paleoenvironmental conditions rather than with anthropogenic pressures that have commonly been implicated in size reduction or biased sex ratios in tortoise populations.

AB  - Secondary nutritional metabolic bone disease was diagnosed in a gravid leopard tortoise (Geochelone pardalis pardalis). Diagnosis was based upon history, physical examination, hematology, plasma biochemistry, and radiography. Despite induced oviposition and treatment of metabolic bone disease for 8 wk, the tortoise's condition deteriorated. Repeat radiographs demonstrated gaseous intestinal distention. Oral administration of metoclopramide and mineral oil failed to stimulate defecation. Persistence of the ileus pattern prompted utilization of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT). MRI demonstrated brightly enhanced loops of mineral oil-filled small bowel and preovulatory follicles. CT demonstrated dystrophic calcification of the left hepatic lobe and preovulatory follicles and the typical reticular pattern of chelonian lung. The interstitial septa were caused by pulmonary vasculature or bands of smooth muscle.

AB  - An approximately 20-year-old, female Leopard tortoise (Geochelone pardalis pardalis) was presented with dypsnea, wheezing, anorexia and depression. Whole body radiographs revealed generalized diffuse unstructured 'interstitial lung pattern' with thickened pulmonary septae while computed tomography (CT) showed emphysematous lung parenchyma and thickened pulmonary septae bordered by irregular ground-glass opacity with smaller areas of 'honeycombing'. These imaging findings together with histopathologic findings were compatible with chronic, extensive 'interstitial' pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - Six adult (three female and three male) leopard tortoises (Testudo pardalis) were studied to document the radiographic anatomy of the gastrointestinal tract and the transit time of barium sulfate. Tortoises were chemically immobilized with succinylcholine and dosed orally with barium contrast suspension. Both dorsoventral and lateral radiographs were taken. The lateral radiographs were extremely difficult to interpret because of the overlapping of the gastrointestinal tract and other soft tissue organs. Complete gastric emptying occurred between 5 and 9 hr after barium administration. Barium entered the small intestine at 0.21 hr and the large intestine between 5 and 8 hr. The contrast material began to exit the colon between 144 and 166 hr.

AB  - Sighting frequency and food habits of the leopard tortoise (Geochelone pardalis) were studied in northern Tanzania from October 1993 to June 1996. Sighting frequency varied significantly between protected (0.22 mhr(-1)) and unprotected sites (0.59 mhr(-1)), and between Arusha (0.27 mhr(-1)) and Serengeti sites (0.56 mhr(-1)).
   The tortoise diet comprised mostly plants (97.8%) and rarely inorganic matter (2.2%). A total of 47 plant species from 21 families was eaten. Forbs made up 74.5% of the plant items and monocots the remainder. Succulents contributed 51.0% of the plant items eaten while grasses and legumes accounted for 16.8% and 13.5%, respectively. Some plant items were eaten more frequently than their occurrence in the habitats.

AB  - Nine acaricides (amitraz, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, cyfluthrin, fipronil, lindane, permethrin, phenothrin, and pyrethrins) were studied for their efficacy in killing the African tortoise tick (Amblyomma marmoreum). Only four of the acaricides (chlorpyrifos, cyfluthrin, lindane, and permethrin) produced 100% mortality within 24 hr of application, and only two (cyfluthrin and permethrin) continued to cause 100% mortality when diluted to as low as 1:10,000. Five of the acaricides (amitraz, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, cyfluthrin, and permethrin) were studied for toxicity to the leopard tortoise (Geochelone pardalis), the most common host of A. marmoreum. The results indicate that cyfluthrin and permethrin, which were herein found to be the two most effective acaricides for control of A. marmoreum, are also the safest acaricides; for use on leopard tortoises.

Some of the affected leopard tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis) from this group showed respiratory signs. Samples were collected from one of the ill tortoises, and a Mycoplasma spp. and a herpesvirus were detected by PCR. Sequencing of a portion of the DNA polymerase gene of the herpesvirus showed 99% identity with testudinid herpesvirus 4, previously described only once in a bowsprit tortoise (Chersina angulata) in the United States.

Indications for the same phenomenon in other tortoise species (Galapagos giant tortoises, G nigra, Spur-thighed tortoises, Testudo poem; Desert tortoises, Gopherus agassizi) were found in the literature. The cause of the high growth rate most likely is the constant provision with highly digestible food of low fiber content Increased growth rates are suspected to have negative consequences such as obesity, high mortality, gastrointestinal illnesses, renal diseases. "pyramiding," fibrous osteodystrophy or metabolic bone disease The apparently widespread occurrence of high growth rates in intensively managed tortoises underlines how easily ectothermic animals can be oversupplemented with nutrients Zoo Biol 29.517-525, 2010 (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc

AB  - Tortoise ecology is poorly studied in East Africa. Here, using two terrestrial Testudinidae (Stigmochelys pardalis and Kinbcys belliana) as study models, we (i) present basic demographic characteristics (sex-ratio, and density), (ii) describe correlates of their presence at two spatial scales (micro-habitat and macro-habitat), (iii) evaluate the effects of rainfall on their seasonal activity patterns, and (iv) analyze abundance patterns in relation to macro and micro-habitat characteristics. We also describe an experiment, using tortoise shells, that can allow to control, and eventually correct, the reliability of observed data by taking into account the detectability of the study species in the wild. On the basis of a suite of statistical analysis and GIS-based elaborations, we confirmed, and further uncovered, the remarkable ecological differences existing between S. pardalis and K. belliana. The habitat use was different interspecifically, with K. belliana being much more linked to dense vegetation spots, often nearby waterbodies, whereas S. pardalis being an habitat generalist, at both micro- and macmhabitat scale. Nonetheless, juveniles of both species were observed in areas with significantly higher % soil covered by vegetation taller than 200 cm than adults of both sexes. This different habitat selection is hypothesized to be due to antipredatory reasons. Overall, our data suggests that interspecific competition should be minimal between these species.

AB  - An adult Leopard tortoise (Geochelone pardalis pardalis) with severe clinical disease characterised by nasal discharge, severe necrotising stomatitis, dehydration, apathy and anorexia was presented at the Clinic for Avian, Reptile and Fish Medicine of the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna. Shortly before the onset of clinical symptoms the animal had been imported from Ethiopia. Specific PCRs for iridovirus and Chelonid herpesvirus (ChHV) gave positive results with pharyngeal swabs and necrotic layers of the oral cavity. The positive result could be confirmed by sequencing for iridovirus specific nucleic acids, the band achieved for ChHV was too weak for sequencing. Additionally various bacterial infections (Staphylococcus spp., Citrobacter freundii, E coli, Salmonella spp., coagulase negative Staphylococcus spp.) and mycosis (Candida spp.) were found, probably all secondary due to the virus induced epithelial damage. Sequence analysis of the detected iriclovirus revealed nucleotide identities of 98 to >99 % with various amphibian and reptilian isolates of the FV-3 group. After one month of intensive treatment the animal was released and recovered fully after 4 months. Our results show that an iriclovirus infection has to be considered as possible coagent or differential diagnosis to ChHV. This is, the first report of iridovirus infection in the species Geochelone pardalis pardalis.

AB  - The leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis) is among the most ubiquitously distributed chelonian species in Africa. As with other chelonians, however, the species' slow growth rate, coupled with low survivorship of juveniles, make it susceptible to declines under regimes of environmental perturbation. Here we studied the impact of electrified fences, a key source of mortality for many South African terrestrial vertebrate taxa, on leopard tortoise mortality in the Free State Province (Jacobsdal district) and Northern Cape Province (Strydenburg district), and its implications for survivorship of this population. Our results show a strong selection bias towards larger (breeding age) individuals that, given the life history of the species, should have strong (negative) consequences for populations. Using data for tortoise populations from other regions as a baseline for survivorship rates in populations unaffected by fencing, we derived a size-structure matrix model to evaluate the impact on population growth rates. Population projections, taking into account variation in survivorship and reproductive rates across and within size classes, indicated substantially higher risk of negative population growth (and eventual extinction) in populations affected by electrified fences. These results confirm that fencing is a conservation problem for the leopard tortoise population in this, and probably other regions, and highlights an urgent need for more intensive regulation of electrified fencing practices among landowners.

AB  - Historically, studies of reptilian thermal biology have compared ambient temperatures (T-a) to body temperatures (T-b) from the animal under study, with T-b usually taken from the cloaca and various instruments being used to measure T-b. The advent of surgically implanted miniature temperature loggers has offered the opportunity to test the efficacy of cloacal T-b as a measurement in thermoregulatory studies. We expected that there was a difference between skin, cloacal, and core T-b's. Temperatures were measured from various positions on leopard tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis) using thermocouples and miniature temperature loggers, including surgically implanted temperature loggers. Measurements of temperature from various positions on and in the tortoise were significantly different from T-a. Cloacal T-b's were significantly lower than all other body temperatures measured, and core T-b's were significantly different from cloacal T-b, skin and carapace temperatures. In addition, significant differences were found between measures of temperature from other parts of the body. The variations between core T-b, cloacal T-b and other measures of T-b indicated that there are large thermal gradients within the body of a relatively large tortoise at any given time with cloacal T-b not an accurate measure of core T-b.

AB  - Behavioral thermoregulation is used by tortoises (Family Testunidae) to moderate the effects of daily and seasonal fluctuations in ambient temperature on their body temperature. Extensive use is made of refuges to facilitate this behavioral thermoregulation. The Nama-Karoo in South Africa experiences wide temperature fluctuations both daily and seasonally. We investigated the seasonal use of refuges by the leopard tortoise (Geochelone pardalis) and the orientation of the tortoises with the refuges. Turtles used a wide variety of refuges, with Lycium spp. Eberlanzia ferox, Opuntica Ficus, and grass clumps being preferred. Seasonal variation in the use of refuges depeneded on whether the refuges were used as forms or shelters. Tortoises in spring and winter often remained in the same refuge for the entire season or returned to the same refuge on consecutive nights. We found seasonal and behavioral variation in (a) the orientation of the tortoises withing a refuge, and (b) the portion of the shell of each leopard tortoise within a refuge that was exposed to solar radiation. Tortoises in winter and spring maximised the amount of solar radiation received on their shells, while tortoises in summer and autumn minimized the solar radiation received. Consequently, using a combination of refuge type, and body orientation, leopard tortoises appear to passively thermoregulate and thus control for temperature fluctuations experienced in an extreme environment.

AB  - After a period of anorexia, a leopard tortoise (Geochelone pardalis), which had been housed under bad conditions, was force-fed with a blunted needle. Accidentally the animal had swallowed the needle. On radiographs taken immediately, the needle proved to be in the stomach. On gastroscopy 36 hours later the needle had already left the stomach into the duodenum. Consecutive X-rays showed the needle to proceed in the intestinal tract. After it stayed in the same place for 3 days, with the animal under general anesthesia the needle was removed with the aid of laparoscopic techniques. The incisions in the skin and the gut were closed according to general surgical procedures. Recovery was rapid. One month after surgery the animal started eating itself, and sometime later she even produced eggs, from which one healthy young tortoise hatched.

AB  - The diet and plant species preferences of two sympatric tortoises, the mountain tortoise Geochelone pardalis and serrated tortoise Psammobates oculifer, were studied in the northern Cape Province, South Africa. Owing to the difference in rainfall patterns during the two years of study, differing results were obtained between study periods and between tortoise species. During the dry year both tortoises used the vegetation in relation to its availability; grass was used extensively as were succulents. In the higher rainfall study period a greater variety of ephemerals was available. The mountain tortoise extended its use of available species but continued to use grass; this component disappeared completely from the diet of the serrated tortoise and they concentrated on herbs and succulents. Preference in both species is for succulents and species of the Fabaceae. Tribulus terrestris also featured in both diets in both periods. It is suggested that the patterns shown reflect the climatic affinities of the two species.

AB  - The preservation of spermatozoa is an important tool used in conservation programs to increase the genetic diversity of threatened and endangered species. Although routinely used to manage conservation programs for higher vertebrates, there have been limited attempts to establish reproductive assistance programs for tortoises. The purpose of this study was to develop a model for collecting and characterizing semen in Testudinidae. Semen was collected from 13/16 (81.2%, 95% CI: 62-100) adult male leopard tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis) via electroejaculation under propofol anesthesia. Semen samples were collected most frequently after the second series of electrostimulations (6/13, 46.1%), with fewer animals producing semen after the first (5/13, 38.5%) or third (2/13, 15.4%) electrostimulations. The average volume of a semen sample in the tortoises was 0.26 ml (standard deviation: 0.16, minimum-maximum: 0.1-0.6), the average spermatozoal concentration was 101.62 x 10(6)/ml, and the average motility at time of collection was 57.3%. A rapid decrease in motility was observed in refrigerated samples over 24 h resulting in a median motility of 0% at 24 h post-collection. The results of this study suggest that electroejaculation is a safe and efficient method for collecting semen from leopard tortoises.

AB  - Observations were made of growth rate and variation in colour pattern of the leopard tortoise (Geochelone pardalis babcocki) in northern Tanzania between October 1993 and June 1996. Growth rate differed significantly between tortoises, with immature animals (6.9 +/- 1.4 mm month(-1)) and females (5.7 +/- 1.3 mm month(-1)) exhibiting higher rates of growth than adult animals (2.9 +/- 0.8 mm month(-1)) and males (3.2 +/- 1.1 mm month(-1)), respectively. The faster growth rate in immature animals suggested that growth rate declined with age. The difference in growth rates between the sexes was ascribed to sexual dimorphism, adult females being larger and therefore growing faster than males.
   The carapacial colour pattern observed in the northern Tanzanian tortoises was generally similar to that described elsewhere in the species' range. The colour pattern varied between Arusha and Serengeti District tortoises. Animals at the Arusha sites tended to be sparsely coloured (55.6%) compared to the Serengeti tortoises, which had a buff colouration with radiating spots (89.3%).; The sparse colouration provides effective camouflage in the drier Arusha habitats, as does the buff colouration with black spots in the wetter, darker habitats in the Serengeti.

AB  - Sub-Saharan Africa harbours an outstanding diversity of tortoises of which the leopard tortoise Stigmochelys pardalis is the most widespread. Across its' range the species is impacted by habitat transformation, over-collection for human consumption and the pet trade, road mortality, and electrocution by electric fences. Most leopard tortoises in southern Africa are nowadays restricted to reserves and private farms. So far confiscated tortoises are frequently released into a nearby reserve without knowledge on their area of origin. This is problematic, as it has been demonstrated that the leopard tortoise harbours five distinct mitochondrial lineages, of which three occur in the southern portion of the species' distributional range (South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana). Using 14 microsatellite loci corresponding to 270 samples collected throughout southern Africa, we found a clear substructuring in the north constituting four clusters (western, central, north-eastern, and eastern). Genetic diversity was particularly high in the north-east and decreased towards the south. In addition, we found a significant size difference between the studied populations. Our basic morphological analysis showed that tortoises from the southern cluster tend to grow bigger than tortoises from the north. We established a comprehensive genetic database for South Africa and Namibia that can serve as a conservation management tool for the assignment and potential release of translocated or seized leopard tortoises based on genetic affiliation.

KW  - SEASONAL MOVEMENTS
AB  - Seasonal shifts and overlap in home range are poorly known in the Leopard Tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis). Consequently, these, together with daily distance moved, were investigated in the semiarid Narna-Karoo, as a function of season, sex, and body mass. Annual home-range size was significantly greater for telemetered compared with nontelemetered tortoises stressing the importance of telemetry in spatial ecological studies of tortoises. Consequently, only telemetered tortoises were analyzed further in terms of variation between seasons and sexes. Home ranges differed significantly with season and were smallest in winter, when tortoises were less active. Seasonal home-range size did not differ between sexes. Considerable individual variation existed in the amount of home-range overlap both within and between sexes. Daily distance moved in each season was highly variable for each individual and between individuals. However, the least movement occurred in winter in all individuals. Home-range size and daily distances moved in the active seasons were larger than for Leopard Tortoises found in more mesic habitats, suggesting a resource availability effect. Increased home-range size, in conjunction with their low density and population size, has implications for Leopard Tortoise conservation in semiarid regions in terms of planning and designating conservation areas. Variation in home-range size with regard to habitat type must be considered when planning terrestrial tortoise conservation efforts.

AB  - Fifty-two tortoises, comprising 50 leopard tortoises Geochelone pardalis, one angulate tortoise Chersina angulata and one marsh terrapin Pelomedusa subrufa were found dead along 8,4 km of electrified fences in the Thomas Baines Nature Reserve, eastern Cape Province. Sixteen of these mortalities occurred during a 132-day  study period. Assuming reduced tortoise activity in winter, a conservative mortality rate of about 30 tortoises per year is estimated along the electrified fence in the reserve. Using regression curves based on detailed measurements of 109 leopard tortoises, the total length and shell height of 42 of the electrocuted animals  were calculated from their plastron lengths. Most tortoises (93%) killed were young adults (200-400 mm   total length). The height of the electrified wire measured at the point of electrocution of 30 dead tortoises was, with one exception, less than 200 mm above ground level. To reduce tortoise mortality in the reserve it is recommended that the electrified wire height be maintained at at least 250 mm above ground level, and that the fences be powered only at night.

AB  - We investigated bone mineral density values of the shell (carapace and plastron) of a modern leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys purdahs Bell, 1828) to assess its impact on survivorship of the different skeletal elements. We found significant differences among elements for bone mineral density and density volume, but not for bone mineral content.
   We then compared these findings with those obtained using computed tomography (CT) scans of shells of three modern tortoise species that differ in size and shape; the leopard tortoise, greater padloper (Homopus femoralis) and angulate tortoise (Chersina angulata). Results indicate that the patterning of bone density is similar across shell elements and scan sites in all species, although all values were lower in the greater padloper, which we attributed to shape differences - a flat rather than domed shell.
   Finally, we correlated the frequency of shell elements from the Holocene leopard tortoises recovered at the site of Wonderwerk Cave (South Africa) using, as a proxy, the densitometry values obtained from the modern leopard tortoise. For most strata there was a significant association with skeletal element survivorship demonstrating the role played by bone mineral density in determining the skeletal composition of this assemblage.

AB  - In this study we present data on bone mineral density (BMD) values for the cranial and post-cranial skeleton of the leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis). We found significant inter and intra-skeletal variation in different values of BMD within this species. The intra-skeletal, but not inter-skeletal pattern, was comparable to that of terrestrial mammals of similar size, despite differences in bone structure. Overall, the tortoise has bone density that is intermediate between that of leporids (rabbits/hares) on the one hand and canids (dogs/wolves etc.) and marmots on the other. In this study we have used random effects to test regression models of BMD and demonstrate their value over the simple linear regression models that are currently in use.
   Finally, we applied the modern leopard tortoise proxy data to test whether different parameters of BMD impact survivorship of tortoise bones in the Holocene strata from Wonderwerk Cave (Northern Cape Province, South Africa). Results indicate that this assemblage has undergone some degree of bone density-mediated attrition, probably influenced by burning and deposition time rather than animal agents.

AB  - Leopard tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis) experience wide fluctuations in environmental conditions and unpredictable availability of food and water within the Nama-Karoo biome. It was hypothesised that tortoises fed two diets differing in preformed water and fibre content would have differing food intake, gut transit rate, assimilation efficiency, faecal and urinary water loss, and urine concentrations. It was predicted that tortoises fed these contrasting diets would attempt to maintain energy and water balance by altering their digestive parameters. Leopard tortoises fed lucerne (Medicago sativa) had a low food intake coupled with long gut transit times, which resulted in the lowest amount of faecal energy and faecal water lost. Tortoises fed tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) had higher food intake and faster gut transit times, but more energy and water was lost in the faeces. However, daily energy assimilated and assimilation efficiency were comparable between tortoises fed the two diets. Urine osmolality was significantly different between tortoises on the two diets. Results indicate that leopard tortoises can adjust parameters such as transit rate, food intake, water loss and urine osmolality to maintain body mass, water and energy balance in response to a high fibre, low water content and a low fibre, high water content diet. This study suggests that this digestive flexibility allows leopard tortoises in the wild to take advantage of unpredictable food and water resources. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Little published information has been available on the ecology and conservation of Leopard Tortoises (Stignachelys pardalis) in Ethiopia. In this study, we undertook field surveys of tortoises at seven sites over 3 y (2015-2017) to provide a rough estimate of population density of the species. In addition, in 2019, we interviewed managers of wildlife protected areas in Ethiopia to explore the conservation and management status, population abundance, and threats facing the species in the country. We estimated mean density of Leopard Tortoises at 0.0343 +/- 0.0048 (standard error) individuals per ha across all sites. We also confirmed that Leopard Tortoises occur in at least half of protected areas of the country. The majority of protected area managers reported their perception of the present population abundance of the species to be common and the population trend in the last 10 y to have been stable. While managers reported their response of the current population status of the species with relatively high certainty levels, they reported trends in abundance with relatively low certainty. Although managers perceived that trends in overall threats facing the species had been stable in the last 10 y, they reported this with low level of certainty. They also indicated, however, with high certainty, that current Leopard Tortoise hunting was occurring at an unprecedented rate. These findings may suggest that managers are more certain about current situations than about trends. In conclusion, our results provide basic information to aid management decisions and encourage future research.

AB  - The Leopard Tortoise (Geochelone pardalis) is the largest of the southern African species and has a wide distribution encompassing a variety of habitats. There is a paucity of ecological information about Leopard Tortoises in these habitats. The goal of this study was to determine the population density, biomass, sex and age distributions, and morphometrics of Leopard Tortoises on farmland in the semi-arid Nama-Karoo. Because previous studies have found that body size distributions vary between mesic and xeric habitats, we expected that these Leopard Tortoises would show an increased body size compared to those from more mesic areas. In addition, we expected lower densities of Leopard Tortoises compared to more mesic areas. In total, 92 tortoises were caught with a male to female sex ratio of 1:1.3 that was not significantly different from unity. Adult females were significantly larger than males with respect to all morphometric measurements. Leopard Tortoises (excluding juveniles) were larger than those from more mesic areas. A population estimate of 57.6 +/- 4.0 tortoises in a 5500 ha area was obtained using a mark-recapture sampling method and radio-telemetry. Density of tortoises was extremely low at 0.017 tortoises ha(-1), with a biomass of 0.002 kg ha(-1). Population density and biomass were lower compared with Leopard Tortoise populations in more mesic areas. This has implications for the understanding of fitness parameters and conservation of this species in semiarid areas.

AB  - Babcock's leopard tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis babcocki) are taken to rehabilitation centers in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa, because they are either escaped, unwanted, or confiscated pets, or else are confiscated from persons who acquire them illegally from the wild. South African rehabilitation centers are reluctant to euthanize tortoises, and there are few tortoise sanctuaries. Consequently, the local conservation authority, Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife, developed a release protocol based on International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources guidelines, to facilitate the release of rehabilitated S. p. babcocki into the wild. The present study was done to determine whether rehabilitated animals could be successfully released into the wild, judged by whether individuals were able to survive in the wild. Seventeen apparently healthy individuals, with longer than 100-mm carapace length, that had been in captivity for more than 2 months in a large rehabilitation center were released into the wild. These rehabilitated animals, with attached radiotelemeters, were hard-released at 2 different sites within the historical range of the species and were monitored over a year. One of the tortoises was returned to captivity because of disease, 3 were killed intentionally or accidentally by humans, one died probably due to being turned over by another animal, 3 others died from a combination of disease, starvation and/or dehydration, and the fate of 6 was unknown. Because only 2 animals survived 13 months after release at one of the sites and only one was known to have survived 25 months after release at the other site, rehabilitated S. p. babcocki were not successfully released into the wild. However, recommendations to improve the probability of success of future releases of rehabilitated S. p. babcocki into the wild are provided.

AB  - Whilst tracking is used globally, impact studies on wildlife are limited. The semi-arid Karoo, South Africa, a large ecosystem with a high degree of endemism, is targeted for fracking. We investigated how adult leopard tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis) use their environment by determining individual and seasonal variation in home range and effects of weather factors on these pre-fracking. Data were obtained from Global Positioning System (GPS) transmitters placed on leopard tortoises (n = 11) on private livestock farms near Beaufort West, South Africa for a year. Kernel density estimation (KDE) was used to estimate home range. Individuals had a mean (+/- SE) home range of 121.86 +/- 28.12 ha, (range 40.53-258.52 ha) with a core area of 76.55 +/- 17.33 ha (range 21.22-83.89 ha). No difference was found between annual male and female home ranges. Two telemetered individuals were excluded from analysis because they exhibited apparent nomadic behaviour. Several individuals did not visit permanent water sources, possibly suggesting that dietary water intake was sufficient. Generalised Linear Mixed Models were used to explain monthly home range estimates (95% KDEhref) in regards to biologically significant predictor variables. A single top model (Delta AIC(c) < 2) was produced, indicating importance of individual variability (sex, body mass) and weather (temperature, rainfall) variables. Our results provide baseline data pre-fracking in the region, and as such, should be repeated following commencement of fracking. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In contrast to mammals, little is known about the phylogeographic structuring of widely distributed African reptile species. With the present study, we contribute data for the leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis). It ranges from the Horn of Africa southward to South Africa and westwards to southern Angola. However, its natural occurrence is disputed for some southern regions. To clarify the situation, we used mtDNA sequences and 14 microsatellite loci from 204 individuals mainly from southern Africa. Our results retrieved five mitochondrial clades; one in the south and two in the north-west and north-east of southern Africa, respectively, plus two distributed further north. Using microsatellites, the southern clade matched with a well-defined southern nuclear cluster, whilst the two northern clades from southern Africa corresponded to another nuclear cluster with three subclusters. One subcluster had a western and central distribution, another occurred mostly in the north-east, and the third in a small eastern region (Maputaland), which forms part of a biodiversity hotspot. Genetic diversity was low in the south and high in the north of our study region, particularly in the north-east. Our results refuted that translocations influenced the genetic structure of leopard tortoises substantially. We propose that Pleistocene climatic fluctuations caused leopard tortoises to retract to distinct refugia in southern and northern regions and ascribe the high genetic diversity in the north of southern Africa to genetic structuring caused by the survival in three refuges and subsequent admixture, whereas tortoises in the south seem to have survived in only one continuous coastal refuge.

AB  - The leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis) is the most widely distributed sub-Saharan tortoise species, with a range extending from the Horn of Africa all over eastern Africa to the Republic of South Africa, Namibia and southernmost Angola. Using 1938 bp of mitochondrial DNA (cyt b gene, partial ND4 gene plus adjacent tRNA genes) from a nearly range-wide sampling, we examined its phylogeographic structure and compared our findings with previously published GenBank sequences. We identified seven major clades that are largely parapatrically distributed. A few records of distinct haplotypes at the same locality or in close proximity could be the result of translocation of tortoises by man. The greatest diversity occurs in the south of the species' range, with five out of the seven clades. Testing for isolation-by-distance suggests that the observed phylogeographic structure is the result of restricted geographical gene flow and not of historical vicariance. This is in sharp contrast to wide-ranging thermophilic reptiles from the western Palaearctic, whose phylogeographic structure was significantly shaped by Pleistocene range interruptions, but also by earlier dispersal and vicariant events. Most cyt b sequences of S. pardalis from GenBank turned out to be nuclear pseudogenes, or to be of chimerical origin from such pseudogenes and authentic mitochondrial sequences, which argues for caution regarding uncritical usage of GenBank sequences. The recent revalidation of the two subspecies of S. pardalis was based on such a chimerical sequence that was erroneously identified with the subspecies S. p. babcocki. Furthermore, according to our data, the distribution of mitochondrial clades does match neither the traditional subspecies ranges nor the pronounced geographical size variation of leopard tortoises. We conclude that there is no rationale for recognizing subspecies within S. pardalis.

AB  - Seasonal habitat utilization, refugia selection, and sheltering behavior by the leopard tortoise (Geochelone pardalis) was investigated over a 24-month period (September 1990-September 1992) in the Franklin Nature Reserve, South Africa. The study area was located on Naval Hill, a dolerite and shale mesa which provided diverse topographical and vegetation aspects from which the tortoises could select habitats and refugia. Results showed that considerable shifts occurred in habitat and shelter selection between summer days, summer nights, and winter, with tortoises predominantly utilizing the plateau area. This was ascribed to the availability of shelter, exposure to solar radiation, accessibility, food resources, and the presence of water. Shelters were selected to meet specific needs governed by environmental conditions at the time, with 64.6% of shelters being exclusively utilized within one of the three periods monitored. Thirty-three plant species were utilized as shelters. Tortoises selected dense shelter cover during summer days, light shelter cover or none at all for summer nights, and light shelter cover for winter. Of the latter category, 67.4% of tortoises selected < 50% cover. Day and night shelter orientation was completely random in summer. The orientation of winter shelters was predominantly westerly with light cover shelters, and within which 67.4% of tortoises remained throughout winter. Under the cold conditions encountered on Naval Hill this appeared to be the best-suited survival strategy and provided the best conditions for tortoises to build up and retain sufficient heat during the day in order for them to maintain a temperature above that of ambient through most of the night.

AB  - The greater padloper, Homopus femoralis, is largely endemic to South Africa. Its ecology remains unstudied, yet the efficient planning of field research is complicated by lack of data on its activity patterns. I studied a population in spring, summer and autumn 2008-2011, and found that H. femoralis was active (i.e. basking, drinking, feeding or walking) only during brief intervals following rainfall or imminent rain, perhaps to avoid avian predators or physiological costs of water and food shortages. Future studies might locate active tortoises in the highest rainfall months, and use telemetry to identify activity patterns throughout the year.

AB  - Fencing, including electric fencing, is widely used across South Africa for livestock and game ranching practices. Leopard tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis) are particularly prone to being killed by electric fences, but no published studies have assessed the impact of fence structure or quantified tortoise mortality along non-electric fences. This is a conservation concern, especially because South Africa is home to more tortoise species than any other country. This study relates tortoise mortality associated with electrified and non-electrified fences to fence structure, and uses transects away from fences as a comparison to estimate the impact of fences on mortality. All fence types had significantly higher tortoise mortality than open veld transects. Leopard tortoise mortalities were greatest along electric fences (56 % of mortalities), even though these comprised only 4% of fences in the study. By comparison, most angulate tortoises (Chersina angulata) died after becoming wedged in mesh fences. The distribution and abundance of fence types along 2200 km of roads was used to extrapolate the impacts of different fence types on tortoises in the southeastern Karoo, South Africa. A survey of land-use types indicated that game farms were more likely to be associated with the presence of electric fences. Regulations are needed to limit mortality of vulnerable species (tortoises, pangolins) on electric fences by setting a minimum strand height and 'escape' periods implemented through randomized off times or thermostatic switches.

AB  - Background: Tortoises (Testudinidae) occur in a wide range of environments, providing important ecosystem functions, such as seed dispersal and refuge in the form of burrows. Tortoise movement has previously been shown to be related to resource availability, reproductive status and local environmental conditions. However, understanding of the variables that drive their movement remains comparatively low. We investigated aspects of movement in leopard tortoises Stigmochelys pardalis-the largest and most abundant tortoise species in sub-Saharan Africa-in response to environmental, climatic and individual variables in the semi-arid Karoo, South Africa. We used GPS telemetry to calculate bihourly and daily movement and used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to ascertain important predictor variables.
   Results: Temperature, distance from water sources, and month were important variables for predicting both bihourly and daily movement. Our results showed that movement increased when individuals were close to known water sources, indicating that individuals close to water resources make regular long distance movements. Movement showed a positive relationship for temperature in both models, whilst rainfall was an important predictor for bihourly movement. Our results displayed aspects of seasonality, with movement highest in spring months, likely related to reproductive activities, although no sex differences were observed.
   Conclusions: We identified temporal and spatial conditions in which leopard tortoise movement increased. Our results further support the relationship between water as a resource and movement in leopard tortoises. Individuals used one of two basic movement behaviours in relation to water in this water scarce environment. Either an individual's home range and movements included permanent water resources allowing internal water storage replenishment, or excluded these with reliance on food resources (such as grasses, forbs, and succulents) for water.

AB  - A total of 586 reptiles, belonging to 35 species and five subspecies, were examined in surveys aimed at determining the species spectrum and geographic distribution of ticks that infest them. Of these reptiles 509 were tortoises, 28 monitor or other lizards, and 49 snakes. Nine ixodid tick species, of which seven belonged to the genus Amblyomma, and one argasid tick, Ornithodoros compactus were recovered. Seven of the ten tick species are parasites of reptiles. Amongst these seven species Amblyomma marmoreum was most prevalent and numerous on leopard tortoises, Geochelone pardalis; Amblyomma nuttalli was present only on Bell's hinged tortoises, Kinixys belliana; and most Amblyomma sylvaticum were collected from angulate tortoises, Chersina angulata. Amblyomma exornatum (formerly Aponomma exornatum) was only recovered from monitor lizards, Varanus spp.; most Amblyomma latum (formerly Aponomma latum) were from snakes; and a single nymph of Amblyomma transversale (formerly Aponomma transversale) was collected from a southern African python, Python natalensis. All 30 Namaqualand speckled padloper tortoises, Homopus signatus signatus, examined were infested with O. compactus.
   The seasonal occurrence of A. sylvaticum and the geographic distribution of this tick and of A. marmoreum, A. nuttalli, A. exornatum, A. latum and O. compactus, are illustrated.

AB  - Preference testing has long been used in ethology and animal welfare science to assess the preferences that animals have for different resources and stimuli. The study conducted herein assessed the choice-making ability of five leopard tortoises Stigmochelys pardalis in a novel two-phase preference test. Phase 1 was a discrete choice test in a y-maze with two options: food in one arm, the other arm left empty, with positions fixed per tortoise, but randomised across tortoises. Multivariate ANOVA were performed on three dependent variables of time taken to make a choice in both phases. In Phase 1, four of the five tortoises clearly chose the food arm more than the empty arm. One tortoise chose the food arm and empty arm equally (50/50). Phase 2 involved opening an additional arm on the maze and offering each tortoise three choices: food (the same as Phase 1); human interaction (shell scratches and rubs using hands); or an empty arm. Positions were again fixed per tortoise but randomised across tortoises. In Phase 2, tortoise choices were more varied. Two tortoises chose human interaction more than the other two maze arms; another two chose the food maze arm most; and one did not seem to show a strong preference for any particular arm. These results suggested that some individuals of this species of tortoise may possibly prefer this form of human interaction (shell scratches and rubs) over other stimuli in certain conditions; however, further research is necessary to improve the confidence of the conclusions presented herein.

AB  - The objective of the study was to record the tick species collected from three species of tortoise, each in a different province of South Africa. Ticks were collected from leopard tortoises, Stigmochyles pardalis, in the southern region of the Kruger National Park, Mpumalanga province; from hingeback tortoises, Kinixys zombensis, in the Enseleni Nature Reserve, KwaZulu-Natal province and from angulate tortoises, Chersina angulata, in the West Coast National Park, Western Cape province. Of the 63 leopard tortoises examined, 58 were infested with Amblyomma marmoreum and 49 with Amblyomma hebraeum, and all stages of development of both species were recovered. Amblyomma nuttalli was collected from 25 hingeback tortoises, and all stages of development were present. All 24 angulate tortoises examined were infested with Amblyomma sylvaticum, and large numbers of larvae, nymphs and adults were collected. Three snake species and a sand lizard were also infested with A. sylvaticum. The adults of A. marmoreum, A. nuttalli and A. sylvaticum were identified as specific parasites of the family Testudinidae, whereas all stages of development of A. hebraeum were classified as generalists.

AB  - Significant increases in serum globulins (alpha(1), alpha(2), beta and gamma) were observed in mountain leopard tortoises (Geochelone pardalis) after they had been Immunized with nymphal homogenates of Amblyomma marmoreum. There was a concomitant significant increase in the numbers of leukocytes (lymphocytes, basophils, monocytes and eosinophils).
   Resistance to nymphal-challenge infestations was manifested by reduced feeding time, lower engorgement masses, and significantly fewer (P < 0,0001) numbers of nymphs that moulted.
   These findings are contrary to the generally reported phenomenon, that ticks do not induce resistance in their natural hosts.

AB  - The tortoise tick Amblyomma marmoreum Koch was found to be established on a reptile facility in central Florida. Over a 5-mo period, 443 ticks were collected from tortoises, dogs, and vegetation. Collections from hosts were primarily from 3 species of exotic tortoises, including leopard tortoises, Aldabra tortoises, and yellow-footed tortoises. The total numbers of ticks present, the presence of all life stages, and the slow development of this species indicate that this is not a recent infestation. The source of the infestation is unknown because no tortoises were imported or moved onto this premise within the previous year. The propensity of this tick to feed on mammals and reptiles as immatures, its status as an experimental heartwater vector, and potential for further accidental introductions to the United States elicit concern toward the more widespread establishment of this species.

AB  - Herpesviruses are found in free-living and captive chelonian populations, often in association with morbidity and mortality. To date, all known chelonian herpesviruses fall within the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae. We detected a novel herpesvirus in 3 species of chelonians: a captive leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis) in western TX, USA; a steppe tortoise (Testudo [Agrionemys] horsfieldii) found near Fort Irwin, CA, USA; and 2 free-living, three-toed box turtles (Terrapene mexicana triunguis) found in Forest Park, St. Louis, MO. The leopard tortoise was coinfected with the tortoise intranuclear coccidian and had clinical signs of upper respiratory tract disease. The steppe tortoise had mucopurulent nasal discharge and lethargy. One of the three-toed box turtles had no clinical signs; the other was found dead with signs of trauma after being observed with blepharedema, tympanic membrane swelling, cervical edema, and other clinical signs several weeks prior to death. Generally, the branching order of the turtle herpesviruses mirrors the divergence patterns of their hosts, consistent with codivergence. Based on phylogenetic analysis, this novel herpesvirus clusters with a clade of viruses that infect emydid hosts and is likely of box turtle origin. Therefore, we suggest the name terrapene alphaherpesvirus 3 (TerAHV3) for the novel virus. This virus also has the ability to host-jump to tortoises, and previously documented herpesviral morbidity tends to be more common in aberrant hosts. The relationship between clinical signs and infection with TerAHV3 in these animals is unclear, and further investigation is merited.

KW  - INTRANUCLEAR COCCIDIOSIS
AB  - More than 30 species of coccidian parasites have been described in Chelonidae (tortoises and turtles). Eimeria spp. are apparently the most common coccidia in chelonians. Findings of Caryospora cheloniae, Isospora sp., and Mantonella sp. have also been published, but reports about systemic coccidiosis are rare. We describe a case of a coccidiosis diagnosed cytologically in a radiated tortoise (Geochelone radiata) which was captive-bred in Germany. Infection was systemic and involved the lymphoid system. Intracytoplasmatic stages of parasite development were identified cytologically, histologically, and ultrastructurally. The systemic coccidiosis was associated with variable degrees of inflammation in the different organs and contributed substantially to the cause of death in this tortoise. Fragments of coccidian 18S- and 28S-rRNA from the tortoise liver were sequenced; the 18S-rRNA sequence had the highest identity to intranuclear coccidia described previously in a travancore tortoise (Intestudo forstenii) and a leopard tortoise (Geochelone pardalis). The analysis of maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree showed relation to species of the order Sarcocystidae. The biology of these coccidia and the route of infection in this case remained unclear.

AB  - Intranuclear coccidiosis of itestudines (known as TINC) is an emerging disease in chelonians. Although endogenous stages were repeatedly detected in various tissues, attempts to find the oocysts in faeces failed, leaving the question of the transmission and classification of the causative agent of TINC unresolved. We recorded small spherical oocysts (similar to 6-7 mu m in diameter) of an eimeriid coccidium in faeces of a leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis). Sporulated oocysts were used for the experimental oral inoculation of juvenile coccidia-free tortoises representing 5 species (S. pardalis, Testudo graeca, T. hermanni, T. horsfieldii, and Geochelone sulcata). The oocysts' association with TINC was confirmed based on clinical signs, histopathological findings of intranuclear endogenous stages of the coccidium in many organs (including intestine), and by the partial 18S rDNA sequence analysis of the DNA isolated from organs of the experimentally infected animals and from a single naturally infected as well as from all experimentally infected tortoises. Breeding colonies of chelonians should be screened for this pathogen in order to prevent its further spread and unwanted introduction into endangered free-ranging chelonian populations.

AB  - The tortoise tick Amblyomma marmoreum was collected from large numbers of reptiles and other animals during the course of numerous surveys conducted in South Africa. A total of 1229 ticks, of which 550 were adults, were recovered from 309 reptiles belonging to 13 species, with leopard tortoises, Geochelone pardalis being the most heavily infested. The 269 birds sampled harboured 4901 larvae, 217 nymphs and no adult ticks, and the prevalence of infestation was greatest on helmeted guineafowls, Numida meleagris. Only two larvae were recovered from 610 rodents, including 31 spring hares, Pedetes capensis, whereas 1144 other small mammals yielded 1835 immature ticks, of which 1655 were collected from 623 scrub hares, Lepus saxatilis. The 213 carnivores examined harboured 2459 ticks of which none were adult. A single adult tick and 6684 larvae and 62 nymphs were recovered from 656 large herbivores, and a total of 4081 immature ticks and three adults were collected from 1543 domestic animals and 194 humans.
   Adult male and female A. marmoreum were most numerous on reptiles during January and February, and larvae during March. The largest numbers of larvae were present on domestic cattle and helmeted guineafowls in the Eastern Cape Province during March or April respectively, whereas larvae were most numerous on helmeted guineafowls, scrub hares and the vegetation in north-eastern Mpumalanga Province during May. In both provinces nymphs were most numerous between October and December. Amblyomma marmoreum appears to be most prevalent in the western regions of the Western and Eastern Cape and Free State provinces, and the north-eastern regions of the Northern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumulanga and Limpopo provinces.

AB  - Testudines are a group of reptiles characterized by the presence of a shell covered by keratinous shields. Stigmochelys pardalis is the most widely distributed terrestrial testudine in southern Africa. Although relatively common with some life history traits being well known, the growth of this species has yet to be studied in any detail. The bone microanatomy of this clade differs from that found in other amniotes, where terrestrial species tend to display characteristics normally seen in aquatic species and vice versa. A detailed histological analysis of the limb bones of S. pardalis reveals extensive variation through ontogeny. Cortical bone becomes increasingly thicker through ontogeny and is finally resorbed in the late sub-adult stage, resulting in a thin cortex and a large infilled medullary cavity. The predominant bone tissues are parallel-fibred and lamellar-zonal for the forelimbs and hind limbs respectively. The oldest individual displayed an External Fundamental System indicating that the growth rate had decreased substantially by this stage. Variability is prevalent between the forelimb and hind limb as well as between early and late sub-adults Forelimb elements exhibit characteristics such as faster growing parallel-fibered bone tissue, slightly higher vascularization and a predominance of annuli over Lines of Arrested Growth (LAG) compared to the hind limb which exhibits poorly vascularized, slower growing lamellar-zonal bone interrupted by LAGs. These differences indicate that the forelimb grew more rapidly than the hind limb, possibly due to the method of locomotion seen in terrestrial species. The extensive bone resorption that occurs from the early sub-adult stage destroys much of the primary cortex and results in a significantly different ratio of inner and outer bone diameter (p = 3.59 x 10(-5); df = 28.04) as well as compactness (p = 2.91 x 10(-5); df = 31.27) between early and late sub-adults. The extensive bone resorption seen also destroys the ecological signal and infers an aquatic lifestyle for this species despite it being clearly terrestrial. This supports the results of other studies that have found that using bone microanatomy to determine lifestyle in testudines does not produce accurate results.

AB  - Energy metabolism varies considerably between different groups of endotherms, yet there is little or no reported variation among extant groups of reptiles. We measured lower resting metabolic rates (RMRs) in Kalahari tent tortoises (Psammobate oculiferus) than in sympatric Leopard tortoises (Geochelone pardalis). G pardalis also had RMR values that were higher than the allometric prediction for reptiles whereas P oculiferus had RMR values that were not significantly different from the prediction. Differences in RMR between the two species may have occurred because of the large differences in body mass, differing body temperatures, differences in growth rates, or because there may have been differences in the heat increment of feeding.

TI  - HABITAT ASSOCIATION OF THE TORTOISES GEOCHELONE PARDALIS AND KINIXYS SPEKII IN THE SENGWA-WILDLIFE-RESEARCH-AREA, ZIMBABWE
T2  - HERPETOLOGICAL JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - There have been few studies of the mechanism of niche separation in sympatric tortoises. This paper examines the habitat association of Geochelone pardalis and Kinixys spekii at the Sengwa Wildlife Research Area, using data on 460 tortoises marked from 1982 to 1992. Tortoises were found in most of the vegetation types present. Habitat niche breadth was slightly greater in G, pardalis (B=0.48) than in K. spekii (B=0.36). There was considerable niche overlap between the two species (O=0.76), the only major difference being the greater use of riverine grassland by G. pardalis. Home range areas of individuals recaptured in several years were significantly larger in G. pardalis (mean 26 ha) than in K. spekii (mean 3.1 ha). The pattern of refuge use differed between the two species; K. spekii used burrows, and G. pardalis used thickets and felled trees.

AB  - Growth rings were measured in dead African leopard tortoises, Geochelone pardalis, collected in the seasonal tropics of Zimbabwe over an 11-year period. A series of Ford-Walford plots using growth measured from annuli showed that growth fitted a logistic by mass curve best, logistic by length and Gompertz curves less well, and a Bertalanffy curve least well. The Bertalanffy curve, often fitted to growth of chelonians, is characterised by particularly high growth rates of juveniles compared with larger individuals. It is suggested that this growth pattern is likely to be found in species showing a marked decrease in diet quality with size. This hypothesis is supported by a review of growth patterns in chelonians: Bertalanffy curves are associated with an omnivorous (and thus potentially variable) diet and other growth patterns with an obligate carnivorous or herbivorous diet. Geochelone pardalis in Zimbabwe showed significant sexual size dimorphism, the mean asymptotic mass of females being 1.7 times that of males, unlike populations with larger body sizes to the north and south. Annual survival estimated from age-frequency distributions was significantly higher in males (0.80) than in females (0.72), the difference being sufficient to account for the male-biased sex ratio of live animals.

AB  - Experimental infection trials were conducted to investigate susceptibility of leopard tortoises (Geochelone pardalis) and helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris) to infection with Cowdria ruminantium, the causative agent of heartwater, a tickborne disease of domestic and wild ruminants. Ten guineafowl were inoculated intravenously with a virulent dose of C. ruminantium derived from bovine endothelial cell cultures, and four leopard tortoises were exposed to C. ruminantium infection by the feeding of infected Amblyomma hebraeum ticks. Uninfected A. hebraeum ticks ton both tortoises and guineafowl) and Amblyomma marmoreum ticks ton tortoises only) were fed on the animals during weeks 2 and 3 post-exposure in an attempt to detect infection. These ticks were analyzed for C. ruminantium infection by xenodiagnosis and with the C. ruminantium-specific pCS20 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Attempts to detect infection in ticks fed on either species were negative by both tests. These results suggest that leopard tortoises and helmeted guineafowl are refractory to C. ruminantium infection and, therefore, are unlikely to be capable of introducing heartwater directly into new areas. However, leopard tortoises are efficient hosts of A. marmoreum and A. hebraeum and are like ly to be important epidemiologically in the transport and maintenance of these tick vector species.

AB  - Carapacial suite pyramiding (CSP) is common in captive-raised turtles and tortoises. Several dietary and environmental hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, but few have been scientifically investigated. The effect of increased heat exposure on CSP and growth was examined in juvenile African leopard (Stigmochelys pardalis) and spurred (Centrochelys sulcata) tortoises. Monthly measurements of individual tortoise surface temperature, length, height, width, weight, and pyramid height of treatment (heat) and control (no heat) groups for 2 years were higher in the treatment groups. Allometric comparison further revealed increased pyramiding in the treatment group. Humidity and diet did not differ between treatment and control groups. The results of this research investigation indicate that growth rate and CSP appear to be directly related and both increase with excess nocturnal heat. The significance of the atypical carapace growth and subsequent consequences for naturally occurring tortoise populations, especially in the context of global climate change, is unknown but requires further investigation.

AB  - To date, four intraerythrocytic apicomplexans, namely the haemogregarines Haemogregarina fitzsimonsi and Haemogregarina parvula, and the haemoproteids Haemoproteus testudinalis and Haemoproteus natalensis, have been described from South African land tortoises. Recently, an intraleucocytic haemogregarine was observed in one species of tortoise, Stigmochelys pardalis, from the province of KwaZulu-Natal. Gamonts were identified in the monocytes and lymphocytes of 5/126 (4%) S. pardalis, but no additional stages were detected. Mixed infections with H. fitzsimonsi were observed for 2/5 (40%) of the parasitized S. pardalis, but the intraleucocytic gamont stages were larger than the intraerythrocytic gamont stages of both H. fitzsimonsi and H. parvula. The only other record of a chelonian intraleucocytic haemogregarine is of Haemogregarina pseudemydis, with stages described from the red and white blood cells of neotropical terrapins. Thus, the report of an intraleucocytic haemogregarine infecting a terrestrial tortoise from Africa is significant, although its taxonomic placement remains problematic at present.

AB  - We tested samples from 1,015 chelonians in Europe for Mycoplasma spp., herpesviruses, ranaviruses, picornaviruses, and ferlaviruses by PCR. Mycoplasma spp. were detected in 42.1% and herpesviruses were detected in 8.0% of tested chelonians. Differentiation of the herpesviruses revealed that 46.9% of the detected chelonian viruses were testudinid herpesvirus 1 (TeHV-1) and 54.3% were TeHV-3, including co-detections of TeHV-1 and -3 in 3 tortoises. TeHV-4 was detected in a leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis), and a herpesvirus that could not be further characterized was found in a pond slider (Trachemys scripta). Picornaviruses (topiviruses) were detected in 2.2% of the tested animals; ferlaviruses were found in 0.6%; no ranaviruses were detected in any of the animals tested. Mycoplasma spp. were detected significantly more often in Horsfield's tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii), leopard tortoises, and Indian star tortoises (Geochelone elegans) than in other species. Horsfield's tortoises were also significantly more often positive for TeHV-1. Mycoplasma and TeHV-1 were co-detected in 3.0%, and mycoplasma and TeHV-3 in 2.3%. The TeHV-4-positive tortoise was also positive for mycoplasma. Mycoplasma and picornaviruses were co-detected in 1.2% of the tortoises. A spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) was positive for mycoplasma and a ferlavirus. In some cases, >2 pathogens were detected. A significant correlation between mycoplasma and herpesvirus detection was found. Of all tested animals, 47.6% were positive for at least one pathogen, demonstrating the importance of pathogen detection in captive chelonians.

AB  - Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) is an arbovirus with a multisegmented genome related to those of unsegmented flaviviruses. The virus first described in Rhipicephalus microplus ticks collected in Jingmen city (Hubei Province, China) in 2010 is associated with febrile illness in humans. Since then, the geographic range has expanded to include Trinidad and Tobago, Brazil, and Uganda. However, the ecology of JMTV remains poorly described in Africa. We screened adult ticks (n = 4550, 718 pools) for JMTV infection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Ticks were collected from cattle (n = 859, 18.88%), goats (n = 2070, 45.49%), sheep (n = 1574, 34.59%), and free-ranging tortoises (Leopard tortoise, Stigmochelys pardalis) (n = 47, 1.03%) in two Kenyan pastoralist-dominated areas (Baringo and Kajiado counties) with a history of undiagnosed febrile human illness. Surprisingly, ticks collected from goats (0.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1-0.5), sheep (1.8%, 95% CI 1.2-2.5), and tortoise (74.5%, 95% CI 60.9-85.4, were found infected with JMTV, but ticks collected from cattle were all negative. JMTV ribonucleic acid (RNA) was also detected in blood from tortoises (66.7%, 95% CI 16.1-97.7). Intragenetic distance of JMTV sequences originating from tortoise-associated ticks was greater than that of sheep-associated ticks. Phylogenetic analyses of seven complete-coding genome sequences generated from tortoise-associated ticks formed a monophyletic clade within JMTV strains from other countries. In summary, our findings confirm the circulation of JMTV in ticks in Kenya. Further epidemiological surveys are needed to assess the potential public health impact of JMTV in Kenya.

AB  - It is difficult to devise physical models which precisely mimic the body temperatures (T-b's) of large reptiles in the field. Studies of large reptiles have the compensating advantage that individuals can be followed for long periods, so that translocated individuals can be used as 'living models'. We compare T-b's of two tortoise species in an enclosure in Harare (altitude 1500 m) with those in the field at Sengwa (900 m), where mean air temperatures were about 5 degrees C higher. Kinixys spekii, which occurs naturally near Harare, had similar T-b's at the two sites (means 27.6 and 27.0 degrees C, respectively). Geochelone pardalis had significantly lower T-b's in Harare (29.1 degrees C) than at Sengwa (32.6 degrees C), even though activity was shifted towards midday in Harare. The inability to reach high T-b during activity may explain the absence of G. pardalis near Harare, and the distribution of this species in southern Africa.

AB  - Leopard tortoises (n = 162) were collected over a period of 19 months at the National Zoological gardens, Pretoria, South Africa and the attachment sites of larvae, nymphs and adults of A. marmoreum monitored. Most of the larvae (80%) and nymphs (87%) were found on the anterior parts of the tortoise while adults (90%) were found mainly on the posterior regions of the host body. The immature stages were predominant in soft skinned areas protected by the carapace especially the neck and upper leg areas. Male and female ticks were most commonly found on the posterior armpit, posterior legs and the areas surrounding the base of the tail. Interstadial competition as a major factor influencing attachment site segregation is doubtful. Anterior attachment site selection of the immature stages is believed to result largely from ticks lying passively in wait and then climbing onto the host as it moves through the vegetation and the requirement for soft skinned and protected areas to allow for blood feeding. Adult females usually attach posteriorly in areas that allow them to fully engorge without being dislodged by mechanical disturbance, while males prefer to attach at sites where they are protected but still remain in close proximity to female pheromone signals.

AB  - Blood films were examined from 154 wild and captive tortoises from four provinces of South Africa, including Gauteng, Kwazulu-Natal, North West and Western Cape. The five species of chelonians studied were Chersina angulata (Schweigger), Kinixys belliana belliana (Gray), K. lobatsiana Power, K. natalensis Hewitt, and Stigmochelys pardalis (Bell). Two species of haemogregarines, previously reported from Mozambique, were identified in blood films, namely Haemogregarina fitzsimonsi Dias, 1953 and Haemogregarina parvula Dias, 1953. Additional stages of development (trophozoites and probable meronts, merozoites and immature gamonts) in blood preparations from South Africa warranted the redescription of H. fitzsimonsi. A variety of hosts and broad host distribution range were observed for this haemogregarine, with all five species of tortoises parasitized, wild and captive, from all four provinces, in all seasons. In contrast, only two individuals of K. b. belliana and one S. pardalis, all three captive in Kwazulu-Natal, contained H. parvula with encapsulated stages resembling those of Hemolivia mauritanica (Sergent et Sergent, 1904). For H. fitzsimonsi, parasite prevalences, but not parasitaemias, were significantly higher in captive than wild S. pardalis; captive female S. pardalis also showed a significantly greater prevalence of infection than males, but younger, lighter hosts were not significantly more heavily parasitized than older, heavier individuals. The ticks, Amblyomma marmoreum Koch, 1844 and A. sylvaticum (De Geer, 1778), found attached to some tortoises, may prove to be definitive hosts for the two species of haemogregarines observed.

AB  - A survey of Amyblyomma marmoreum Koch ticks recorded from the leopard tortoise, Geochelone paradalis Bell, in the National Zoological Gardens, Pretoria, South Africa, was carried out over a 19-mo period. No significant differences were found between the tick burdens on male and female tortoises. A. marmoreum showed a clear seasonal pattern of abundance. Larvae were present on the tortoise host during late summer, with a peak in February and March; nymphs were abundant during winter, with a peak in June and July Male ticks were found throughout the year, but females were present only during spring and early to midsummer with a peak in October. It was demonstrated that each developmental stage of A. marmoreum showed only one peak of activity per year.

AB  - Studies using the African tortoise tick (Amblyomma marmoreum) and leopard tortoises (Geochelone pardalis) demonstrated that cylluthrin and permethrin were safe and efficacious acaricides for control of Amblyomma ticks on tortoises. A protocol was developed that successfully eradicated an A. sparsum infestation from a tortoise breeding facility in Florida. It involved treatment of all tortoises with a permethrin formulation, followed by treatment of the premises with a cyfluthrin formulation. Sentinel tortoises were later placed on the treated premises to establish successful tick eradication.

AB  - Geochelone pardalis (Bell 1828) shows wide variation of body size in Africa, with tortoises in the north (Republic of Somaliland) being of comparable size to insular giant tortoises. Growth data on G. pardalis, the continental giant species G. sulcata (Miller 1779) and the Aldabran giant tortoise G. gigantea (Schweigger 1812) were re-analysed using Ford-Walford plots, and their growth patterns compared. All species and populations fitted a two-phase growth curve, with initial asymptotic growth followed by slow indeterminate linear growth. Asymptotic growth was non-Bertalanffy in all groups, with most individuals fitting Gompertz or logistic-by-mass models best. Juvenile growth (for ages 3-8) was also approximately linear in all groups. Variation between populations and species was in the rate of juvenile growth, asymptotic size reached, rate of subsequent linear growth, and survival rate of older individuals. Geochelone pardalis from Somaliland had similar juvenile growth rates and asymptotic sizes to other populations, and their large mean size was due to high survival and continued linear growth after the asymptote. Geochelone sulcata had similar juvenile growth rates to G. pardalis, but reached larger asymptotic sizes; indeterminate linear growth was similar to that of G. pardalis. Geochelone gigantea had much higher juvenile growth rates than the continental species, reflecting a longer activity season. Asymptotic size and the rate of indeterminate linear growth were lower in a high-density (Grande Terre) than low-density (Ile Malabar) population of G. gigantea. The growth rate of juveniles was not affected by population density, so that the Grande Terre population had higher growth rates of juveniles relative to larger tortoises and was the only group to approach Bertalanffy-type growth, as predicted.

AB  - Amblyomma marmoreum and A. sparsum ticks were collected from tortoises imported into Florida from Africa and were tested for Cowdria ruminantium infection using a C. ruminantium-specific pCS20 polymerase chain reaction assay. In 1 shipment imported from Zambia, 15 of the 38 A. sparsum male ticks collected from the leopard tortoises (Geochelone pardalis) were found to be positive for infection with C. ruminantium. In contrast, all 148 A. marmoreum tested were negative fur C. ruminantium infection. This is the first reported evidence of the introduction of heartwater-infected ticks into the United States, but there were no opportunities to confirm isolation of C. ruminantium from the ticks by either culture or transmission studies.

AB  - Species-level phylogeny and especially phylogeography of African chelonians is a comparatively under-studied field of research. We review the current knowledge of phylogeny and phylogeography, highlight congruence of spatial phylogeographic patterns amongst chelonians and other taxa and suggest future research directions to address gaps in knowledge. Our review shows that phylogeograph-ic and phylogenetic investigations have led to unexpected findings. For example, for Pelomedusa, a putatively wide-ranging mono-typic terrapin genus, cryptic diversity was revealed, with more than ten species being uncovered. The formerly recognized tortoise genus Homopus sensu lato was found to be paraphyletic with respect to Chersina. To resolve this situation, Homopus was restricted to the four-toed species H. areolatus and H. femoralis and the genus Chersobius was resurrected for the five-toed species C. boulengeri, C. signatus, and C. solus. Three previously recognized taxa were shown to be invalid, viz. the putatively extinct terrapin species Pelusios seychellensis and the tortoise subspecies Chersobius signatus cafer and Stigmochelys pardalis babcocki. Together with taxonomy, the knowledge of phylogeographic structuring sets a solid foundation for conservation measures and allows the identifica-tion of Management and Conservation Units. However, the current legislation, in particular the enforcement of the Nagoya Protocol under the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD), has largely halted research on widely distributed taxa and turned the well -in-tended concept of Access and Benefit Sharing into a major impediment for conservation and research. The current situation leads for many species to a continued usage of outdated and incorrect taxonomic classifications resulting in an error cascade of conservation decisions. This is counterproductive to the aims of the CBD, that is, the protection of biodiversity. Sequencing historical DNA from museum specimens using aDNA approaches could be a short-term approach to mitigate, but not solve, this impediment.

Little is known about acute cholecalciferol-poisoning in domestic animals; no reports are available regarding reptiles. In the case described in this article, immediate therapy led to recovery of the animal and to complete egglaying.

AB  - Movements of the tortoises Geochelone pardalis (mean body mass 4.0 kg) and Kinixys spekii (0.62 kg) were studied by thread-trailing. The mean daily movement distance of G. pardalis was 435 m, and the short-term home-range area was 26 ha. The values for K. spekii were 172 m and 1.9 ha, respectively. The area used by G. pardalis was significantly larger than would be produced by scaling up the movements of K. spekii in the same geometric pattern. Home-range areas were about the same size (K. spekii) or several times as large (G. pardalis) as those predicted for mammals of equal body mass. Ingestion of soil for sodium may be a factor determining the large home range of the purely herbivorous G. pardalis. These tortoises frequented a small area of strongly sodic soil from which they dispersed over long distances.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence and diversity of Campylobacter species in chelonians. From July 2016 to September 2017, a total of 452 individuals from a large variety of tortoises (n = 366) and turtles/terrapins (n = 86) kept in private collections and breeding centres, wildlife rescue centres, zoos, pet shops, and veterinary clinics from Northern Italy was sampled and subjected to microbiological examination. Campylobacter genus and species confirmation was performed by single and multiplex PCRs. Out of 452 samples, five (1.1%) tested positive: three for C. iguaniorum (two Testudo graeca and one Testudo hermanni), one for C. fetus subsp. testudinum (Stigmochelys pardalis) and one for C. geochelonis (Testudo hermanni). This study suggests that Campylobacter spp. are not common in chelonians, but a variety of species can be detected in these hosts, including those potentially pathogenic for humans. Further studies are needed to understand the epidemiology and the pathogenic potential for both animals and humans of reptile-associated Campylobacter spp.

AB  - Following the discovery of establishment of the African tortoise rick Amblyomma marmoreum in Florida, the present study was undertaken to determine the extent of introduction of erode ticks into Florida on imported reptiles. Exotic ticks were identified on 29 (91%) of 32 reptile premises in 18 counties of Florida. The ticks, found on a variety of imported tortoises, snakes, and monitor lizards, belonged co 4 Amblyomma species (A. marmoreum, Amblyomma nuttalli, Amblyomma sabanerae, and Amblyomma sparsum) and 4 Aponomma species (Aponomma exornatum, Aponomma flavomaculatum, Aponomma latum, and Aponomma varanensis). The most commonly encountered ticks were A. latum and A. marmreum. The identifications of A. marmoreum on 8 premises in 7 counties, and of A. sparsum on 1 premises, are of great concern because both species are vectors of heartwater, a lethal disease of cattle, sheep, goats, and deer.

AB  - Chelonian intranuclear coccidiosis has been reported once, in two radiated tortoises (Geochelone radiata), and is apparently rare. We describe intranuclear coccidiosis diagnosed histologically in two radiated tortoises, three Travancore tortoises (Indotestudo forstenii), two leopard tortoises (Geochelone pardalis), one bowsprit tortoise (Chersina angulata), and one impressed tortoise (Manouria impressa). Infection was systemic and involved alimentary, urogenital, respiratory, lymphoid, endocrine, and integumentary systems. Trophozoites, meronts, merozoites, macrogametocytes, microgametocytes, and nonsporulated oocysts were seen histologically or by electron microscopy. Intracytoplasmic and extracellular stages of parasite development also were identified histologically. Sequencing of a coccidial 18S rRNA consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product revealed a novel sequence that provided phylogenetic information and may be useful for further diagnostic test design. Intranuclear coccidiosis was associated with variable degrees of inflammation in all cases, was considered the cause of death in six tortoises, and was a substantial contributing factor to the cause of death in two tortoises.

AB  - Twenty-four juvenile leopard tortoises were divided into four groups of six; one group was fed a basic low-calcium feed for six months, and the other three groups were fed the same basic diet supplemented with one, three and nine times the amount of calcium recommended as a supplement to the diet of reptiles. The animals' bone mineral content and bone mineral density were estimated by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, and blood samples were taken at the start and at the conclusion of the study. One tortoise from each group was examined postmortem. There was a clear depletion of calcium in the body of the tortoises receiving no calcium supplement, and the shell of the tortoises receiving the recommended calcium supplement did not calcify to the extent expected. The tortoises that received three times the recommended calcium supplementation had the highest growth rate and were thriving. However, metastatic calcifications were observed postmortem in the two groups that were given the highest doses of calcium.

AB  - Replacing recently extinct endemic giant tortoises with extant, functional analogues provide the perhaps best examples of island rewilding to date. Yet, an efficient future application of this conservation action is challenging in an era of climate change. We here present and discuss a conceptual framework that can serve as a roadmap for the study and application of tortoise rewilding in an uncertain future. We focus on three main ecological functions mediated by giant tortoises, namely herbivory, seed dispersal and nutrient cycling, and discuss how climate change is likely to impact these. We then propose and discuss mitigation strategies such as artificial constructed shade sites and water holes that can help drive and maintain the ecosystem functions provided by the tortoises on a landscape scale. The application of the framework and the mitigation strategies are illustrated with examples from both wild and rewilded populations of the Aldabra giant tortoise, Aldabrachelys gigantea, in the Western Indian Ocean.

AB  - We examined the activity patterns of angulate tortoises, Chersina angulata, on Dassen Island, South Africa, during spring, summer and winter. During typical spring and summer days, C. angulata exhibited a bimodal pattern of activity, with activity being suspended around midday. However, during winter, and on cool and wet summer days, activity was unimodal, peaking around midday. Temporal patterns of activity appeared strongly influenced by environmental factors, particularly temperature. Chersina angulata were never observed to be active at air temperatures below 14.0degreesC or above 28.7degreesC. Activity levels were lowest during summer, when animals were active only 1.75% of the time. Brief appearances of available water (usually from condensing fog) during summer, however, resulted in a dramatic increase in activity levels. Males were significantly more active than females during summer and spring, but no significant difference was found between the sexes in winter. Results of this study are principally contrasted with those from a study conducted near the easternmost range of C. angulata, an area that experiences a markedly different climate.

AB  - State-level conservation in South Africa is structured around distinct political entities (i.e. municipalities). This is problematic because an ecological approach that considers species distribution is required to delineate meaningful management units. To do so, vegetation types can be used as management units-however, it is uncertain whether vertebrate communities are associated with vegetation types as defined by the national vegetation map. Here, we investigate mammal diversity patterns within and among biomes (savannah and grassland) and bioregions and test whether different mammal communities were associated with different vegetation types. We used an extensive database of species occurrences in the North West Province. We found that species richness was higher in the savannah than grassland biome. Beta diversity was higher within the savannah than grassland biome, due to greater environmental heterogeneity, though one grassland bioregion was similar to the savannah bioregions. Mammal communities were significantly different among bioregions, but not biomes, suggesting mammal communities are congruent with vegetation type at finer scales (i.e. bioregional), but not at coarser scales (biomes). It thus makes sense to use a bioregional framework to design mammal management strategies. The invasion of grasslands by savannah species should be monitored, specifically given the predicted changes in climate.

AB  - Between April 1997 and June 1998, 159 tick collections, comprising 411 specimens, were made from 261 adults and juveniles of the furrowed wood turtle, Rhinoclemmys areolata (Dumeril and Bibron), on a tract of pine forest and savanna in northern Belize. All ticks were determined to be Amblyomma sabanerae Stoll, a common parasite of testudines in the lowland tropics of Central America. Male ticks were collected from more turtles (94) than were females (48) or immatures (82). However, despite the likelihood that male turtles have greater home ranges, significantly more ticks parasitized female turtles than males. It is thought that overdispersion of both ticks and turtles declines in the equable climate of the Neotropics, in which case female turtles, being larger than males, would be expected to acquire more ticks. Collections of immature A. sabanerae were more frequently made on fleshy areas of R. areolata, but the mean number of nymphs and larvae collected from anterior areas was not significantly different from that for posterior areas.

AB  - Herbivory is the dominant feeding strategy in tortoises, and dietary shifts are common in response to changes in resource availability. We conducted the first large-scale study of the diets of wild Hermann's Tortoises (Testudo hermanni hermanni) and found that the study population in central Italy was strictly herbivorous. The tortoises ate primarily legume leaves and grasses in the spring, and switched to flowers and unripe fruit of Ruscus aculeatus as these became available in the autumn. There were no significant differences between the diets of males and females. Although tortoise diets included both rare and abundant plant species, they consumed abundant plant species in a higher proportion than those species occurred in the study area. However, some rare plants made up relatively large fractions of the diet, and one of the few nonnative plants (Conyza canadensis) at the study area was eaten frequently by tortoises in all seasons, despite its relative rarity. Ruscus aculeatus berries may be particularly valuable to tortoises that are about to enter hibernation; hence. T. hermanni habitat should be managed to maintain this important plant species.

AB  - Biomacromolecules have transformed our capacity to effectively treat diseases; however, their rapid degradation and poor absorption in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract generally limit their administration to parenteral routes. An oral biologic delivery system must aid in both localization and permeation to achieve systemic drug uptake. Inspired by the leopard tortoise's ability to passively reorient, we developed an ingestible self-orienting millimeter-scale applicator (SOMA) that autonomously positions itself to engage with GI tissue. It then deploys milliposts fabricated from active pharmaceutical ingredients directly through the gastric mucosa while avoiding perforation. We conducted in vivo studies in rats and swine that support the applicator's safety and, using insulin as a model drug, demonstrated that the SOMA delivers active pharmaceutical ingredient plasma levels comparable to those achieved with subcutaneous millipost administration.

AB  - To date, only a single species of Hemolivia, Hemolivia mauritanica (Sergent & Sergent, 1904), has been described from African terrestrial tortoises. Although various haemogregarines have been described from southern African terrapins and tortoises, including species from the genus Haemogregarina and one from the genus Hepatozoon, no species of Hemolivia have been identified previously from southern Africa. Since its morphological redescription, the taxonomic placement of one of these species, Haemogregarina parvula Dias, 1953, was in doubt. Hence, research was undertaken to resolve the true taxonomic position of this haemogregarine. Blood smears from nine wild tortoises of two species, Stigmochelys pardalis and Kinixys zombensis, from South Africa were screened, with the focus on H. parvula. Parasite DNA was extracted from ethanol-preserved blood samples, and fragments of the 18S rDNA gene were amplified by PCR using the primer sets HepF300/HepR900 and 4558/2733. Maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony analyses of 18S rDNA sequences showed that Haemogregarina parvula formed a monophyletic clade with species of Hemolivia within the Hepatozoon clade, not with species of Haemogregarina. It is thus recommended that this haemogregarine be reassigned to the genus Hemolivia, rendering Hemolivia parvula (Dias, 1953) the first species of the genus recorded from southern African tortoises.

AB  - Four of the five tortoise species in Madagascar, Pyxis arachnoides, P. planicauda, Geochelone radiata, and G. yniphora, are endemic and on the verge of extinction, Their phylogenetic relationships remain controversial and unresolved. Here we address the phylogeny of this group using DNA sequences for the 12S and 16S rDNA and cyt b genes in mitochondrial DNA. As outgroups we used two species of Geochelone, pardalis (mainland Africa) and nigra (Galapagos), as well as a more distant North American tortoise, Gopherus polyphemus, We conclude that the two Pyxis species are sister taxa and are imbedded in the genus Geochelone, rendering this latter genus paraphyletic. There is moderate support for the sister status of the two Madagascar Geochelone and for the monophyletic origin of all four endemics, suggesting a single colonization of the island. The separation of Madagascar from other land masses (90-165 mya) predates the origin of the endemic tortoises (estimated to be 14-22 mya), This suggests founding by rafting, a process known to have occurred with other tortoises. The derived morphological divergence of the Pyxis species in a relatively short period of time (13-20 my) stands in contrast to the notoriously slow rate of morphological evolution in most lineages of Chelonia.

AB  - Recent studies showed that freshwater turtles display inter-individual differences in various behavioural traits, which may influence their health and welfare in captivity due to differences in response to husbandry and enrichment strategies and in ability to cope with the limitations of the captive environment. This study investigated a possible correlation between individual level of escape behaviour under standard enrichment conditions and level of interest in coloured objects in a group of cooters Pseudemys sp. and sliders Trachemys scripta ssp. on display at a public aquarium. Interest in different colours, colour preference and individual differences in behavioural changes in the presence of the new enrichment were also studied. Turtles categorised as 'high' and 'moderate escape behaviour' (17-34% of behavioural budget) showed more interest in coloured objects and tended to display less escape behaviour in their presence, while turtles categorised as 'low escape behaviour' (<10% of behavioural budget) were less interested in coloured objects and tended to display more escape behaviour in their presence. Overall, there was more interest in yellow than in red, white or green objects, with more contacts with coloured objects before feeding and at the start of each observation period and a preference for yellow against red objects. The individual differences in behavioural changes in the presence of the new enrichment suggested that more studies into colour preference and response to novelty in turtles would be beneficial to ensure that no individuals are unduly stressed by new enrichments.

AB  - The diet of an Algerian population of spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) was studied with the aims of exploring: (i) the variation in diet among males, females and juveniles, (ii) the relationships between consumption and relative availability of the plant species, and (iii) which plant tissues, vegetative or reproductive, are eaten by tortoises. We recorded more than forty plant species at the study area, with monocot species (n = 7) having a greater percent cover than that of dicot species (n = 31 species) or Gymnospermae (n = 2). Tortoise diet was studied by categorising 4422 plant and animal fragments in faecal pellets of 20 males, 16 females and eight juveniles. Tortoises ate a wide variety of plant species, including 13 dicots and three monocots, and occasionally invertebrates. The number of fragments for a plant species was correlated with plant species cover, and plant vegetative tissues exceeded plant reproductive tissues in the faeces. Dicots (Fabaceae, Composeae, Primulaceae, and Caryophyllaceae) accounted for over 70% of the diet (faecal fragments). The high dietary (niche) overlap, and null model analysis (RA3 algorithm with 30,000 Monte Carlo simulations), indicate that males, females and juveniles did not partition fund resources; all three groups ate the same plant species.

AB  - Live and dead Kinixys spekii were collected in the Sengwa Wildlife Research Area, Zimbabwe over a 12-year period. Live tortoises were sexable at a midline plastron length of 100 mm: females were considered sexually mature at 140 mm (reached by age 9 years) and males at 120 mm. (at age 7 years). Adult females were significantly larger than males. on average by 14 mm in length and by 1.43 times in mass, Mark-recapture analysis in a 2 km(2) area showed a population density of sexable tortoises of 0.16 ha(-1). The survival rate was estimated by recaptures, by the frequency distribution of age at death, and by the mean age of live tortoises, and averaged 0.74 year(-1). Seventy-seven to 89% of dead tortoises showed evidence of predation, depending on the criteria used. Damage occurred in characteristic forms, loss of the front or rear of the plastron, or holes in the carapace and plastron, which were attributed to predation by mammals and ground hornbills, respectively. K. spekii had similar body size and sexual size dimorphism to Mediterranean tortoises (Testudo), but population density was much lower and the mortality rate was twice as high, probably due to the abundant African predators. High mortality was offset by a rate of juvenile growth twice that of Testudo.

AB  - Movements of five Kinixys spekii were measured continuously during six weeks of their activity season, by thread-trailing. The mean daily movement distance was negatively correlated with maximum shade air temperature. but not significantly related to minimum temperature, rainfall, or humidity. There was a midday period of inactivity of increasing length as maximum air temperature exceeded 29 degrees C. Temperatures of models suggest that lower activity on hot days was due to the risk of overheating in this small (mean mass 617 g) tortoise. Kinixys spekii had a mean field body temperature (T-b) of 27 degrees C, which is low compared to other tortoises (including sympatric Geochelone pardalis, mean T-b = 32.5 degrees C), but salivated al a similar T-b (38.4 degrees C). This pattern also occurs in other small species; mean and maximum field T(b)s Of tortoises are positively correlated with body mass, but salivation and critical maximum T(b)s do not vary with body mass. Low field T-b provides a wide safely margin before evaporation of water becomes necessary. Kinixys spekii had a short annual activity period, with about 95% of sightings in four months (December to March). Monthly sightings of K. spekii were correlated with rainfall, but not significantly related to temperature or humidify. Seasonal activity is therefore related to rainfall,but within the rainy season the level and pattern of daily activity is related to temperature.

AB  - Entamoeba invadens is a protozoal parasite of reptiles that causes colitis, abscesses of liver and other organs, and sometimes acute death. It is generally considered a commensal of chelonians but has also been implicated as a cause of colitis, diarrhea, and death in gopher (Gopherus polyphemus) and leopard (Geochelone pardalis) tortoises. Diagnosis of E. invadens is currently by detection of trophozoites and/or cysts upon direct fecal examination. However, definitive diagnosis of E. invadens has been difficult due to the very similar morphology of nonpathogenic Entamoeba spp., including E. ranarum, E. insolita, E. barreti, and E. terrapinae. Definitive speciation of Entamoeba spp. is important to avoid misdiagnosis or overtreatment for nonpathogenic protozoa. It is also important for consideration of mixed species reptile collections to avoid exposing snakes and lizards to E. invadens. In this study, we developed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers for E. invadens, E. ranarum, E. terrapinae, and E. insolita and conducted PCR amplification of purified DNA from cell cultures, as well as purified DNA from reptile stool samples with E. invadens trophozoites added. As a result of this study, a naturally occurring infection of E. invadens was confirmed in a giant South American river turtle (Podocnemis expansa). This study has developed successful PCR primers for four species of Entamoeba and demonstrates that PCR is a promising diagnostic tool for the definitive identification of E. invadens.

AB  - Home range analysis is a standard and fundamental concept in ecology used to describe animal space use over their lifetimes. Connecting home range sizes with animal characteristics, location, and habitat can be used to inform conservation decisions. Reptiles are frequently lacking robust estimates of space use, particularly reptiles in tropical regions. Here we analyse a publicly available dataset, collected by the authors of this study, describing the movements of Critically Endangered Elongated tortoises Indotestudo elongata. The tortoise data included the locations of 17 tortoises (12 females, 5 males) collected on average once every three days for an average duration of 353.76 SE +/- 33.10 days. We use these data to estimate the home range of Elongated tortoise, and explore how tortoise size and sex influences home range size. To mitigate issues resulting from low effective sample sizes and low temporal resolution of the data, we used a modern home range estimation method - Autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimators (AKDE). We found 14 of 17 individuals appear to be occupying a stable home range (using variograms to determine range residency). The average AKDE home range for all 14 individuals with range residency was 44.81 +/- 10.44 ha. Bayesian Regression Models suggest comparable size estimates between male and female home ranges, despite males being physically larger than females in both mass and carapace length. These AKDE home range estimates have the added utility of being more comparable with other studies, less susceptible to errors from a suboptimal tracking regime, and are well positioned for inclusion in future meta-analyses.

AB  - We studied the temperature relations of wild and zoo Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) focusing on (1) the relationship between environmental temperature and tortoise activity patterns (n=8 wild individuals) and (2) on tortoise body temperature fluctuations, including how their core and external body temperatures vary in relation to different environmental temperature ranges (seasons; n=4 wild and n=5 zoo individuals). In addition, we surveyed the literature to review the effect of body mass on core body temperature range in relation to environmental temperature in the Testudinidae. Diurnal activity of tortoises was bimodally distributed and influenced by environmental temperature and season. The mean air temperature at which activity is maximized was 27.9 degrees C, with a range of 25.8-31.7 degrees C. Furthermore, air temperature explained changes in the core body temperature better than did mass, and only during the coldest trial, did tortoises with higher mass show more stable temperatures. Our results, together with the overall Testudinidae overview, suggest that, once variation in environmental temperature has been taken into account, there is little effect of mass on the temperature stability of tortoises. Moreover, the presence of thermal inertia in an individual tortoise depends on the environmental temperatures, and we found no evidence for inertial homeothermy. Finally, patterns of core and external body temperatures in comparison with environmental temperatures suggest that Aldabra giant tortoises act as mixed conformer-regulators. Our study provides a baseline to manage the thermal environment of wild and rewilded populations of an important island ecosystem engineer species in an era of climate change.

AB  - Heterophylly (juvenile-adult leaf dimorphism) is widespread among native woody species of the Mascarene Islands, but the causes to this phenomenon have so far not been fully explained. The absence of mammals and dominance of now extinct giant tortoises and flightless birds are characteristics of the original Mascarene fauna. The present study investigates the hypothesis that the distinct morphology and colouration of juvenile leaves signalled unpalatability to browsing giant tortoises or birds. juvenile and adult leaves of 28 heterophyllous woody species endemic to the islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues were screened for possible chemical defences against herbivory. The screening comprised the following classes of secondary compounds: alkaloids, cyanogenic constituents, saponins, simple phenolics, tannins and anthocyanins. The screening showed that there are no consistent significant differences between juvenile and adult leaves regarding any of the studied secondary compound classes, with the exception of the level of anthocyanins, which was significantly higher in juvenile leaves. This difference was also clearly reflected in a generally high degree of red patterning of juvenile leaves. Based on comparisons with floras of other oceanic islands once inhabited by tortoises and birds, and an evaluation of feeding habits of these herbivores, we suggest that the reduced lamina and partly red colouration of juvenile leaves may be an evolutionary response to selective herbivory by birds.

AB  - Heartwater is a tick-borne infectious disease caused by the rickettsial organism Cowdria ruminantium, currently Ehrlichia ruminantium. It poses an imminent threat to the Western Hemisphere, where it could cause mortality in cattle and other ruminant livestock in excess of 70%. It has been reported in the Caribbean; and its vector, Amblyomma sparsum, has been found on imported African spurred tortoises (Geochelone sulcata) and leopard tortoises (Geochelone pardalis) in southern Florida in the United States, leading to an importation ban on these reptiles. Symptoms have not been previously reported in reptiles. Here, we report peracute and acute deaths in African vipers imported from Africa through Florida. Signs included vomiting mucoid fluid, diarrhea, emaciation, convulsions, and death. Postmortem showed few gross lesions. The most consistent peracute and acute lesions were the pulmonary lesions and pericarditis with considerable bloody fluid in the pericardial sac (hydropericardium). These lesions strongly resembled the lesions of heartwater and a coccobacillus of less than 1-micron diameter was isolated in viper cell culture. The outbreak was brought to a halt by tick control and treatment of all exposed snakes with tetracycline. This isolation, tetracycline sensitivity, clinical signs, preliminary results with polymerase chain reaction of pCS20 ORF, and the viper preference of the disease may indicate a Cowdria-related attenuated species that has adapted to infect reptiles or an emerging new form of this group of microbes.

AB  - The conservation of tortoises poses a unique situation because several threatened species are commonly kept as pets within their native ranges. Thus, there is potential for captive populations to be a reservoir for repatriation efforts. We assess the utility of captive populations of the threatened Agassiz's desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) for recovery efforts based on genetic affinity to local areas. We collected samples from 130 captive desert tortoises from three desert communities: two in California (Ridgecrest and Joshua Tree) and the Desert Tortoise Conservation Center (Las Vegas) in Nevada. We tested all samples for 25 short tandem repeats and sequenced 1,109 bp of the mitochondrial genome. We compared captive genotypes to a database of 1,258 Gopherus samples, including 657 wild caught G. agassizii spanning the full range of the species. We conducted population assignment tests to determine the genetic origins of the captive individuals. For our total sample set, only 44 % of captive individuals were assigned to local populations based on genetic units derived from the reference database. One individual from Joshua Tree, California, was identified as being a Morafka's desert tortoise, G. morafkai, a cryptic species which is not native to the Mojave Desert. Our data suggest that captive desert tortoises kept within the native range of G. agassizii cannot be presumed to have a genealogical affiliation to wild tortoises in their geographic proximity. Precautions should be taken before considering the release of captive tortoises into the wild as a management tool for recovery.

AB  - A previous study on the feeding habits of Moorish tortoises in west-central Morocco suggests that these animals are selective herbivores, but the nutritional consequences have not been examined. Because of the potassium excretion load, which requires water and/or nitrogen loss, we predicted that tortoises do not have salt glands. Moorish tortoises prefer plants rich in water and protein but low in potassium (PEP index). To this end, we studied the spring diet of adult tortoises in an arid steppe in west-central Morocco during two seasons of relatively dry years (2011-2012) using feces analyses. We also estimated the relative abundance of potential food plants by stratified sampling under the canopy of jujube bushes Ziziphus lotus. We statistically compared diet to plant abundance. Finally, we assessed plant species' nutritional composition (water, crude protein, and potassium) available to tortoises. Results showed that species assemblages differed significantly between the two plant communities in both years. Nevertheless, tortoises consumed only about 5-6 and nearly the same species at the study site in 2011 and 2012, respectively. The plants consumed by the tortoises had the highest positive PEP index values indicating that there was more water and nitrogen in the food than is needed to excrete potassium.

AB  - Great environmental changes may affect the survival capability of a variety of organisms. Testudinidae is the most diverse family of terrestrial chelonians within the whole order (Testudines). Interestingly, however, the number of extinct species overcome the extant ones. In order to understand better how the diversification process of this family occurred, this work used the PyRate software, which estimates both the preservation and diversification processes in a continuous time interval. For such, the software used a list of fossil occurrences obtained from the Paleobiology Database whereas the extant species list was obtained from Catalogue of Life. This way, the software was able to infer the probability of the ancestral clade having resulted in these species during its evolutionary history. The analyses generated graphs containing the diversification, extinction and speciation curves and their respective associated 95% credibility intervals. A great rise in the extinction rate was observed starting 6 million years ago. This rise is believed to be related to the drop of atmospheric CO2 all over the globe at the end of the Miocene, about 8-6 million years ago. This event led to a turnover of the vegetation composition on the warmer areas of the planet, with plants that used C3 metabolism giving way to C4 plants. In terms of landscape, grasses and herbal vegetation, such as savannas, started dominating. As for other animal groups, those herbivores with grazing habits were more successful than those used to only browsing or that did not have enough flexibility of choice.

AB  - Food and non-food plant characteristics were studied for the geometric tortoise, Psammobates geometricus, to test the hypothesis that feeding preferences in tortoises may be influenced by the mechanical properties of plant leaves. Twelve focal feeding observations made between 8 October and 31 October 2002 were synthesized with literature reports to develop species Lists of food and non-food grasses and geophytes in renosterveld habitat. Failure load and tensile strength were determined in the field for leaves of food and non-food plants that were spatially available to the tortoises and present in relative abundance during the course of the study. Leaves of geophyte food plants were fleshy and succulent with a low failure load and tensile strength. Leaves of food plant grasses had significantly higher failure loads and tensile strengths compared to leaves of food plant geophytes. In non-food plants there was no significant difference in failure load between grasses and geophytes, but tensile strength was significantly higher in the grasses. Non-food plant grasses and geophytes overall had significantly higher failure load and tensile strength values than did food plants. Two non-food plants that overlapped in mechanical strength to the food plants either have toxic/unpalatable chemicals in high amounts or are recent invasive species to the renosterveld. Thus. these studies support the hypothesis that leaf biomechanical properties may be an important factor in determining the diet of the geometric tortoise and perhaps tortoises in general.

AB  - Perivitelline membrane (PVM)-bound sperm detection has recently been incorporated into avian breeding programs to assess egg fertility, confirm successful copulation, and to evaluate male reproductive status and pair compatibility. Due to the similarities between avian and chelonian egg structure and development, and because fertility determination in chelonian eggs lacking embryonic growth is equally challenging, PVM-bound sperm detection may also be a promising tool for the reproductive management of turtles and tortoises. This study is the first to successfully demonstrate the use of PVM-bound sperm detection in chelonian eggs. Recovered membranes were stained with Hoechst 33342 and examined for sperm presence using fluorescence microscopy. Sperm were positively identified for up to 206 days post-oviposition, following storage, diapause, and/or incubation, in 52 opportunistically collected eggs representing 12 species. However, advanced microbial infection frequently hindered the ability to detect membrane-bound sperm. Fertile Centrochelys sulcata, Manouria emys, and Stigmochelys pardalis eggs were used to evaluate the impact of incubation and storage on the ability to detect sperm. Storage at -20 degrees C or in formalin were found to be the best methods for egg preservation prior to sperm detection. Additionally, sperm-derived mtDNA was isolated and PCR amplified from Astrochelys radiata, C. sulcata, and S. pardalis eggs. PVM-bound sperm detection has the potential to substantially improve studies of artificial incubation and sperm storage, and could be used to evaluate the success of artificial insemination in chelonian species. Mitochondrial DNA from PVM-bound sperm has applications for parentage analysis, the study of sperm competition, and potentially species identification. Zoo Biol. 35:95-103, 2016.

AB  - We do not know whether the availability of food plants is the primary factor enabling Angulate Tortoises to inhabit a wide variety of habitats along the southern and western coasts of South Africa. Here we used focal observations to study the diet of Angulate Tortoises over four seasons at two distinct sites in the southwestern Cape, the West Coast National Park (WCNP), and Dassen Island (DI). Seasonal fluctuations in temperature, rainfall, and food plant availability influenced the activity pattern and feeding activity of Angulate Tortoises. Tortoises were more active during the wet season, winter and spring, than during the dry season, summer and autumn. Diet differed between sites and among seasons. WCNP tortoises had a diverse diet of grasses, shrubs, herbs, and succulents, whereas DI tortoises ate mostly herbaceous plants. DI tortoises had few dietary choices available compared to choices available to WCNP tortoises. At both sites, herbs and seedlings were important diet components during the wet season. The dry season diet consisted largely of dry plant material. Angulate Tortoises on DI supplemented their intake of dry plant material with rabbit feces, which comprised more than 27% of the diet in summer and autumn. The opportunistic feeding behavior of Angulate Tortoises helps explain their distribution among a wide variety of habitats. Their persistence in disturbed areas is probably determined by the abundance of easily digestible, herbaceous plants during the wet season and the tortoises' low activity and low metabolic demands during unfavorable periods.

AB  - Most of the 42 living species of tortoise (Testudinidae) are herbivorous, feeding largely on vascular plants, with the exception of the genus Kinixys, which is omnivorous. A comparison of Kinixys spekii and Geochelone pardalis showed the following significant differences. The large intestine was shorter in K. spekii (86% of plastron length and 1.8% of body mass) than in G. pardalis (246 and 2.5%) and held a smaller proportion of the total gut contents (44 and 62%, respectively). The apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) of organic matter was lower in K. spekii (77%) than in G. pardalis (82%) fed kale; the ADC of holocellulose was higher and did not differ between the two species. Kinixys spekii did not readily consume grass, which is more difficult to digest than kale; the ADC of organic matter was 64% in G. pardalis. The time to first excretion (t(0)) was lower in K. spekii (2.2 days) than in G. pardalis (3.8 days). Other measures of retention time (t(50), t(max), and (t) over bar) did not differ between the species, or between the two diets in G. pardalis. Analysis of published data on chelonians fed foliage shows that the ratio of large intestine to small intestine lengths is significantly related to gut retention time (r = 0.88) but not to the ADC (r = -0.28). Thus, although the short large intestine of K. spekii slightly reduces the gut retention time and digestibility of dicotyledonous leaves, the most important effect is a low ability to process grass and other coarse vegetation.

AB  - Objective: Tortoise picornavirus (ToPV) has been speculated to play an important role in the frequently seen disease pattern of juvenile shell softening. This study aimed to determine ToPV prevalence among German tortoise collections. Material and methods: A total of 334 animals selected from 27 different collections were included. Seven species of four genera of the family Testudinidae (Testudo graeca, T. hermanni, T. marginata, T. horsfieldii, Centrochelys sulcata, Stigmochelys pardalis, Chelonoidis carbonarius) were sampled. The tortoises were clinically investigated and none of the adults showed any signs of shell softening. Seven hatchlings of a ToPV-positive T. graeca breeding pair showed retarded growth and a progressive shell weakness that resulted in death. Each animal was sampled by conjunctival, pharyngeal and cloacal swabs (990 swabs in total) and blood sampling (293 in total). All three swabs of one animal were pooled and tested by reverse transcriptase polymerise chain reaction (RT-PCR) for tortoise picornavirus RNA. Blood samples were investigated by virus neutralisation test (VNT) for specific anti ToPV antibodies. All titres equal to or higher than log(2) = 2 were considered positive. Results: In total, 35 adult and 11 juvenile animals were tested positive for ToPV RNA. The serological investigation did detect specific antibodies against ToPV in 44 adult tortoises and one juvenile. In total, 76 animals were tested positive in either one of the investigations, 16 animals in both. The highest number of ToPV-positive animals was found for T. graeca, with a prevalence of 32 %. No specimens of C. carbonarius, C. sulcata, or S. pardalis were tested positive. Conclusion and clinical relevance: The results propose a predisposition in T graeca, as well as a high prevalence of ToPV in T. graeca, whereas other species showed only single or no positive animals, but may function as virus carriers.

AB  - Although tortoises (Testudinidae) are a familiar clade of reptiles, with a body fossil record extending to at least the Eocene, hitherto no tortoise ichnosites have been described. Here, a number of sites attributed to tortoise trackmakers are identified within Pleistocene aeolianites on South Africa's Cape south coast. These date from late Marine Isotope Stage 6 to Marine Isotope Stage 4. The findings indicate large trackmakers, with evidence of a trackmaker length of more than a meter-substantially longer than the largest extant tortoises in southern Africa. This suggests either the presence of an extinct very large tortoise species, or that Pleistocene leopard tortoises in the region were larger than their descendants. Variations in substrate properties are responsible for a variety of track and trace forms. A mismatch exists between the reported ichnological evidence for large tortoises, and the regional archaeological and body fossil records, which almost exclusively comprise smaller tortoises. The findings illustrate the potential of ichnology to complement and augment the paleontological and archaeological records.

AB  - The international trade in live reptiles has grown dramatically in the last decade. Since many of these reptiles are infested with ticks, the number of ticks introduced to new exotic locations has also increased. This is causing concern in importing countries such as the United States because some of the reptilian ticks are known to be vectors of diseases of veterinary and economic importance, such as heartwater. Rational measures to control these tick species and to eradicate new introductions have been slow to develop due in part to the scattered and often obscure sources of available data on the exotic ticks. This review is an attempt to collate information on the geographical distribution, host range, life cycle and associations with diseases for four Amblyomma species, A. marmoreum Koch, A. nuttalli Donitz, A. sabanerae Stoll and A. sparsum Neumann, and for four Aponomma species, A. exornatum (Koch), A. flavomaculatum (Lucas), A. latum (Koch) and A. varanensis (Supino), that have recently been introduced into Florida, USA on imported reptiles.

AB  - Previous studies of desert tortoise foraging ecology in the western Mojave Desert suggest that these animals are selective herbivores, which alter their diet according to the temporal availability of preferred food plants. These studies, however, did not estimate availability of potential food plants by taking into account the spatial and temporal variability in ephemeral plant abundance that occurs within the spring season. In this study, we observed 18 free-ranging adult tortoises take 35,388 bites during the spring foraging season. We also estimated the relative abundance of potential food plants by stratifying our sampling across different phenological periods of the 3-month long spring season and by different habitats and microhabitats. This methodology allowed us to conduct statistical tests comparing tortoise diet against plant abundance. Our results show that tortoises choose food plants non-randomly throughout the foraging season, a finding that corroborates the hypothesis that desert tortoises rely on key plants during different phenological periods of spring. Moreover, tortoises only consumed plants in a succulent state until the last few weeks of spring, at which time most annuals and herbaceous perennials had dried and most tortoises had ceased foraging. Many species of food plants-including several frequently eaten species-were not detected in our plant surveys, yet tortoises located these rare plants in their home ranges. Over 50% of bites consumed were in the group of undetected species. Interestingly, tortoises focused heavily on several leguminous species, which could be nutritious foods owing to their presumably high nitrogen contents. We suggest that herbaceous perennials, which were rare on our study area but represented similar to 30% of tortoise diet, may be important in sustaining tortoise populations during droughts when native annuals are absent. These findings highlight the vulnerability of desert tortoises to climate change if such changes alter the availability of their preferred food plants.

AB  - In this study I reviewed the studies on the community organization of terrestrial turtles to examine the main patterns of resource partitioning, and to predict whether interspecific competition may be or may not be an important organizing force for these ectotherms. These reptiles exhibit four (nearly) constant ecological/life-history traits that may affect the role and the influence of interspecific competition: (i) low species richness, (ii) high longevity, (iii) herbivorous/omnivorous dietary habits, and (iv) low population density. Based on the expectations derived from these ecological characteristics, I predicted that interspecific competition should be of lesser relevance for these turtle communities than for other reptilian communities (lizards, snakes). After reviewing the international literature, I concluded that most of the turtle communities around the world appear currently uninfluenced by interspecific competition. Much of their species diversity reflects geographic replacement of one species by another. In the regions of the world where two or more species are sympatric, current interspecific competition is also of relatively low importance, because the sympatric species tend to partition very clearly the spatial axis or the food axis. By Monte Carlo simulations of niche overlap data versus current niche overlap data at a geographic region in tropical Africa where the community ecology of three sympatric species of terrestrial turtles, three of scincid lizards, four of chameleons, and nineteen of snakes, was accurately studied, I concluded that the interspecific competition among turtles was statistically lower than that among these other reptiles, with the spatial niche being the niche dimension most clearly partitioned by turtles in comparison with the other ectotherms. Hence, terrestrial turtles would be unusual among reptiles with respect to the un-influence of the competition process for their community ecology.

AB  - Despite being ectotherms, reptiles have an ability to thermoregulate which is enhanced by adopting a variety of behavioural mechanisms. Different behavioural postures, the use of retreat sites and selection of microhabitats enable reptiles to maintain their core body temperatures (T-b) above that of ambient temperatures (T-a) in winter or below T-a maximum in summer. This study describes the daily activity patterns of leopard tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis) in relation to T-b and T-a, and the extent to which leopard tortoises can manipulate their T-b in response to seasonal changes in T-a. Ten and nine leopard tortoises were radio-tracked in 2002 and 2003, respectively and cloacal T-b and behaviours observed. Core T(b)s were measured using Thermocron iButtons (TM) surgically implanted into the body cavities of 4 and 5 adult telemetered tortoises for summer and winter 2003, respectively. There were seasonal differences in the extent to which certain behaviours were practiced and the time of day that these occurred. Leopard tortoises generally had unimodal activity patterns in winter and bimodal ones in summer. In winter tortoises were active at lower T(b)s, and at lower T-a, than in summer. Tortoises maintained their core T-b well below T-a minimum profiles in summer and well above these in winter. Core T-b closely followed the increase in T-a minimum profiles in the mornings, however tortoises exhibited an extended thermal lag when T-a minimum profiles cooled overnight. By using different behavioural mechanisms in summer and winter, leopard tortoises maintained their core T-b at different levels compared with T-a minimum and maximum profiles. Consequently although they are ectotherms, they maintained their core T-b independent of T-a. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We used a five-gene data set (mtDNA: 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, cyt-b; nDNA: Cmos, Rag2) comprising approximately two-thirds of all extant testudinid species and, for the first time, including all five Testudo species to investigate the question of whether all western Palaearctic testudinids are monophyletic. Further, we examined whether the recently suggested allocation of the African Geochelone pardalis in the otherwise exclusively South African genus Psammobates and of the Malagasy G. yniphora in the monotypic genus Angonoka is justified in the face of considerable morphological evidence against such placements. Our phylogenetic analyses do not support the paraphyly and generic break-up of Testudo, as suggested by previous papers using a smaller taxon sampling and mtDNA data only. We propose a continued usage of the generic name Testudo for all five western Palaearctic tortoise species. Within Testudo, two monophyletic subclades are present, one containing T hermanni+ T horsfieldii, and the other comprising (T kleinmanni + T marginata) + T graeca. Nomenclaturally, we demonstrate that Eurotestudo Lapparent de Broin et al., 2006, which was recently erected with the type species T hermanni, is an objective junior synonym of Chersine Merrem, 1820 and Medaestia Wussow, 1916. Recognition of a monotypic genus Angonoka for G. yniphora is unwarranted according to both our re-analysis of sequence data and morphological data. Acknowledging the strong morphological similarity between G. yniphora and G. radiata, we suggest placing both species into the genus Astrochelys. Although sequence data for only one of the three Psammobates species was available for analysis, there is currently no cause to challenge the monophyly of this genus as established on the basis of morphological evidence. Thus, we hypothesize that G. pardalis is sister to a monophyletic Psammobates. In light of the clear morphological gap between G. pardalis and Psammobates species, the recognition of a distinct genus Stigmochelys for the former seems justified. (c) 2007 Elsevier GrnbH.

AB  - In 1973 the Convention in International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) was called to life as to regulate the international wildlife trade, and to prevent species becoming (economically and biologically) extinct. The trade in freshwater turtles and tortoises in Asia is so huge that it threatens the survival of many species. In 2006 and 2007, during three surveys at Chatuchak market in Bangkok, Thailand, we recorded a significant trade in non-native CITES-listed freshwater turtles and tortoises to be used as pets. We documented a total of 688 individuals of 19 species from different regions of the world, many of which are globally threatened with extinction. Most commonly recorded were three species of tortoise from Madagascar and Africa, i.e. Radiated Tortoise Geochelone radiata, Spurred Tortoise G. sulcata and Leopard Tortoise G. pardalis. Five species were listed on CITES Appendix I, precluding all international trade, and an additional six Appendix II or III-listed species that can be traded albeit regulated, were not registered as being imported into Thailand in the last six year. CITES I-listed species were not more expensive than CITES II or III listed species, nor was there a relationship between retail price and numbers of turtles observed. The large number and availability of illegally sourced animals indicates a blatant disregard for law and authority by traders both from Thailand and from exporting countries. We conclude that the trade in these species, in such significant volumes, is of serious conservation concern, and in order for CITES to be more effective it is imperative that Parties recognize the scale of the international trade in freshwater turtles and tortoises and respond accordingly.

AB  - Background: Hematologic and plasma biochemical evaluations are routinely used in evaluating the chelonian patient, but appropriate processing techniques have been minimally defined. Objectives: This study was designed to compare the effects of temperature, time, anticoagulant, and species on sodium and potassium values in the Aldabra tortoise (Geochelone gigantea) and the Burmese mountain tortoise (Manouria emys). Methods: Blood samples from 7 Aldabra tortoises and 8 Burmese mountain tortoises were collected into tubes without anticoagulant and tubes containing lithium heparin. Sodium and potassium concentrations were measured by flame photometry in serum and plasma harvested immediately after collection and from aliquots of whole blood stored at 4degreesC and 25degreesC for 5 to 120 minutes. Results: In Aldabra tortoises, storage time and temperature had no significant effect on potassium concentrations in heparinized blood and in blood without anticoagulant. However, sodium concentrations in serum and plasma decreased significantly in samples without anticoagulant stored at 4degrees C and 25degreesC and in heparinized samples stored at 4degreesC. In Burmese mountain tortoises, potassium concentrations in serum and plasma increased significantly with time in samples without anticoagulant and in heparinized samples stored at 4degreesC and 25degreesC, but the increases were less at 4degreesC. Sodium concentrations in serum and plasma decreased significantly in blood without anticoagulant and heparinized blood stored at 4degreesC and 25degreesC. Conclusions: Storage of blood samples with and without anticoagulant at 4degreesC significantly improved the stability of potassium and sodium concentrations in both species of tortoises. Early separation of red cells from serum or plasma after blood collection is especially important to ensure the reliability of potassium measurements.
