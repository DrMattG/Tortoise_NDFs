AB  - We used 454-sequencing to identify and characterize 32 microsatellite loci for the Western Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni hermanni) for which primer sequences, characteristics, and multiplexes are provided. These markers have been tested for one continental (Var) and one insular (Corsica) French population as well as for the Eastern Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni boettgeri). For these 3 populations, 24 loci were polymorphic. These microsatellite markers will be particularly useful to assess the genetic diversity and characteristics of the different Hermann's tortoise populations and will have direct applications for its protection, notably with respect to reintroduction and conservation programs.

AB  - The isolation and characterization of six polymorphic loci from a Testudo hermanni genomic library is reported. Enrichment was performed for AC but four of the characterized microsatellites present also an additional motif. Variability was tested on populations of the two recognized subspecies, Testudo hermanni hermanni and Testudo hermanni boettgeri. For one locus, a size range specific for the subspecies T. h. hermanni was observed. These are the first primers identified directly in the genome of T. hermanni.

AB  - The Western subspecies of Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni hermanni: WT) is threatened by habitat loss, fragmentation, wildfires, illegal harvesting, and likely hybridization with Testudo hermanni boettgeri (ET), a subspecies introduced from Eastern Europe. To assess the prevalence of this hybridization, we used microsatellite markers and simulations to investigate the genetic status of 565 individuals of the Var district (France) in contrast to the genetic signature of 121 individuals sampled in the Balkans. The genetic differentiation between WT and ET indicated 18% of tortoises in the Var were hybrids between WT and ET (i.e. F1, F2, and F3). Although hybridization increases the genetic diversity within the genetically impoverished WT population, hybridization could also threaten WT genetic integrity. Identifying and removing all hybridized individuals (especially beyond F1) is logistically unfeasible. Instead, conservation actions should reinforce communication and education, notably towards pet owners, to limit further hybridization. Moreover, accurate genetic identification of captives is essential to programs that involve translocating individuals to fragile populations (e.g. those severely impacted by bush fires). Further studies should assess the extent that WT/ET hybridization is detrimental or beneficial to populations facing rapid global changes in the context of depressed genetic diversity.

AB  - We analyzed variation in the distribution of eastern Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni boettgeri) in a complex landscape consisting of both natural and human-altered habitats in a temperate climate region in Serbia. Our results indicated nonrandom distribution of tortoises within different habitat types with large and medium effect size for year and activity pattern, respectively. Additionally, the tortoises expressed relatively weak preference for habitats modified by human activity (e.g., vineyards, orchards, or gardens). The results suggested that these tortoises preferred some particular habitats more than others when performing specific activities. They also did not exhibit the same distribution pattern among habitats over consequent years. In other words, they were not randomly distributed among habitat types with regard to specific activity or year. The information on preferences in complex habitat systems is important for the conservation management of eastern Hermann's tortoise and should be considered when planning activities related to sustainable development within the region of study.

AB  - We identified multiple paternity in 52.9% of the clutches of Hermann's tortoise Testudo hermanni boettgeri using polymorphic microsatellite markers. In addition we demonstrated sperm storage across seasons. DNA was extracted from the amniotic fluid adhering to the eggshell's inner surface, a procedure suitable for easy, non-invasive DNA sampling in conservation and breeding programs. To improve the informative value of monomorphic single tandem repeat (STR) markers we additionally analyzed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variability. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Censuses of population fragments of the Endangered, endemic Hermann's tortoise Testudo hermanni hermanni were carried out during 2001-2005 in mainland France to reassess their status and provide guidelines for conservation management. Comparisons with previous censuses suggest a decline in abundance since 1992, although the total area of distribution remains unchanged. If conservation and management decisions only consider sites where there is a high encounter rate of tortoises, 19 sites would be protected. If indicators of effective reproduction (presence of both sexes, juveniles and subadults) are taken into account, 31 sites would deserve attention, of which only 10 have high encounter rates. Discarding sites with low encounter rates omits c. 70% of sites where the species appears to be reproducing. I provide a new map that includes demographic parameters, and thus describe 16 reproductive fragments plus four where reproduction is suspected. In the long-term the major conservation goal should be to protect these fragments and facilitate their reconnection. The global population of Hermann's tortoise could thus be largely contained in eight large fragments, enhancing the persistence of this species in mainland France.

AB  - Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) is among the conservation priorities in the European Union. Consequently, it is included in Annexes II and IV of the EU Habitats Directive, Annex II of the Bern Convention, and Annex II of the CITES Convention. Hermann's tortoise conservation programs compile insights on the threats affecting population viability, along with factors shaping the species' distribution. Serbian populations of the eastern subspecies (Testudo hermanni boettgeri) seem numerous and therefore prosperous, but recent population viability analyses revealed that they are susceptible to rapid demographic changes and/or habitat destruction. This implies the need for effective population monitoring and protection, as well as mapping and preservation of suitable habitats. In this paper we summarized current knowledge about the geographic distribution of Hermann's tortoise in Serbia and modeled its ecological niche. Our results corroborate and uphold the known species' distribution in Serbia. Most suitable habitats are situated in the lowland areas of eastern, central and southern Serbia, under semi-open habitats, such as pastures and shrubs, broadleaf forests, and all successional stages in between. The results provided in this paper should be considered in the selection and shaping of NATURA 2000 sites in Serbia.

   The morphology of chelonians provides basic information about development, evolution, biodiversity, biomechanics, behavior, ecology, and physiology. Furthermore, it has also played an important role in characterizing populations and analyzing the similarities between populations. This study investigates the morphological variation of Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni boettgeri Mojsisovits, 1889) between specimens from five different populations in Albania. It also provides basic data on the morphological characteristics of the Hermann's tortoise. Hermann's tortoise in the Albanian population were regionally diverged into three different populations that were situated in northern (Shkodra), central (Tirana, Berati, and Ballshi), and southern (Saranda) Albania. Moreover, female individuals were larger and heavier than male individuals, and the females followed Bergmann's rule. The morphological divergences may be due to molecular variations or environmental conditions of the regions.
   Testudines show phenotypic plasticity, and variation among specific populations within a species is widespread. Morphological differences between populations may reflect ecological factors that drive adaptation to local conditions. In this context, we gathered basic data on the morphology of the Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni boettgeri Mojsisovits, 1889) to document their variation across different geographical regions. We surveyed Hermann's tortoises in five different locales within Albania during April and May 2020 and measured 20 morphological characteristics, including carapace and plastron dimensions. We measured 188 tortoises (81 males, 107 females) in this study, and females were larger (p = 0.0001) and heavier (p = 0.0001) than males. Mean straight carapace length (SCL) and body mass were 172.4 mm and 1128.8 g, respectively, for females, and 151.3 mm and 735 g, respectively, for males. The Albanian T. h. boettgeri were regionally diverged into three different populations that were situated in northern (Shkodra), central (Tirana, Berati, and Ballshi), and southern (Saranda) Albania. The body size (curved carapace length (CCL)) of females was positively correlated (r = 0.216; p = 0.025) with the latitude, in accordance with Bergmann's rule. However, there was no correlation between body size and latitude in males. These striking regional differences among Albanian T. h. boettgeri strongly suggest that further study of molecular variations and reproductive output of Hermann's tortoises is warranted.

AB  - Conserving and managing an imperiled species, such as Testudo hermanni, requires information on population status and demographic traits. To acquire this information, we surveyed Hermann's tortoises, Testudo hermanni boettgeri, in European Turkey from April to October 2014-2016. We found 283 (135 males, 102 females, 45 juveniles, and 1 unknown) T. h. boettgeri at 34 locations. Of these sites, 29% included at least 1 individual. We found that females were larger and heavier (mean straight carapace length [SCL] = 175.4 mm, body mass = 1234.1 g) than males (SCL = 153.2 mm, body mass = 849.6 g). The age frequency had a normal Gaussian distribution with 11-15 yrs being the most common. Elevation at capture sites ranged from 22 to 380 m above sea level. Illegal overharvesting for the pet trade appears to have caused no reduction in body size.

AB  - Eastern Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni boettgeri) is a subspecies of Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) found in Albania. Gender determination is one of the crucial elements in determining the population dynamics in all species. Female and male adult tortoises look different, but these differences can be difficult to distinguish in captivity or when their sex indicators are deformed or injured. Therefore, the aim of this study was to use indirect and non-invasive methods such as geometric morphometric analysis to determine the sex of adult tortoises. For the geometric morphometry, 17 female and 23 male Hermann's tortoises were collected and photographed from the hills and mountains around the Tirana district of Albania between August and October 2019. Sexes were discriminated based on geometric morphometry, and plastron shape was a better indicator than carapace shape. In addition, abdominal, femoral and anal scutes on the plastron and the ratio of femoral to pectoral suture lengths were important for the sex distinction. Females had a larger plastron than males; this may have been supported by fecundity selection, because a large plastron suggests more volume in which to store eggs. The femoral and anal scutes were larger in male tortoises, and serve as a stronger base during mating. This study was conducted for adults only, and future studies are needed to determine if these indicators also apply to hatchlings and juveniles.

AB  - Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) is considered near threatened in the wild but, by contrast, it is one of the most popular pet tortoises in Europe. Scant data is reported in the veterinary literature on hematological values for T. hermanni and, to our knowledge, none focused on the subspecies boettgeri (eastern Hermann's tortoise). Published reports are based on small sample populations, and confusion arises when comparing the sampling sites, the anticoagulants, and the counting methods used. The purpose of the current study was to establish the normal mean values and reference intervals for the main hematological parameters for captive adult T. hermanni boettgeri and to evaluate the reliability of a semiautomated blood analyzer for red blood cell count and hematocrit determination. Blood values were determined in 23 adult tortoises using a Neubauer chamber with Natt and Herrick solution; red blood cells and hematocrit were also measured using a semiautomated blood analyzer. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, differences between sexes, and agreement between the counting methods. Reference intervals were calculated with the robust method. Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction was used to investigate differences between sexes, and Bland-Altman analysis was performed to compare manual versus semiautomated values. Red blood cells, hematocrit, and hemoglobin determinations were significantly higher in males than in females. White blood cell counts did not show any sex variability. The agreement of manual versus semiautomated determination was considered acceptable for clinical use.

AB  - Two tortoises with mixed characters between Testudo hermanni boettgeri and T. graeca ibera were discovered during a trip in "Canaraua Fetii Forest" Mixed Nature Reserve (southern Dobrudja, Romania). A hybridization event was suspected. According to external qualitative morphological characters, our preliminary results suggest two morphologically anomalous T. h. boettgeri. The two specimens displayed mostly typical T. h. boettgeri morphological characters, but also anomalous characters, which are typical for T. g. ibera (e.g. the existence of horny spurs on the internal part of the thigh).

AB  - Feeding of Testudo hermanni boettgeri was studied by film analysis and anatomical examination of the musculature and skeleton elements involved. Film sequences were analysed to describe the movements of food item, neck, jaws, and tongue. The feeding cycle is divided into food uptake (ingestion), followed by several transport and manipulation cycles (intraoral transport), and finally swallowing of the food (deglutition). The results show that in Testudo hermanni boettgeri the tongue is the main tool for food uptake and intraoral manipulation. The hyoid apparatus supports the floor of the mouth and is adapted to the highly movable tongue. Compared to aquatic species the hyoid is smaller, more flexible, and less ossified. Skull shape and arrangement of jaw muscles also demonstrate adaptation to terrestrial life. The jaw muscles are less developed, their insertion areas are smaller and do not extend as much caudally as in aquatic species.
   The organisation of the feeding mechanism in tetrapods depends on biophysical constraints imposed by the surrounding medium. In this organisation the hyolingual complex plays an important role. The tongue of terrestrial turtles tends to be larger, more muscular, more mobile, and tends to have a more complex surface than in aquatic forms. The feeding mechanism of Testudo hermanni boettgeri shows the typical situation of a turtle that is fully adjusted to terrestrial life.

AB  - The survival of the tiny native population of the western Hermann's tortoise Testudo hermanni hermanni at the Albera Nature Reserve is threatened by nest predation. The initial purpose of this work was to test the efficacy of a commercial chemical repellent aimed at carnivores in the control of this predation. A total of 128 artificial nests containing quail eggs were distributed among eight 625-m(2) plots. There were four control plots and four plots protected by repellent devices in a natural nesting area of the Albera; each plot contained 16 nests. All the nests, including the protected ones, were depredated after only 4 days. Due to the major role of the wild boar Sus scrofa as predator in this experiment, we decided to assess, by means of a second experiment (n=160 artificial nests, 20 nests/plot), the efficacy of a specific repellent for this mammal combined with the initial repellent. The only noticeable effect of the combination of repellents was to delay predation, although after 4 days almost all protected nests had been depredated. We found both repellents unsatisfactory for reducing nest predation, necessitating the search for other methods of predator control.

AB  - During a screening study to determine the presence of species of the genus Campylobacter in reptiles, three putative strains (RC7, RC11 and RC20(T)) were isolated from different individuals of the western Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni hermanni). Initially, these isolates were characterized as representing Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus by multiplex PCR and partial 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Further whole- genome characterization revealed considerable differences compared to other Campylobacter species. A polyphasic study was then undertaken to determine the exact taxonomic position of the isolates. The three strains were characterized by conventional phenotypic tests and whole genome sequencing. We generated robust phylogenies that showed a distinct clade containing only these strains using the 16S rRNA and atpA genes and a set of 40 universal proteins. Our phylogenetic analysis demonstrates their designation as representing a novel species and this was further confirmed using whole- genome average nucleotide identity within the genus Campylobacter (similar to 80 %). Compared to most Campylobacter species, these strains hydrolysed hippurate, and grew well at 25 degrees C but not at 42 degrees C. Phenotypic and genetic analyses demonstrate that the three Campylobacter strains isolated from the western Hermann's tortoise represent a novel species within the genus Campylobacter, for which the name Campylobacter geochelonis sp. nov. is proposed, with RC20(T) (=DSM 102159(T) =LMG 29375(T)) as the type strain.

AB  - We studied the thermal ecology of Testudo hermanni hermanni in Menorca during late spring. We measured body temperatures of adult individuals, together with air and substrate temperatures at points of capture. Sunlight exposure (full sun, filtered sun, or shade) and type of substrate were also recorded. Body temperatures were similar between sexes (mean = 29.95 degrees C) as were air temperatures between gender capture sites (mean = 28.33 degrees C). Conversely, females were found in areas with a higher substrate temperature (31.60 degrees C) than males were (29.15 degrees C). Moreover, the correlation between body and air temperatures was stronger than it was between body and substrate temperatures, as found in other populations of this species. The tortoises were usually found in full sun, and the proportion of animals found in each sunlight category was similar between sexes. Our results contribute to the knowledge of the thermal ecology of the western Hermann's tortoise.

AB  - Road-associated mortality can lead to local declines of wildlife populations, and management agencies are actively implementing mitigation measures, especially focused on potential road mortality hotspots. In this study we used a spatially-explicit simulation modeling approach to estimate the hotspots of road mortality for the Eastern Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni boettgeri) within its distribution range in Romania. Using a field experiment, we first evaluated velocities while crossing roads. Adult male tortoises moved faster than females (3.98 m/min vs. 2.51 m/min) which led to higher individual probabilities for females being killed on high-traffic roads (0.61 for females vs. 0.44 for males at traffic levels of 7000 vehicles/day). Both males and females had similar road mortality probabilities for traffic levels < 1000 and > 35 000 vehicles/day. Our spatially explicit model suggests that, within the entire Romanian distributional range, the tortoises have an overall risk of road mortality 1.6%, which may have a negative impact on tortoise populations. Using the Getis-Ord Gi statistic, we identified road mortality hotspots with mortality rates of 5-30%, in areas bisected by high-traffic national and European-level roads. Our research is timely in that many low-traffic roads are predicted to have increased traffic associated with tourism activities, thus increasing the overall risk of mortality. We suggest that mitigation measures such as signage and roadside fences associated with underpasses have the potential to limit road mortality of this threatened species within predicted current mortality hotspots.

The main range is located in the Southwestern part of the country, in a sub-optimal sub-Mediterranean climate. Testudo hermanni boettgeri is also found in the Southeastern part of the country, the population there being insignificant to be included in our study. The range from Southwestern part of Romania has a surface of similar to 4420 sq km, from which only similar to 672 sq km is favorable to the tortoise. From the range extension point of view, the Hermann tortoise is a subspecies with a restrictive habitat, and the population is strongly declining-a tendency that most likely will continue in the future. This decline is accentuated by the habitat loss. The main threats for the Hermann tortoise are due to housing and urban area encroachment, tourism and recreation areas, annual and perennial non-timber crops, mining and quarrying, energy production and mining, recreational activities, increase in fire frequency/intensity, droughts, temperature extremes, climate change and severe weather. The threatened status established according to IUCN criteria for the regional level under uncertainty have led to framing the species in the endangered EN Blab(i,ii,iii,v) category.

AB  - Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) is listed as "Near threatened" in the IUCN Red list of endangered species. The importance of protecting the Hermann's tortoise populations and its habitats have led to the inclusion of the species within CITES Convention (Annex II), Annex A of EU Wildlife Trade Regulation, Annex II of the Bern Convention and Annexes II and IV of the EU Habitats Directive. To assess the distribution and status of the eastern Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni boettgeri) in Croatia, historical and recent records were gathered and analyzed. The species was recorded in all three biogeographical regions in the country, but it's native to the Mediterranean and a small part of the Alpine region. With the increase of recent surveys and the use of citizen science platforms, the known range of the species in Croatia was increased by 35.8% and is now encompassing 123 10 x 10 km EEA reference grid cells. Most records (66%) originate from lower elevations (up to 199 m), and the highest was recorded at 570 m. Sparse forests are the most preferred habitats, followed by semi-open habitats, such as grasslands and shrubs. The most serious threat to the species is natural succession due to the increased abandonment of traditional farming and grazing. Other threats include touristic infrastructure and urban development, transportation, illegal collecting, and invasive species. The Area of Occupancy calculated using 2 x 2 km grids resulted in an AOO of 1,372.00 km2, while Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is calculated to be 18,145.07 km2. The current network of National protected areas includes 14% of the species' AOO while the designated Natura 2000 areas include 29.30% of its AOO. We propose to designate an additional 10 Natura 2000 areas to help with the long-term protection of the species.

AB  - Over a period of two years we used radiology to investigate breeding traits in females of two western populations of the threatened Hermann's tortoise Testudo hermanni hermanni. The main purpose of the study was to see if reproductive traits - clutch size, clutch frequency, annual egg production and egg width - varied between populations in Corsica (France) and the Ebro Delta (Spain), and if these traits were affected by female body size and amounts of spring rainfall. All the breeding traits analysed were greater in the Corsican population than in the Ebro Delta population. These differences were also significant when we used female body size as a covariable. In both populations the amount of spring rainfall affected breeding traits but not clutch size. Nevertheless, only in the Corsican population did clutch frequency, annual egg production and egg width increase significantly in the year with a wet spring. Contrary to the predictions of Optimal Propagule Size theory, we found that egg size and clutch size increased with female size, and that both variables were independent. On the other hand, clutch frequency was not related to female body size. Thus, in the Hermann's tortoise, as clutch size did not change between years and clutch frequency was independent of female size, all females are able to increase their reproductive output in years with favourable conditions by increasing their clutch frequency. Nevertheless, other factors besides female size and rainfall may influence in a highly complex way variability in breeding traits among populations.

AB  - Plasma levels of sex steroids in both males and females of the endangered Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni hermanni) were measured throughout their active period in a wild population in the Massif des Maures, France, and in a nearby captive population at Le Village des Tortues in Gonfaron. Both plasma progesterone and testosterone were elevated in males at emergence from winter dormancy, and plasma progesterone levels were significantly higher in wild than in captive males. Plasma testosterone in males then fell to the lowest levels (10 ng ml(-1)) during the nesting season from April to June followed by an elevated plateau during summer, with levels reaching 80 ng ml(-1), presumably concomitant with spermiogenesis. Plasma testosterone increased in all females during autumn, an indication of follicular growth, and remained high on emergence from hibernation, to peak during April, although levels were lower in the captive population. Plasma progesterone also peaked during April and May, presumably related to ovulation, but, again, these changes were less marked in the captive than in the wild females. Measurements of testosterone, progesterone and 17beta-oestradiol in the captive females during their period of oviposition in spring suggested that some females did ovulate and Jay eggs, whereas others did not. Differences in sex steroid levels between captive and wild populations of Hermann's tortoise may indicate a problem with ovulation and/or with stress in a proportion of captive females.

AB  - Although a significant unexploited potential of the geometric morphometrics in taxonomy and systematics has been documented, only a few studies so far have focused on the utility of this method in the detection of population genetic structure in turtles. For the first time, we employed geometric morphometrics to explicitly analyse whether populations possessing divergent haplotypes evolved different patterns of plastral shape in any Testudo species using the Greek populations of Hermann's tortoise as a case study. To molecularly characterize the Greek populations of Testudo hermanni boettgeri used for plastron shape analyses, 12s rRNA gene of tortoises sampled from seven localities in Greece was sequenced. Three divergent haplotypes were observed, regionally corresponding to the north-western (HI), south-western (HII) and Peloponnese (HIII) areas of Greece. In both females and males, haplotypes HI and HII showed the lack of plastral shape divergence, but were both statistically significantly different relative to HIII found in Peloponnese. The Peloponnesian populations (HIII) had longer bridges and the wider and shorter anterior part of the plastron, relative to populations from the mainland Greece (HI and HII). Hence, both morphological and molecular markers suggested Peloponnese as a distinct lineage in relation to mainland populations. Finally, we consider geometric morphometrics as an efficient method to detect and characterize subtle interpopulation differences. Findings in this study have conservation applications as well, implying the presence of cryptic genetic and taxonomic diversity, and, thus, filling the crucial gap in the assessment of the conservation status of T. hermanni.

AB  - Estimating the genetic variation and demographic trends of species in decline is of major concern in conservation genetics. This study contributes to understanding how historical and anthropogenic factors shape the distribution of current genetic diversity in one of the most endangered reptiles in Western Europe, the Hermann's tortoise Testudo hermanni hermanni. We used 17 microsatellite loci, chosen from a pyrosequencing library specifically developed for the subspecies to genotype eight populations distributed over about 30 sample localities covering almost the entire geographic distribution of the sub-species. The population genetic results reflect a very strong genetic structure and identify three major clusters among the Hermann's tortoise in the occidental Mediterranean basin: a continental cluster (Albera in Spain, Var in France and continental Italy), an insular cluster (Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily) and a cluster of mixed lineage (Minorca). Each of the eight studied populations is characterized by only one lineage except for Minorca, in which two lineages were identified. In contrast to what most empirical studies predict, the genetic diversity of the Hermann's tortoise is greater on islands than on the continent. Islands can therefore be considered as genetic sanctuaries with high conservation potential for this species, particularly in Corsica. Historical demographic patterns inferred with a generalized stepwise-mutation model (GSM) using maximum likelihood showed significant past demographic changes in only two of the eight sampled populations: a demographic bottleneck was detected in the Albera population (Spain) and a demographic expansion in Corsica (France). In contrast to what was argued in previous studies, these results indicate that the Hermann's tortoise lineage found in Corsica is autochthonous. The origin of both lineages found in Minorca remains speculative. Lastly, our study identifies the six most relevant management units (sensu Moritz, 1994) for conservation purposes on the basis that they represent a significant part of the evolutionary legacy of the species. Some conservation recommendations were proposed, in particular for the most threatened population in Albera. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The major lipid classes, their fatty acid profiles, and the amounts of the lipid soluble components, vitamin E, vitamin A, and carotenoids, were determined for egg yolks of the Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni boettgeri) with the aim of identifying any features that may potentially impair the adaptation of this endangered species to deteriorations in habitat. Total lipid formed 16% (wt/wt) of the fresh yolk and consisted of (wt/wt) 74.4% triacylglycerol, 18.1% phospholipid, 3.0% cholesteryl ester, and 3.4% free cholesterol. Despite a diet based on green plants, contributing a-linolenic acid as the main polyunsaturate, this fatty acid formed only 3.8% of the total mass of fatty acid of the total lipid. The main acyl component of the yolk lipids was the monounsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid, which formed 45.6% of the total. The most striking feature of the yolk composition was the almost complete lack of two nutrients, docosahexaenoic acid and vitamin A, which are essential for the developing embryo. Although it is feasible that the embryo synthesizes docosahexaenoic acid from yolk-derived a-linolenic acid and also converts yolk-derived p-carotene to vitamin A, the yolk is poorly endowed with both these precursors. The stringencies displayed by the yolk composition in this species may limit the flexibility to adapt to changes in the availability of food items when the habitat is threatened.

AB  - Understanding the movements of animals in the wild is critical for providing important information regarding their conservation and management. With this aim in mind, we studied a population of Testudo hermanni in their natural habitat using micro GPS devices. Additionally, using VHF transmitters we tracked six individuals (four females and two males) from May to August 2015. The overall home range size varied from 813 and 123,567 m(2). Home range size did not differ significantly between males and females, and was also independent of the size of the individual (expressed as straight carapace length). Individual movements were confined to short distances (males 25.7 m; females 18.5 m). Activity levels were highest in July and August for males and May and July for females.

AB  - Although reintroduction programmes are often implemented for recovering animal populations, projects seldom monitor the long-term survival of released animals. In addition, although many releases may occur in the same area, little is known about how the survival of successive release batches is affected by the presence of conspecifics and density dependence. Here, we use multi-state capture-recapture modelling (combining information from recaptures and recoveries) to analyse the survival of two batches of Hermann's tortoise Testudo hermanni hermanni released in a 10-year interval and monitored for 18 years at the Ebro Delta (western Mediterranean). We also tested whether the released animals experienced lower survival (i.e. a release cost) before becoming familiar with the new environment. Although we used a hard-release method, neither group experienced a short-term release cost. Annual survival of both groups differed and was not negatively affected by density-dependent factors. Annual survivorship of the first group of released tortoises was constant and very high (0.945, SE=0.011), and similar to that estimated from several natural populations. The presence of a terrestrial predator in 1 year (before the release of the second group) significantly decreased the survival of tortoises (0.819, SE=0.073). Strikingly, survival of the second batch was significantly lower than that of the first group after the first years of release (0.775, SE=0.049). Although survivorship for the first group suggested that habitat quality was high, the second group seemed not to acclimate well to the new environment, possibly due to the presence of resident tortoises. From a management perspective, reintroduction programmes of the Hermann's tortoise are a successful strategy for its recovery. Nevertheless, it seems advisable to avoid: (1) the release of tortoises at the core of well-established populations and (2) areas with a high density of predators, which can jeopardize the reintroduction success, especially when the number of released individuals is small.

AB  - Phalangeal reduction is a common and widespread phenomenon among tortoises that has been associated with the adaptation to terrestrial life. While reduced manual digit 1 appears characteristic in almost all Testudo species, it is uncertain why the metacarpal I and distal carpal of the same digit are completely missing in some individuals of Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni hermanni). To clarify this issue, we investigated the number of manual claws in six populations of Hermann's tortoise (one from the Ebro Delta in the Iberian Peninsula and five from Minorca Island), their age, sex, genetic lineage, and the substrate type that they inhabit. The number of claws was ascertained based on direct counts (n > 1500 individuals) and by X-rays (n = 32 individuals), obtaining three different phalangeal formulae: (1-2-2-2-1, D-2-2-2-1, 0-2-2-2-1). Thus, claw counts through both methodologies (direct count and X-ray) further confirm that the observed claws serve as a good proxy to assess the actual number of digits. Our results show no loss of phalanges, metacarpal and carpal bones in digit 1 associated with age, sex, or substrate, contrary to some previous authors who hypothesized a relationship between this loss and sexual dimorphism. Therefore, variations in the number of manual digits and the loss of metacarpal I and distal carpal in digit 1 in Hermann's tortoise are related to population and genetic lineage. More detailed comparisons with other Testudo hermanni populations from elsewhere in Europe would be required to understand the evolutionary significance concerning the intrapopulation variability in the number of digits remaining.

AB  - Because they have high longevity and a weak dispersal capacity, chelonians are known to be highly impacted by fire. We investigated the immediate demographic consequences of a wildfire occurring in 2009 on a population of Hermann's tortoises Testudo hermanni in the Plaine des Maures in southeastern France using the multistate capture recapture method. Over two years (2009 and 2010), 108 adult individuals were marked. Survival probability was higher in the unburned (0.99) than in the burned area (0.43). The inter-annual transition probability from the burned to the unburned area was high (0.72). These results show that fire affects survival by immediately killing individuals and by inducing small-scale movements from burned to unburned areas.

AB  - Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni Gmelin) of the Island of Asinara (NW Sardinia, Italy) has been studied during a period of four seasons. This population consisted of several individuals of large body size, some of them being amongst the largest known for this species. Bony shells of males were commonly found on this island, while the same was not true for female bony shells. Although wild boars (Sus scrofa) are potential large sized predators for tortoises, the analysis of carapace morphology did not reveal injuries signs due to bites. Male tortoises could die due to up-turning, as the result of male-male combats during the mating season, to possible hyperthermia when upturned, and to predation carried out by birds particularly when upturned. Estimated density was 4.88 individuals ha(-1), which was similar to that of conspecifics from other areas studied so far.

AB  - Understanding wildlife movements and habitat selection are critical to drafting conservation and management plans. We studied a population of eastern Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni boettgeri) in a traditionally managed rural landscape in Romania, near the northern edge of the species geographic distribution. We used telemetry to radio-track 24 individuals between 2005 and 2008 and performed a Euclidian distance-based habitat selection analysis to investigate habitats preferred by tortoises at both landscapes (second-order order selection) and individual (third-order selection) home range scales. The home range size for tortoises in our study area was 3.79 +/- 0.62 ha and did not differ by gender or season (pre- and post-nesting seasons). Their movement ecology was characterized by short-distance movements (daily mean=31.18 +/- 1.59 m), apparently unaffected by habitat type. In contrast to other studies, movements of males and females were of similar magnitude. At the landscape (population home range) scale, grasslands and shrubs were preferred, but tortoises also showed affinity to forest edges. At the individual home range scale, tortoises selected grassland and shrub habitats, avoided forests, and used forest edges randomly. Creeks were avoided at both spatial scales. Our results suggest that tortoise home ranges contain well-defined associations of habitats despite a higher selection for grasslands. As such, avoiding land conversion to other uses and maintaining habitat heterogeneity through traditional practices (e.g., manual mowing of grasslands, livestock grazing) are critical for the persistence of tortoise populations.

AB  - The annual activity rhythm of the Hermann tortoise (Testudo hermanni hermanni), an endangered species and the only French tortoise, was studied with adults in semi-captivity in the Var. The annual activity rhythm shows two stages: hibernation and activity. During the latter (March-October), above-ground activity is unimodal, except in the summer when it is bimodal with inactivity during very hot periods. Mating occurs during the entire periode of activity with maxima in summer and early autumn. Clutches are laid from mid-May to mid-July, so there is a possibility that females stock spermatoza for some months. During hibernation (November-February), an activity return is possible but not obligatory during the warmest days. The average depth of hibernacula was 6.9 cm.

AB  - The reproductive parameters of the Hermann's Tortoise Testudo hermanni were studied by radiography in Corsica (Porto-Vecchio -island population-) and in Provence (Maures Massif-mainland population-). The following parameters were measured: number of eggs per clutch, clutch frequency, annual fecundity (eggs produced per female per year) and size of the eggs. There was a significantly higher fecundity in the island area, i.e. more eggs per clutch (4 against 3), a higher clutch frequency (1.9 against 1.4) and a global fecundity of 7.7 eggs/female/year as compared to 4.2 eggs/female/year in the mainland area. This increase in fecundity did not change also after taking into account the size of the females, which were larger in the island area. Indea female size does not influence the size of the eggs. The observed increase in fecundity contradicts the theory of the insular syndrome which predicts a decrease in fecundity in insular conditions. This dissension may be the result of the originality of tortoises at the ecophysiological level (long lifetime herbivore species) or may partially depend on distinct local adaptations.

AB  - Macro- and microhabitat preference of Testuda herrnanni boeugeri, the eastern subspecies of Hermann's tortoise, was investigated utilizing modified methodology for the western subspecies which emphasized the importance of habitat heterogeneity preservation. The study objective was to explore the habitat preferences of the eastern subspecies of T. hermanni. Research was conducted within the same year at four localities in Eastern and Southeastern Serbia. Macrohabitat determination was conducted using a 0 to 5 land cover score system (coverage with herbaceous, bushy or tree vegetation) for 4 m(2) tortoise encounter surroundings. Microhabitat analysis was carried out by determining the plant species in closest contact with the tortoise in the moment of recording. Plants were classified into six groups: 1) aromatic, 2) bramble, 3) herbaceous, 4) thorny shrub, 5) tree and 6) non-thorny shrubs. X-2 test was used for comparison between expected and empirical habitat preference. Results confirmed that the most attractive macrohabitats for Eastern Hermann's tortoises in this part of the Balkans are meadows and open shrublands, with the addition of dense forest (important in wormer months), what is concordant with earlier data from the Mediterranean part of former Yugoslavia. The most attractive microhabitats were "herbaceous plants", followed by "bramble".

AB  - We recorded the movements of adult Eastern Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni boettgeri) in a local population situated in a complex forested habitat system. The average total movement range size (TMRS) calculated over three consecutive years was 4.56 ha and 7.53 ha for males and females, respectively. The largest estimated TMRS of male and female tortoises was 27 ha and 90 ha, respectively. Six females and three males (or 9% and 4%, respectively, of the overall sample) had a movement range size (MRS) greater than 10 ha. Significant differences between male and female MRS were not detected. Body size had no influence on the MRS of individuals in the sample, except on the core movement range size (CMRS) in males. Although the collected data did not enable calculation of the home range in the studied population, the results indicate that the calculated average TMRS of local Hermann tortoises is larger than the average home range in some other populations. Therefore, in the absence of information on the home range size of local adult tortoises, the MRS could be a suitable alternative for planning local species reserves.

AB  - In this study, Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni boettgeri) eggs were studied. The aim was to evaluate the basic composition, amino and fatty acid profiles, as well as the presence of certain trace elements in the eggs. The average size of THB eggs was 29.9 x 39.5 mm and weight 20.7 g. The shell accounted for 12.5 %, albumen 46.9 % and yolk 40.6 % of the entire THB egg. The refractive index was 1.3341 in the albumen and 1.5120 in the yolk. The albumen contained 98.2 % water, 0.9 % proteins, 0.7 % ash and traces of fat. The yolk contained 60.6 % water, 21.0 % protein, 14.2 % fat, and 4.0 % ash. The pH of albumen was 8.8. The fatty acid composition was measured in egg yolk; oleic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid and, vaccenic acid were the most abundant. The amino acid composition was measured in egg albumen, and 18 amino acids were detected. The major amino acids present in albumen were glutamic acid, aspartic acid, leucine, phenylalanine, lysine, glycine, serine, threonine, and alanine. Concentrations of the trace elements, in descending order were in the shell: iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), zinc (Zn), chromium (Cr), arsenic (As) and selenium (Se); in the albumen: Fe, Cu, Cr, Se; and in the yolk: Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, Se, Cr, Ni, Pb, Co.
   The purpose was to determine the chemical composition the of eggs, which can be used as a basic study for further comparison with free-living tortoises, and also as a comparison for the possible impact of environmental pollution.

AB  - In general, fires and traffic impose serious threats to wildlife. Chelonians are also gravely affected by these two perils, both directly (many die in fires and on the roads) and indirectly (due to habitat fragmentation and degradation). In the Hermann's tortoise population subjected to capture-mark-recapture (CMR) study we analysed the impacts of fires and road kills. We found that the most vulnerable to both perils were the immatures and adult females, with most fatalities in summer. During the course of our research, along with the reconstruction and widening of a motorway, a rockslide-protective wire mesh was fixed along one section of the road under study. It reduced the number of road kills, but it also acted as a deadly trap for some of the tortoises trying to escape the fast-spreading fire. Here we presented the results of a short survey: in future more time and effort need to be devoted to the given population and its conservation needs.

AB  - Honest-advertisement models of sexual selection suggest that condition-dependent male secondary sexual characters could function as reliable signals of male quality, enabling females to discriminate among potential partners, both in the pre- and post-copulatory phases. In this context, many studies have revealed the importance of promiscuous mating systems and female sperm storage in determining the occurrence of such a model of sexual selection. By contrast, few studies have investigated the presence and extent of post-copulatory female choice in chelonian species. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of male size, male-male competition, and courtship intensity on paternity distribution in Testudo hermanni hermanni, combining behavioural and genetic data. We created experimental groups composed of two males of different sizes and three or four randomly selected females. Observations conducted during social interactions between males revealed that a hierarchy, unrelated to male size, was soon established: Alpha males were more aggressive towards competitors and courted females more intensively. Alpha males also achieved a higher mounting success than Beta males. Paternity analysis performed on hatchlings produced from experimental females revealed that male reproductive success was not correlated with male-female size ratio. Finally, despite the higher mounting success of Alpha males, paternity analysis revealed that male reproductive success did not differ between Alpha and Beta males.

AB  - Herbivory is the dominant feeding strategy in tortoises, and dietary shifts are common in response to changes in resource availability. We conducted the first large-scale study of the diets of wild Hermann's Tortoises (Testudo hermanni hermanni) and found that the study population in central Italy was strictly herbivorous. The tortoises ate primarily legume leaves and grasses in the spring, and switched to flowers and unripe fruit of Ruscus aculeatus as these became available in the autumn. There were no significant differences between the diets of males and females. Although tortoise diets included both rare and abundant plant species, they consumed abundant plant species in a higher proportion than those species occurred in the study area. However, some rare plants made up relatively large fractions of the diet, and one of the few nonnative plants (Conyza canadensis) at the study area was eaten frequently by tortoises in all seasons, despite its relative rarity. Ruscus aculeatus berries may be particularly valuable to tortoises that are about to enter hibernation; hence. T. hermanni habitat should be managed to maintain this important plant species.

AB  - Testudo hermanni hermanni is becoming seriously endangered throughout its range. It has a scattered distribution, with a small number of residual populations found in Spain, France and Italy. In this study we sampled a population of T. h. hermanni from Southern Tuscany (Massa Marittima, Grosseto), composed of native and introduced individuals (recognizable due to residual signs of previous marking on the carapace). Overall, 95% of the captured individuals were adults and the sex ratio was slightly, but not significantly, biased in favour of females. Population density was relatively high in comparison with other Italian populations, although it was doubled by previous reinforcement. Genetic analysis performed on six polymorphic microsatellite loci revealed a high level of genetic variability and heterozygosity, with no evidence of current inbreeding processes. Moreover, introduced individuals presented genotypes similar to those of the native individuals, thus suggesting that the reinforcement intervention did not cause a significant change in the original genetic pool. Nevertheless, long-term monitoring of the population is necessary to ensure its stability and vitality. Furthermore, to preserve the genetic identity of the local population in the future, uncontrolled translocation events should be avoided.

AB  - Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) is widely distributed in western and southern Europe. Most populations in the western part of the distribution range (e.g. Spain, France, Italy) are severely reduced, and relatively well studied, whilst the species is still abundant in eastern areas (i.e. the Balkans). However, essential biological information (e.g. main morphological, ecological, and behavioural characteristics) for the Balkans are still extremely limited. As reptiles exhibit strong geographic variation in most morphological, as well as life history traits, gathering data from distant areas is important. We present data from two populations of T hermanni in Serbia, focusing on sexual dimorphism in body size and body shape. We found that almost all of the 43 morphological traits analysed were significantly different between sexes and that sexual size and sexual shape dimorphisms were not expressed in similar ways. Notably, sexual size dimorphism (SSD) was more pronounced than sexual shape dimorphism (SShD). Our analyses suggested that SShD is more stable than SSD, and that the scale of the focus (i.e. whole body proportions versus morphological details) is a key factor to test this notion. When general measurements were considered, the expected consistency of SShD between populations was verified; nevertheless, when more specific morphological attributes were considered, substantial variations were observed. These results provide a baseline for comparisons between populations to further examine geographic variation of sexual dimorphism.

AB  - Survival, reproductive and recruitment rates, along with health status, of translocated and resident individuals should be evaluated. However, gathering this information poses logistical constraints and requires long-term studies. Considering the urgent nature of many species' situations where translocation would be appropriate, fast-assessment techniques should be tested. We assessed the immediate response to translocation of Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni hermanni) directly from captivity to the wild. Individuals were maintained in captivity 2 to 8 years before being released in spring 2013 into a natural population impacted by fire. During the critical 3 months post-release period, we radio-tracked translocated individuals (N = 12) and resident tortoises in spring 2013 (N = 14), plus another batch of resident tortoises in spring 2012 (N = 9). Movements, behaviours, body condition and body temperature were regularly recorded. All translocated tortoises acclimated well to their novel environment. We found no differences in movement, thermoregulation and body condition between translocated and resident tortoises. Body condition of all tortoises increased rapidly in spring. We found no sign of perturbation in resident tortoises. Contrarily, resident males mated with translocated females. Translocations should be further tested on larger spatial and time scales to improve population restoration programmes, especially in threatened species with limited dispersal ability.

AB  - Most species of tortoises are seriously threatened worldwide. Chelonians are long-lived organisms characterized by slow demographic traits; mathematical modeling estimated that a high rate of juvenile annual survival (i.e. > 0.6 on average) is essential for the persistence of populations. Unfortunately, current knowledge about free-ranging juveniles is fragmentary. Under field conditions, young tortoises are very secretive, they remain sheltered beneath bushes, and they escape capture. The resulting lack of information impairs the assessment of key parameters such as juvenile survival, habitat use, or recruitment rate and thus seriously impedes both accurate population viability analyses and conservation planning. Large-scale monitoring of different populations of a threatened species (Testudo hermanni hermanni) confirmed that juveniles are rarely seen in the field. In 2011, we placed corrugated fibrocement slabs as alternative refuges for small tortoises in a densely vegetated study site. Many juveniles sheltered under the space offered by the corrugations; consequently they were easily captured and recaptured. Our results suggest that this simple technique may significantly improve the detectability of juveniles, providing access to the life history traits of this otherwise elusive age cohort. The slabs also provide protection against predators (such as dogs and birds) which further suggests that these refuges may also improve the survival of the smallest and most vulnerable individuals.

AB  - Habitat destruction has resulted in the fragmented distribution of numerous terrestrial species, which poses a challenge for conservationists. Furthermore, species management can be further compounded by life history constraints such as low dispersal, hindering the ability of species to recolonize areas they formerly occupied. For these species, a thorough understanding of the local threats and factors that limit their distribution is crucial for effective management. We used occupancy models to examine which factors at landscape and habitat scales (i.e. land uses, fire history, and vegetation structure) explain the presence of terrestrial tortoises within the range of the westernmost isolated population of the endangered Testudo hermanni hermanni in the Albera Range (NE of the Iberian Peninsula). We randomly surveyed 25 sites (75% of the area known with presence of tortoises) of natural woodlands with 5 to 8 replicates per site in spring 2012-2014. From a sampling effort of 148 hours, we only detected 52 tortoises in 12 of 25 transects. These low numbers are evidence of low population densities. Sites with presence of tortoises were spatially aggregated although the species was absent from apparently adequate sites on the edges of its distribution range. Current and historic land-use primarily explained the presence of tortoises. Besides, wildfires and reduction of habitat complexity also participate to explain the distribution of Hermann's tortoises. We also discuss some aspects of the conservation of Testudo hermanni in relation to our results.

AB  - We used geometric morphometric analysis to investigate latitudinal variation in size and shape of carapace and plastron of I I I Testudo hermanni hermanni (60 males and 51 females) collected in 6 different Italian regions. Basing on a sample of 14 landmarks for carapace and 18 landmarks for plastron, we showed that the size and shape of both sexes changed according to a North-South cline following the Bergmann's rule, tortoises of Northern Italy being 1.1-1.2 larger than that of Southern Italy. Shape variation was higher in carapace probably because sexual selection in this species acts stronger on plastron than on carapace shape.

AB  - Nest predation has been identified as the main threat behind the negative population dynamics in chelonian species and in particular in the native Iberian population of the Western Hermann's tortoise Testudo hermanni hermanni. This endangered subspecies is found within the Albera Nature Reserve, where this study was performed. We selected three formerly high-density tortoise areas to carry out different trials whose aims were to: (1) identify nest predator species, (2) test the success of reducing the shrub cover to reduce nest predation in potential new nesting areas, and (3) assess fencing efficiency to exclude predators. For the first objective, camera-trapping was used to identify nest predators, with sardines and artificial tortoise nests as lures. We obtained 825 pictures of possible predators and demonstrated that the beech marten was the most abundant predator in the study areas, followed by the badger and the wild boar. For the second objective, predation of artificial nests was compared between plots managed for shrub reduction (27 plots of 4, 25, and 100 m(2)) and a natural nesting area (nine control plots of 100 m(2)). Predation was strong in the managed plots (43.6% after 48 h and 99.6% after 144 h) but highest in the control area (100% after 48 h). Surprisingly, predation occurred at an even faster pace when we repeated the trial with a single artificial nest (in order to reduce odor intensity). Finally, we compared predation rates between eight fenced and eight unfenced plots of 100 m(2). Fencing was partially effective to control nest predation because it excluded all the main predator species except the beech marten, which learned to go through it. Since the nest predation threat to this endangered population is critical, new strategies are needed to control nest predation by taking into account the ability of predators to learn nest location.

AB  - Sperm storage is widespread in many vertebrate groups, and it is frequently associated with promiscuous mating systems. Chelonian species are one of the most outstanding examples of a promiscuous group capable of long-term sperm storage; specialized structures have evolved within the oviducts of these vertebrates to ensure sperm vitality across reproductive cycles. Thus far, few studies have investigated the factors regulating multiple paternity, sperm usage by females and paternity distribution in successive clutches. This study aimed to investigate the effect of mating order on male mounting and reproductive success in Testudo hermanni hermanni, combining behavioural and genetic data. A series of planned matings were performed, within which experimental females were mated sequentially to two different males under controlled conditions. Observations conducted during experimental matings revealed that courtship displays did not significantly differ between the first and second males to mate with a female. Interactions ending with a mount were characterized by a significantly higher intensity and occurrence of determinate courtship behaviours, for example biting and running after the female. Paternity analysis performed on hatchlings produced from experimental females revealed that 46 % of the clutches were multi-sired. A significant contribution of previous years' partners was still found, thus confirming the long-term sperm storage within the female oviduct in this species. Finally, mating order did not significantly affect the reproductive success of experimental males during the on-going reproductive season.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the percentage of hatched and fertilized eggs in female Hermann's tortoises before and after the removal of males after breeding.
   A breeding group of Testudo hermanni boettgeri with 50 females and 12 males was included in the study. In the first year, all adults were together in the same habitat until reproductive activity was observed. After the end of May, the males and females were separated for the next two active seasons. The number of eggs and number of second clutches decreased gradually. In the first year, 76.0% of females laid eggs; in the second year, 24.0%; and in the third year, only 8.0%. Second clutches were observed in ten females (26.3%) in the first year, while in the next two years, one female had a second clutch. There was a small but significant correlation between the weight of a single tortoise and the number of eggs laid but no significant correlation between the weight of the tortoise and its average egg weight. The weight (15.1-16.8 g), length (33.9-36.1 mm) and width of each egg (27.5-28.0 mm) was measured.
   During the laying season, the eggs were put into incubators. The incubation length varied from 52 to 70 days. After the end of incubation, eggshell mortality and its causes (19.3-52.5%) were examined. In the first year, the viability rate of the incubated eggs was 80.7%; in the second year, 80.5%; and in the third year, 47.8%. Among the unhatched eggs in the first year, 62.5% were unfertilized, 53.1% were infected, 28.1% were dehydrated and 21.9% were found in various stages of embryonic development.

AB  - A 12SrRNA mitochondrial fragment was sequenced in 47 Testudo hermanni individuals from three different populations in northeastern Italy, Sicily, and Spain. All these locations fall within the distribution range usually recognized for the T. h. hermanni subspecies. Seven different sequences were identified, which clearly separate the highly variable northern Italian group from the homogenous individuals in Sicily and Spain. More interestingly, almost all the northern individuals had a DNA sequence identical or very similar to three sequences belonging to individuals from the Balkans and Greece, and morphologically classified as T. h. boettgeri.

AB  - A twelve-year-old, female Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) was presented with an oviductal prolapse after showing tenesmus for three days prior to presentation. Radiography revealed a soft tissue opacity in the caudal coelomic cavity that ultrasonographically presented as a congested, invaginated tubular structure and was deemed to comprise the left oviduct. After repositioning the oviductal prolapse, coelioscopy confirmed that the invaginated structure consisted of the anterior part of the left oviduct and incorporated a part of the ipsilateral mesovarium and mesosalpinx. A transplastron osteotomy was carried out to perform unilateral salpingectomy and bilateral ovariectomy. A definitive diagnosis of an oviductal leiomyoma was made based on histopathological and immunohistochemical examination of the invaginated part of the oviduct. In the present case, the authors highlight that neoplastic disorders should be considered as a cause of oviductal invagination and prolapse in chelonians. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of the diagnosis and successful treatment of an oviductal leiomyoma in a Hermann's tortoise.

AB  - Herman's tortoise, Testudo h. hermanni, is an endangered subspecies in Italy, France, and Spain. We studied a Herman's tortoise population in the Riserva Naturale Regionale Monterano in the Tolfa Mountains of central Italy. We found that, unlike most other studies of this and related species, sex ratios were 1:1, and half the population was made up of juveniles. Sexual maturity was reached at 12 years in males and 12-13 years in females, and females were significantly larger. Tortoises greatly preferred open maquis habitat over other habitat types and thermoregulated so that body temperatures stayed consistently above ambient temperatures, especially under low ambient temperature conditions. Presence of ticks was significantly associated with an index of thermoregulatory behavior. We suggest that maintenance of open maquis habitat in this reserve is essential to high hatchling production and effective thermoregulation.

AB  - The published cytb mtDNA sequences from a previous phylogeographic study of Testudo hermanni and de novo genetic and phenotypic data of samples from the Pcinja River Valley (Serbia, Central Balkans) and Trebinje (Bosnia and Herzegovina) were used to: (i) genetically characterize samples from Pcinja, a region of great importance from the conservation standpoint due to its taxonomic diversity and biogeographical history, and Trebinje, a type locality of a disputed taxon "Testudo hercegoviensis" Werner, 1899; (ii) to study the link between gene genealogy and geographic distribution by implementing spatial genetic analyses, and (iii) to assess whether the distribution of carapace shape variation is in accordance with genetic clusters. The samples from Pcinja and Trebinje possessed divergent haplotypes that corresponded to east (HI) and west (HV) genetic clusters, respectively. Geometric morphometrics was found to be a suitable method to distinguish divergent genetic clusters, arguing for the reassessment of a subspecific ranking within the currently recognized eastern Hermann's subspecies, T. h. boettgeri.

AB  - Two tortoises, Testudo graeca ibera Pallas, 1814 and Testudo hermanni boettgeri (Mojsisovics, 1889), inhabit Bulgaria. Certain features normally used for their identification, such as division of the supracaudal scute (divided in T. h. boettgeri; undivided in T. g. ibera), are not absolute. Seven whole shells of T. g. ibera and eleven of T. h. boettgeri were studied, and also a large series of shell fragments of both species. Based on analysis of 44 shell characters, T. h. boettgeri was distinguished by the following: maximal width of vertebral scute V clearly greater than maximal widths of other vertebral scutes; width of vertebral scutes II, III and IV smaller than width of pleural scutes I, II and III; medial length of pectoral scute equal or slightly greater than half the medial length of the hypoplastron; hypo-xiphiplastral suture distant from the corner of the inguinal notch; medial length of xiphiplastron less than maximal width (in females), or nearly half the maximal width (in males).

AB  - A lack of long-term monitoring often impedes the evaluation of translocation used to reinforce populations. Crucial questions regarding the exact timing and place of possible settlement remain unanswered. To examine these issues we radio-tracked during three years 24 tortoises (Testudo hermanni hermanni) released to reinforce a resident population impacted by fire. Individuals from the resident population (N = 20) and from a distant control population (N = 11) were also radio-tracked. More than 11,000 fixes were collected, enabling us to precisely describe movement patterns. Most translocated tortoises first dispersed (> 500 m to > 3000 m away) in a random direction and sometimes crossed unfavorable areas. Later, a marked shift in movement pattern, from a relatively unidirectional course to multidirectional displacements indicated settlement. Movement patterns of translocated and resident individuals became undistinguishable after settlement. Most individuals settled during the first year after release but several settled in the second year. Mean annual survival rate (> 85%) remained within the range of the species but was lower compared to the resident (93%) and control tortoises (100%). Overall, most translocated individuals (similar to 63%) settled and adapted well to their novel environment. This result is essential regarding current controversies that are unfounded and that limit conservation translocations. Yet, translocation sites should be large enough and/or surrounded by secondary favorable areas to limit the mortality associated with dispersal in hazardous environments. Large numbers of individuals rescued during urbanization works may easily supply conservation translocations to reinforce fragile populations.

AB  - Microsporidia are obligate intracellular, spore-forming fungi. A wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate hosts can be infected; however, cases of infected turtles or tortoises have not yet been described. This is the first description of 4 cases in tortoises (Testudo spp), which showed general signs of illness as well as intestinal and respiratory signs until death occurred or they were euthanized. Granulomatous and necrotizing inflammation was visible in the lung and liver. Fungal organisms were present in heart blood, lung, liver, and intestine. Because of their morphology, staining properties (eg, positive in periodic acid-Schiff and silver reaction), and electron microscopic appearance, they were classified as microsporidia.

AB  - An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for the detection of antibodies to a herpesvirus associated with an upper respiratory tract disease in Mediterranean tortoises [spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) and Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni)]. This serodiagnostic test was validated through a hyperimmunization study. The mean of the A(405) readings of the plasma samples collected at time zero of the hyperimmunization study plus three times the standard deviation was used as the cutoff for seropositivity in tortoises. ELISA results were compared to serum neutralization (SN) values for the same samples by using the McNemar test. The results obtained by SN and ELISA were not significantly different (P>0.05). This new ELISA could be used as an important diagnostic tool for screening wild populations and private and zoo collections of Mediterranean tortoises.

AB  - Neoplastic disorders are frequently encountered in the practice of reptile medicine. Herein we report the clinical behavior, antemortem diagnosis, and histopathologic characteristics of a recurrent intraoral keratinizing basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and a metastatic BCC of the carapace in 2 Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni). Although squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) in tortoises show similar predilection sites and gross pathologic features, the BCCs described in our report were characterized by a remarkably fast and highly infiltrative growth in comparison to SCCs. Accordingly, early diagnosis including reliable discrimination from SCC is essential toward the management of this neoplastic entity in tortoises.

AB  - Abnormalities and the postnatal development of the carapace were investigated in 106 captive tortoises (Testudini-dae, Testudo hermanni boettgeri, Testudo graeca, Testudo marginata, Testudo horsfieldii) using computer tomography (CT) in live animals and/or dissection of preserved specimens. The carapace was reconstructed two-dimensionally through combining sectional images. The postnatal ossification was demonstrated in 3D CT images combined with dissection results. We found that abnormal numbers and arrangements of horny scutes and bony plates may occur independently at different locations and different ontogenetic stages. Abnormalities of the horny scutes are present at hatching when the bony plates are not yet fully formed. The temporal course of carapace ossification appears to be species-specific. We demonstrate that computer tomography is a non-invasive and convenient method suitable for studying abnormalities and the postnatal ossification process of the bony carapace, as well as for diagnostics in live chelonians. However, the resolution limit of the method will be reached in the case of very young or metabolically challenged subjects.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to estimate the level of hard tick infestation in the tortoise subspecies Testudo hermanni boettgeri living within the free-range hills and mountains of four regions of central and south Albania. In addition, this study showed the morphological differences of infested and non-infested tortoises in several geographic locations where tortoises are known to be infested with Hyalomma aegyptium, a natural carrier of different zoonotic pathogens. Thirty-six of 145 (24.8%) examined Hermann's tortoises were found to be infested with hard ticks. After the tortoises were carefully captured and controlled, a total of 67 H. aegyptium were collected: 47 in Berati, 11 in Ballshi and 9 in Saranda. None of the 40 tortoises in the Tirana region were found to be infested with ticks. All ticks were identified as H. aegyptium adults. The highest prevalence of tick infestation was in the Berati region at 49.1%, followed by the Ballshi and Saranda region by 24% and 12%, respectively. The mean infestation intensity was 1.86 H. aegyptium per Hermann's tortoise, and it was found that H. aegyptium are less common in large Hermann's tortoises. The number of H. aegyptium male ticks was negatively correlated with the body dimensions of Hermann's tortoises. Hyalomma aegyptium is the most prevalent tick in Hermann's tortoises in three regions of south Albania, and with a typical three-host life cycle in different wild and domestic animals, they may be a vector of zoonotic pathogens. Furthermore, other studies should be conducted to detect the presence of zoonotic pathogens in ticks from these regions and to estimate the risk of transmission in animals and humans.

AB  - We used radiography over two breeding seasons to investigate female reproductive phenology in a Corsican population of Hermann's tortoise. Wild females were kept in semi-captivity in similar conditions to the wild. The main purpose of the study was to determine the length of the breeding season for each female, the laying period, and the approximate length of the inter-clutch interval and clutch retention time. Clutches were laid only in May and June, and in both years the monthly proportions were similar. In 1998 the length of the breeding season (mean +/- SE = 44.7 +/- 3.3 days) was greater than in 1999 (33.1 +/- 2.6 days), but we found no annual differences in the date of first and second clutches. There were no differences in the inter-clutch interval between individual females or between years. Clutch retention time varied among clutches of the same year, but not between years for the same clutch order. When considering the order in which the clutches were laid, we observed that the first clutches were concentrated in May, whereas the second and third clutches were concentrated in June. In both years, only the females that laid their first clutches in May were able to lay a second or even a third clutch in June. Bigger females tended to lay first clutches earlier in the breeding season than did the smaller ones. The differences observed in the length of the breeding season between years may be explained by the annual differences in the frequency of females that produced one, two or three clutches, since we found no annual differences in the date of first and second clutches, in the inter-clutch interval or in the clutch retention time (for the same order of clutches).

AB  - We processed 40 morphological characteristics of 676 adult Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) (310 males and 366 females) from four localities in the central parts of the Balkan Peninsula. Analyses of variance and covariance showed significant differences between males and females in 38 and 35 traits, respectively. On the other hand, analyses of geographic variability within each gender, i.e. analyses of variance and covariance of separate traits between localities showed "constant" dimensions and proportions of several body parts. Most of the invariable traits were the elements of the rear portion of the tortoises' shell and free body parts, in both genders. Among these are some of the most prominent sexually dimorphic traits in T hermanni. Therefore, we speculate that "standard" sizes of certain superficial bodily attributes in this species are conditioned by their role in gender discrimination, as well as courting and mating endeavours.

AB  - Variation in a number of morphological characters were analysed in five populations of Testudo hermanni from Serbia and Montenegro. Tortoises from Serbia appeared significantly larger than those from Montenegro. An insular population of Montenegro was distinct due to its extremely small body size and mass and dark plastral pigmentation. Although the majority of tortoises had the supracaudal scute divided, many tortoises had the scute undivided. Effects of possible genetic divergence and/or adaptation to different environmental conditions on observed morphological variation were discussed.

AB  - Background: Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) is a near threatened species found throughout southern Europe. Captive breeding of endangered species is subject to health risks, such as the stress of captivity and ambient conditions that may favor the emergence of infectious diseases. An episode of systemic atypical mycobacteriosis was investigated in six Hermann's tortoises from a captive population. The symptoms appeared in the form of anorexia, weakness, and lethargy, with inflammatory and edematous lesions of the hind limbs and tail. Four of the affected tortoises were euthanized and necropsied. Methods: Blood samples and joint aspirates were obtained for assessment. Euthanasia of four affected animals was performed. Postmortem examination included necropsy, histopathology, and mycobacterium detection by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In the other two animals, only hematology and blood biochemistry was carried out. Results: Hematological and blood biochemistry analyses gave inconsistent results. In joint aspirates, mononuclear cells with phagocytozed bacillary structures were observed. Ziehl-Neelsen stain revealed the presence of acid-fast bacteria. Granulomatous lesions were observed in liver, lungs, spleen, heart, muscle, kidney, and ovaries. Culture and identification were positive for mycobacteria and molecular sequencing led to the identification of Mycobacterium nonchromogenicum. Conclusions and clinical relevance: Although mycobacteriosis is rare in reptile collections, strict hygienic and prophylactic measures in species of high ecological value must be performed, especially if the animals are to be used for reintroduction projects.

AB  - Based on the critical review of the literature published in the last 22 years, an attempt was made to evaluate the current knowledge gap on the distribution and status of the native Testudines taxa occurring in Sicily (namely Caretta caretta, Emys trinacris, and Testudo hermanni hermanni), as well as the available knowledge of the only non-native species with putative viable populations occurring on the island, i.e., Trachemys scripta. Summarizing the current information, all of the Testudines species occurring in Sicily showed a fragmented and incompletely-known distribution, and only scarce data are available about their phenology. Moreover, despite their inclusion of international and national laws (Bern Convention, CITES, Habitat directive), all three native species are facing several threats (e.g., habitat alteration, the occurrence of invasive species, parasite spillover) leading to a reduction of their populations on the island. Future monitoring programs on the island should be enhanced, with an emphasis on those taxa in decline. Moreover, involve Citizen Science programs should also be implemented in order to increase the awareness of non-experts and facilitate the monitoring task.

AB  - Intranuclear coccidiosis of tortoises (TINC) has been described in association with systemic disease in various species of tortoises. TINC has been detected in numerous tortoises from the United States, but there are only a few reports from tropical tortoises in Germany and no reports from Asia. Using a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, samples from 1,011 tortoises were screened for the presence of TINC. Samples originated from animals kept in captivity in Europe and in China. Coccidia were detected in a total of 27 chelonians (2.7%), including the first description of TINC in a marginated tortoise (Testudo marginata), Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni), African spurred tortoise (Centrochelys sulcata), and yellow-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis denticulatus). The highest percentage of positive animals was found in radiated tortoises (Astrochelys radiata). Although the percentage of positive animals was relatively low, this study demonstrates the global distribution of TINC in captive chelonians as well as expanding the known host range for these pathogens.

AB  - We studied reproductive characters of a population of the tortoise Testudo h. hermanni in the Plaine des Maures (Var), and compared these to another population in southern France and to T. h. boettgeri in Greece. Clutch characters, which are measures of total reproductive investment, showed no differences between subspecies or sites after body size correction by ANCOVA. Egg characters, which measure the division of this investment among offspring, did vary significantly among both subspecies and sites after correcting for body mass. The presence of such local variation should discourage relocation of the threatened T h. hermanni even between populations of the same subspecies.

AB  - The Hermann's tortoise is a strictly European species found mostly in areas with Mediterranean and sub-Mediterranean climes and, especially the subspecies T. hermanni hermanni, has to deal with various threats which reduced its geographic distribution to only a few isolated populations. Thus, with the objective of recovering natural populations of the species, numerous reintroduction projects are being carried out throughout its historical and prehistorical geographic distribution. The aim of our study is to evaluate the success of the T. hermanni reintroduction project carried out in the Albufera de Valencia Natural Park since 2011, through the analysis of movements, home range sizes and habitat use in a new environment. The recorded activity pattern presents two peaks, one in spring and another in August, and the hibernation period (from December to February) is the same as observed in other populations. We did not find significant differences in home range sizes between sexes, but a tight relation between home range sizes and body sizes with larger individuals having larger home ranges. This relation was not observed for core areas (Kernel at 50%). Considering the habitat use, we did not find differences between the groups of individuals we defined, but different types of habitats were used differently. "Scrub" was the most frequented (similar to 50%), followed by "dunes" (similar to 20%), "mallaes" (similar to 20%) and "forest" (<20%). Our results can be used to improve the success of future reintroduction projects by directing ideal habitat, timing and carapace size of released Hermann's tortoises.

AB  - In Mediterranean regions, fires threaten terrestrial tortoises. Nevertheless, varying proportions of adults survive fire; these surviving individuals can play a central role for population recovery. The regions devastated by fire often include important habitat of Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni hermanni), so assessing the ability of survivors to persist is essential for conserving the species. Body-condition indices provide an integrative estimate of how well individuals cope with environmental variations and impacts, including fires. Between 2002 and 2009, we monitored Hermann's tortoises in intact and burnt habitats in southeastern France. In summer 2003, a strong fire ravaged half of the surveyed zone, providing an opportunity to compare body condition of tortoises between intact and burnt areas over time. Six years later, the impact of fire on vegetation was still marked; large trees were abundant in the intact area, whereas open shrub vegetation prevailed in the burnt area. In both areas, the mean body condition of tortoises fluctuated over time; however, there were no differences between the two areas. A radio-tracking experiment demonstrated that individuals from each area were residents, and not vagrants commuting between areas. We also assessed changes in body condition and microhabitat use in radio-tracked individuals. We found no significant differences between the tortoises living in the burnt and intact areas, despite subtle differences in habitat use. In conclusion: (i) surviving tortoises in an area ravaged by fire can maintain their body condition like individuals living in an intact area, and thus, individuals from burnt areas should not be translocated to supposedly better areas; and (ii) depopulated burnt areas are likely to be appropriate for population-augmentation programmes.

AB  - Testudo hermanni is included as near-threatened in the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, while T. hermanni hermanni is considered endangered in the Italian Red List. Appropriate management of smuggled or seized wild individuals is recommended before their reintroduction into the wild. Accordingly, a health monitoring study was carried out. During 2014-2016, 133 oral swabs and 121 cloacal swabs were collected from a total of approximately 180 free-ranging and rescued T. hermanni hermanni from eight different Italian regions to investigate the presence of DNA of Testudinid alphaherpesvirus (TeAHV), Chlamydia spp. and Mycoplasma spp. in the oral cavity, and Salmonella spp. isolates in the cloaca. Mycoplasma spp. was detected in 52 out of 87 (59.77%) of rescued and in 1 out of 46 free-ranging (2.17%) individuals; 33 out of 53 (62.26%) Mycoplasma spp. positive samples were typed as M. agassizii by PCR. Salmonella spp. was isolated from 45 out of 121 (37.19%) cloacal swabs, typed into 14 serovars, and characterized for complete antimicrobial susceptibility. A significantly different distribution of Salmonella spp. isolates was found in 2016 in comparison with 2014 and 2015, without any difference between free-ranging and rescued tortoises. All the tested tortoises were negative for TeAHV and Chlamydia spp. These results are considered a baseline information critical to monitor the dynamics of these microorganisms in free-ranging and rescued populations of T. h. hermanni, and to correctly approach the management of rescued animals and possible relocation programs.

AB  - Background Hotspots of intraspecific genetic diversity represent invaluable resources for species to cope with environmental changes, and their identification is increasingly recognized as a major goal of conservation ecology research. However, even for iconic and endangered species, conservation strategies are often planned without thorough information on the geographic patterns of genetic variation. Here, we investigated the spatial patterns of genetic variation of the endangered Hermann's tortoise Testudo hermanni in the Italian Peninsula by genotyping 174 individuals at 7 microsatellite loci, with the aim to contribute to planning effective conservation strategies. Results Ordination-based and Bayesian clustering analyses consistently identified three main genetic clusters, one spread in the central and northern part of the peninsula, and two restricted to southern Italy and Sicily, respectively. The highest levels of genetic diversity were found in populations of the southern cluster and, in particular, at the northern edges of its distribution (He > 0.6, Ar > 2.8 ), that correspond to areas of putative secondary contact and admixture between distinct lineages. Our results clearly identify a hotspot of genetic diversity for the Hermann's tortoise in southern Italy. Conclusion We inferred the evolutionary history and the spatial patterns of genetic variation of the Hermann's tortoise in the Italian Peninsula. We identified three main genetic clusters along the peninsula and a hotspot of intraspecific diversity in southern Italy. Our results underline the urgent need for conservation actions to warrant the long-term persistence of viable tortoise populations in this area. Furthrmore, these data add further evidence to the role of southern Italy as a biodiversity hotspot for temperate fauna, claiming for higher consideration of this area in large scale conservation programs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationships between total calcium and phosphorus and ionised calcium and phosphorus values in clinically healthy tortoises.
   Methods: Jugular blood samples were obtained from 25 tortoises, as part of a health screen of the population. These comprised Hermann's tortoises, Testudo hermanni boettgeri, spur-thighed tortoises, Testudo graeca ibera, marginated tortoises, Testudo marginata, and horsfield tortoises, Testudo horsfieldi. Plasma from these samples were analysed for total calcium, ionised calcium and phosphorus levels. These samples were taken in the immediate posthibernation period, before the onset of reproductive activity.
   Results: Females exhibited statistically significantly higher levels of phosphorus. Ionised calcium and total calcium levels were elevated in females compared with males, but this was not statistically significant. Females did have statistically significantly higher calculated solubility indexes and statistically significantly lower ratios compared with males.
   Clinical Significance: This study has provided an insight into the ratios and solubility indexes in tortoises, and this information may lead to further understanding of the significance of these parameters in chelonians.

AB  - Males and females of Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) exhibit a conspicuous yellow patch on both their cheeks, whose origin and potential function are totally unknown. In this study, we measured the extent and the colour intensity of these patches in 29 male and 19 female tortoises in order to test for sexual difference in these features. In addition, we analysed the relationships between patch features and body condition to investigate the possible function of these ornaments as status signals. We detected symmetric yellow patches in all sampled females, while five males did not show at all the ornament, and two had a yellow patch only on the left cheek. Although head and scale size, as well as RGB values, did not differ between sexes, female patches were significantly larger than those of males. In addition, the extent of cheek patches was correlated to female body condition, suggesting that these ornaments may have evolved as honest signals of quality through sexual selection processes driven by female-female contests over rank or by male mate choice.

AB  - Tortoises belonging to the Testudinidae family are infected by Testudinid herpesviruses. Testudinid herpesvirus 3 (TeHV-3) is considered the most pathogenic and affects several tortoise species, particularly those from the Testudo genus. As most species of this genus are endangered contribute to ecological concerns over this virus. Here, we aimed to explore the rational development of an antiviral treatment against TeHV-3 using Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) as a host model. Ten antiviral compounds were tested in cell culture for their toxicity and their activity against TeHV-3. Eight compounds exhibited different levels of activity against TeHV-3 with either no or only minor cytotoxic effects on cells. Next, eprociclovir (EPV, ciprovir) was selected for further investigations in vivo. Its pharmacokinetic properties were investigated after a single sub-cutaneous administration at 5 or 10 mg/kg. Plasma concentrations remained above half maximal effective concentration (EC50) for 2.2 and 4.4 h after administration at 5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. Finally, EPV toxicity was investigated after administration at the dose of 10 mg/kg, BID for seven consecutive days. As early as one day after initiation of the treatment up to its end, EPV plasma concentration remained under the EC50. Apathy and anorexia developed after 7 days. Biochemical and anatomopathological examinations revealed nephrotoxic effects of EPV. Altogether, these data suggest that EPV is not a suitable molecule for the treatment of TeHV-3. Further studies are required to determine whether the other molecules identified here for their anti-TeHV-3 activity represent potential candidates for the development of efficacious treatments.

AB  - Many animals use chemical and visual cues to obtain reliable information about potential food resources. Most reptiles have evolved highly specialized chemosensory and visual capacities, in particular colour vision, to accomplish this task. By presenting animals with flowers and coloured cardboard discs in two-choice experiments, we examined whether both male and female Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) were able to distinguish between different colours, and show some preference for certain colours. We found that both sexes responded and discriminated equally between different colours, with some differences between flowers and discs. In particular, the red was preferred in the disc experiment, mainly by males, but was disregarded by both sexes in the flower experiment, where red was represented by poppy, Papaver rhoeas. This suggests that Hermann's tortoise probably relies on a mixed system of olfactory and visual abilities to detect food in order to optimize the intake of essential nutrients as minerals or carotenoids. Our results demonstrate that the most preferred colour by tortoises was the yellow, which might reflect carotenoid content, and we discuss the potential implications of this finding.

AB  - For the first time, inguinal palpation effectively detected calcified oviductal eggs in a tortoise species. Inguinal palpations for 36 Hermann's tortoises, from six samples during spring 1999 and spring 2000, were verified with X-ray radiography. Palpation results did not differ significantly from radiography results and did not differ between two independent observers. A logistic regression analysis indicated that palpation success depended on the presence of oviductal eggs, and not on observer, year (1999 or 2000) or tortoise age class (young adult or old adult). The probability of correctly classifying females as gravid or nongravid through palpation was 78.4%. Although inguinal palpation did not allow detection of all clutches, it is a simple, inexpensive and effective means to determine the breeding status of Hermann's tortoise populations.

AB  - Assessing population trends is a basic prerequisite to carrying out adequate conservation strategies. Selecting an appropriate method to monitor animal populations can be challenging, particularly for low-detection species such as reptiles. This study compares 3 detection-corrected abundance methods (capturerecapture, distance sampling, and N-mixture) used to assess population size of the threatened Hermann's tortoise. We used a single dataset of 432 adult tortoise observations collected at 118 sampling sites in the Plaine des Maures, southeastern France. We also used a dataset of 520 tortoise observations based on radiotelemetry data collected from 10 adult females to estimate and model the availability (g0) needed for distance sampling. We evaluated bias for N-mixture and capturerecapture, by using simulations based on different values of detection probabilities. Finally, we conducted a power analysis to estimate the ability of the 3 methods to detect changes in Hermann's tortoise abundances. The abundance estimations we obtained using distance sampling and N-mixture models were respectively 1.75 and 2.19 times less than those obtained using the capturerecapture method. Our results indicated that g0 was influenced by temperature variations and can differ for the same temperature on different days. Simulations showed that the N-mixture models provide unstable estimations for species with detection probabilities <0.5, whereas capturerecapture estimations were unbiased. Power analysis showed that none of the 3 methods were precise enough to detect slow population changes. We recommend that great care should be taken when implementing monitoring designs for species with large variation in activity rates and low detection probabilities. Although N-mixture models are easy to implement, we would not recommend using them in situations where the detection probability is very low at the risk of providing biased estimates. Among the 3 methods allowing estimation of tortoise abundances, capturerecapture should be preferred to assess population trends. (c) 2013 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Growth ring counts on the shell have been widely used for age estimation in Chelonians. However, as stated by Wilson et al. (2003), most studies have applied this method without assessing its reliability by proving that 1:1 ratio between number of rings and real age exists. In the present study, the reliability of this method is analysed for a population of Hermann's Tortoise, Testudo hermanni introduced in the Ebro Delta (NE Spain). Age estimations were obtained from direct observations of tortoises in the field in 2000 (n = 82) together with those from photographs of the same and other individuals of the population taken between 1991 and 2001 (n = 356). A second photograph was taken at one or more years after the first one for 101 individuals. Results of Model II linear regression analysis indicated that the method was reliable only for tortoises between 0 and 7 years old, whereas tended to underestimate age for those between 8 and 11 years. Since, sexual maturity in this population is attained around 8 years (mean for both sexes), ring counts are only reliable for juveniles and subadults. Finally, it is noteworthy that the results coming for photographs were equivalent to those coming from direct observations in the field.

AB  - Simple Summary The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of non-typhoidal Salmonella in the turtles housed in a regional wildlife rescue centre of Apulia, in southern Italy, to assess the presence of Salmonella serovars that may represent a risk for operators involved in wildlife management. Sixty-nine tortoises, of which 36 were males and 33 were females, belonging to different species (Testudo hermanni hermanni, T. h. boettgeri, T. graeca, and T. marginata) were tested. All the turtles were adults (34 between 6 and 10 years of age and 35 more than 10 years of age). Salmonella was statistically detected more frequently in T. hermanni hermanni. No differences of the infection prevalence related to animal gender or age were found. Two different species, S. enterica and S. bongori, three S. enterica subspecies (enterica, diarizonae, salamae), and five different serovars (Hermannswerder, Abony, Ferruch, Richmond, Vancouver) within the group S. enterica subspecies enterica were identified. Two Salmonella types with different combinations were simultaneously found in specimens of T. h. hermanni. Most of the detected Salmonella types may represent a potential risk for operators in wildlife rescue centres. Monitoring of infections that may be transmitted to humans by animals in wildlife rescue centres is very important in order to protect the staff engaged in rehabilitation practices. Salmonella may be a natural inhabitant of the intestinal tract of turtles, rarely causing disease. This may represent a potential risk for humans, increasing the sanitary risk for operators in wildlife rescue centres. In this paper, the occurrence of non-typhoidal Salmonella among terrestrial turtles housed in a wildlife rescue centre in Southern Italy was investigated, in order to assess the serovars more frequently carried by turtles and identify those that may represent a risk for operators involved in wildlife management. Sixty-nine adult turtles (Testudo hermanni hermanni, T. h. boettgeri, T. graeca, and T. marginata) were tested. Detection and serotyping of Salmonella strains were performed according to ISO 6579-1 and ISO/TR 6579-3:2013, respectively. The distribution of Salmonella spp. was significantly higher in T. hermanni hermanni than in other species, independent of the age and gender of the animals. Two different Salmonella species, S. enterica and S. bongori, three S. enterica subspecies (enterica, diarizonae, salamae), and five different serovars (Hermannswerder, Abony, Ferruch, Richmond, Vancouver) within the group S. enterica subspecies enterica were identified. Different combinations of Salmonella types were simultaneously found in specimens of T. h. hermanni. Most of detected Salmonella types may represent a potential risk for public health. Adopting correct animal husbandry procedures and informing on potential sanitary risks may be useful for minimising the risk of transmission of Salmonella to workers involved in wildlife management.

AB  - Between May 1989 and October 1990 a highway was constructed through the core area of one of the largest French populations of Testudo hermanni, a species seriously threatened by habitat loss and habitat fragmentation, Two general strategies were used to alleviate negative impacts of the highway on the tortoise population: first, 300 tortoises, that were directly, affected by the highway, construction, were temporarily maintained in outdoor enclosures and relocated after construction was completed; secondly, attempts were made to reduce traffic impacts on the tortoise population, including the use of fences to keep tortoises off the road and the construction of culverts and a tunnel under the road to provide for movements of animals between the separated habitat areas. The short-term outcome of this conservation exercise was a success: the annual survival rate of 78% observed in reintroduced tortoises was comparable to published results of translocation of other tortoise species into unfamiliar habitat, traffic mortality of tortoises in the 4 years following highway, construction was low and mark-recapture results indicate a stable adult population and the use of the culverts and the tunnel by tortoises to cross the road.

AB  - Natural marks have increasingly been used as a tool for individual identification in capture-mark-recapture techniques. Photo-identification is a noninvasive alternative to traditional marking techniques, allowing individual recognition of species through time and space. We tested the APHIS (Automatic Photo Identification Suite) software as a software capable of identi-fying individuals of Hermann's Tortoise (Testudo hermanni Gmelin, 1789) and European Pond Turtle (Emys orbicularis (Linneaus, 1758)) in different populations during capture-release sessions in the field based on plastron color patterns, since they can be used as natural marks for identification. For this individual identification, spot pattern matching (SPM) and image template matching (ITM) procedures were tested, achieving 100% success of individuals recognized in both procedures and visually ver-ified by comparing the images. However, the ITM procedure was more efficient at recognizing recaptures than SPM because ITM allowed faster recapture verification, since most of the matches were directly placed in the first position on the candidate list. Previous studies used photo-identification on freshwater or sea turtles but never with terrestrial tortoise species. Conse-quently, it was corroborated that APHIS is a competent and efficient software considering photo-identification of T. hermanni and E. orbicularis, and that it can be applied to close species with similar and unique individual color patterns in their plastron.

In this study, erythrocyte size and morphology of the turtles, Emys orbicularis hellenica and Mauremys rivulata (Emydidae), and tortoises, Testudo hermanni hermanni, and T. graeca ibera (Testudinidae), living in Turkey were examined. Twenty-five specimens were used in the study. There were 6 of E. orbicularis hellenica, 5 of M. rivulata, 5 of T h. hermanni, and 9 of T graeca ibera. Erythrocyte morphology of these examined species was described using Wright's technique. The sizes of erythrocytes and their nuclei were measured using an ocular micrometer at a magnification of 1600x. Results of this study were compared with previous work on the other reptile species. The largest and the widest erythrocytes were found in E. orbicularis hellenica and the smallest in T graeca ibera. In terms of the studied species, the nuclear and erythrocyte sizes were found to be correlated (Testudinidae: r = 0.494, p < 0.001; Emydidae: r = 0.668, p < 0.001). http://www.sinica.edu.tw/zool/zoolstud/42.1/173.pdf.

AB  - Dense vegetation cover undoubtedly offers certain advantages for small and slow-moving animals, but its disadvantages concerning some aspects of spatial ecology (e.g. movements) were neglected in previous studies. Tortoises could get stuck in vegetation by protuberant part of the shell and thus succumb to overheating, dehydration or predators. To examine how vegetation cover shapes behavioural responses of 'trapped' tortoises, we tested adults of six populations from habitats with contrasting vegetation cover. The tortoises were fitted with a non-stretchable rope, representing a piece of vegetation, stuck on the protruding front part of the plastron. Results suggested the existence of two distinct releasing techniques. First, and only successful in this study, is frequent changing of the movement direction, with a minimal pulling force, until the obstacle detached. The other involved the maximal pulling force aimed at ripping out the constraint. Tortoises from shrub habitats had more releasing success, used less pulling force and needed shorter time period to release, contrary to tortoises from herbaceous habitats. Although sexes showed similar releasing success, females obtained lower number of direction changes and higher yanking force compared to males, suggesting slightly different liberating strategies between the sexes. For immobilized tortoises without suitable shelter from overheating and dehydration, appropriate behavioural response could be vital, especially during drought years, due to increased physiological stresses. Variability of behavioural patterns among tortoise populations, described in this study, could have an adaptive significance.

AB  - The illegal trade has been threatening tortoise populations worldwide for decades. Nowadays, however, DNA typing and forensic genetic approaches allow us to investigate the geographic origin of confiscated animals and to relocate them into the wild, providing that suitable molecular tools and reference data are available. Here we assess the suitability of a small panel of microsatellite markers to investigate patterns of illegal translocations and to assist forensic genetic applications in the endangered Mediterranean land tortoise Testudo hermanni hermanni. Specific allelic ladders were created for each locus and tested on several reference samples. We used the microsatellite panel to (i) increase our understanding of the population genetic structure in wild populations with new data from previously unsampled geographic areas (overall 461 wild individuals from 28 sampling sites); (ii) detect the presence of non-native individuals in wild populations; and (iii) identify the most likely geographic area of origin of 458 confiscated individuals hosted in Italian seizure and recovery centers. Our analysis initially identified six major genetic clusters corresponding to different geographic macro-areas along the Mediterranean range. Long-distance migrants among wild populations, due to translocations, were found and removed from the reference database. Assignment tests allowed us to allocate approximately 70 % of confiscated individuals of unknown origin to one of the six Mediterranean macro-areas. Most of the assigned tortoises belonged to the genetic cluster corresponding to the area where the respective captivity center was located. However, we also found evidence of long-distance origins of confiscated individuals, especially in centers along the Adriatic coast and facing the Balkan regions, a well-known source of illegally traded individuals. Our results clearly show that the microsatellite panel and the reference dataset can play a beneficial role in reintroduction and repatriation projects when confiscated individuals need to be re-assigned to their respective macro-area of origin before release, and can assist future forensic genetic applications in detecting the illegal trade and possession of Testudo hermanni individuals.

AB  - According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), more than half of all chelonian species are seriously threatened. Habitat loss and illegal trade contribute substantially to this trend. Rare and vulnerable taxa often enjoy formal protection while taxa with large populations are usually neglected, despite worrying trends. The two subspecies of the Hermann's Tortoise (Testudo hermanni) present a good example of this contrast: the western subspecies (T. h. hermanni) is rare, while the eastern conspecific (T. h. boettgeri) is still relatively common in appropriate habitats. The IUCN lists the entire species as Near Threatened. In practice, the western subspecies is treated as endangered, while the assessment of the conservation status of the eastern counterpart is still lacking. Using field data collected from five populations of T. h. boettgeri in three Balk an countries, we aim at filling this gap. Population Viability Analyses (PVAs) suggest that even large and dense populations inhabiting favorable environments could face extinction by over-harvesting in a matter of years. Natural causes (e.g., higher female mortality) or stochastic events (e.g., wildfires) could be detrimental to peculiar isolated populations. The uncertain viability of the studied populations casts considerable doubt over the apparent stability of T. h. boettgeri. For this subspecies to avoid the fate of its western cousin, we propose the upgrade of its IUCN category to Vulnerable throughout its distribution range.

AB  - An extensive myiasis was observed in an adult male Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) with a missing distal part of the right forelimb and an exposed right humerus. Haematological examinaton indicated very low haemoglobin levels (37.00 g/1), low packed cell volume (PCV = 0.17 1/1), significant leucopenia (WBC = 2.75 G/1), an extremely low glucose concentration (0.64 mmol/1), hyperuricaemia (519.9 mu mol/1), and a high ALP (30.10 mu kat/1). Forty-three blowfly larvae were removed from the wound with a pair of foceps, using a lavage with saline and low-concentration povidone-iodine solution. The remaining part of the humerus was surgically dissected from the humeral girdle. Necrotizing edges were removed and the opening to the body cavity was closed with sutures. After the surgery was completed, the tortoise responded poorly to external stimuli and died 12 hours after the surgery. A post-mortem examination of the body cavity revealed only an enlarged, ochre coloured liver and no pathological changes could be detected in the other organs. A histological examination diagnosed steatosis and toxic necrosis of the hepatic parenchyma. Twenty-three larvae were kept on 20 g of beef at room temperature. Twenty puparia were available after 7 days. After 20 - 21 days, 19 fly imagoes (5 females, 14 males) were obtained and identified on the basis of their morphological features as the blowfly (Calliphora vicina Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830; Diptera: Calliphoridae). It is the first case of fully documented fatal reptile myiasis in the Czech Republic.

AB  - Physiological parameters provide indicators to evaluate how organisms respond to conservation actions. For example, individuals translocated during reinforcement programmes may not adapt to their novel host environment and may exhibit elevated chronic levels of stress hormones and/or decreasing body condition. Conversely, successful conservation actions should be associated with a lack of detrimental physiological perturbation. However, physiological references fluctuate over time and are influenced by various factors (e.g. sex, age, reproductive status). It is therefore necessary to determine the range of natural variations of the selected physiological metrics to establish useful baselines. This study focuses on endangered free-ranging Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni hermanni), where conservation actions have been preconized to prevent extinction of French mainland populations. The influence of sex and of environmental factors (site, year and season) on eight physiological parameters (e.g. body condition, corticosterone concentrations) was assessed in 82 individuals from two populations living in different habitats. Daily displacements were monitored by radio-tracking. Most parameters varied between years and seasons and exhibited contrasting sex patterns but with no or limited effect of site. By combining behavioural and physiological traits, this study provides sex-specific seasonal baselines that can be used to monitor the health status of Hermann's tortoises facing environmental threats (e.g. habitat changes) or during conservation actions (e.g. translocation). These results might also assist in selection of the appropriate season for translocation.

AB  - Many animals obtain reliable information about potential mates, including whether they are conspecific, sexually mature, and healthy or not, mostly from olfactory cues. Previous experiments with snakes and lizards have shown that individuals can recognize conspecifics, sex, mating status, and health condition of potential partners by chemical cues. Using choice experiments, we examined whether both male and female Hermann's Tortoises, Testudo hermanni, can detect and distinguish the odor of conspecifics from that of another species and an odorless control, and are able to discriminate sex and sexual maturity of individuals by chemical cues. We found that both sexes correctly discriminated between their own species and another species' odors, but only males can distinguish sex and sexual maturity of potential mates by olfactory cues. These results indicate a sexual dimorphism in olfactory sensitivity in this species that might be derived from sexual selection and suggest that males and females should rely on different communication channels during social interactions.

AB  - Although highly conservative in major lineages, skeletons of tetrapods can vary within groups. In chelonians, a large portion of the skeleton is "external," which makes it comparatively easy to study. I present several peculiarities in the shape and architecture of shells in the Hermann's tortoise, l'estudo herrnanni, from five localities in the Balkan Peninsula. These are: a hump in the rear part of the shell (in males), variability in the so-called neural formula (in both sexes), and unusually poorly curved pygal (and supracaudal) element in many males. These oddities were particularly frequent in an insular population, but were found in mainland samples as well. To my knowledge, this study presents the first qualitative and a preliminary quantitative analysis of shell aberrations within and among populations of any Iestudo species. More importantly, it was performed on extant populations: this enables monitoring of ontogenetic shell shape development, i.e. the emergence of anomalies, as well as their possible influences and consequences concerning survival and behaviour. Future research should aim at inferring genetic structure within and among Hermann's tortoise populations in the sampled region and in other parts of the Balkans.

AB  - Toxicosis associated with benzimidazole anthelmintics has been reported with increasing frequency in zoologic collections. Clinical signs, clinicopathologic abnormalities, and gross and histologic lesions are primarily the result of damage to the gastrointestinal and hematopoictic systems. Profound leukopenia, especially granulocytopenia. is the most common and severe clinicopathologic change associated with benzimidazole administration. Death usually occurs from overwhelming systemic bacterial and/or fungal infections secondary to severe immunosuppression. In this 125-day study, six male Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) were treated orally with two 5-day courses of fenbendazole 2 wk apart at a dosage of 50 mg/kg. Serial blood samples were used to assess hematologic and plasma biochemical changes before, during, and following the treatment period. Although the tortoises remained healthy, blood sampling indicated an extended heteropenia with transient hypoglycemia, hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and equivocal hyperproteinemia/hyperglobulinemia, which were considered to be in response to fenbendazole administration. Changes in several other clinicopathologic parameters appeared to correlate with fenbendazole administration. The hematologic and biochemical changes seen in the healthy animals in this study should be considered when treating compromised tortoises with fenbendazole. Hematologic and plasma biochemical status of tortoises/reptiles should be determined before treatment and monitored during the treatment period. The risk of mortality of an individual from nematode infection should be assessed relative to the potential for metabolic alteration and secondary septicemia following damage to hematopoietic and gastrointestinal systems by fenbendazole.

The remains date to the beginning of the 19th century and offer an insight into the life of the hospital's patients and practices of the attached medical school. Many of the animal remains consist of partially dissected skeletons, including the unique finds of Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) and Cercopithecus monkey. The hospital diet and developments in comparative anatomy are discussed by integrating the results with documentary research. They show that zooarchaeological study of later post-medieval material can significantly enhance our understanding of the exploitation of animals in this period

AB  - Simple Summary
   Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) are common and popular pets. Their life expectancy is over 80 years. The major threats to these tortoises include loss of natural habitat, pollution, urbanization, tourism, road deaths, the pet trade, and possible transmission of various infectious diseases. Health problems can begin during artificial incubation and last a lifetime. For this reason, it is necessary to breed healthy hatchlings, and tortoise welfare will increase in parallel. Conditions for hatching and control of egg failure must be controlled. The presence of unfertilized and infected eggs in the lowest possible numbers is important for successful hatching. These parameters can be improved by monitoring breeding parents. Proper hatching will keep many tortoises alive and allow them to live long healthy lives and is essential for tortoise welfare allowing a more economical method of breeding. In this study, the causes of embryonic mortality in Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) during artificial incubation on a large farm in Slovenia were determined. Possible improvements in Hermann's tortoise hatching and methods to increase animal welfare were described.
   The causes of embryonic mortality in Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) during artificial incubation were determined. Total egg failure at the end of the hatching period was investigated. The hatching artefacts represented 19.2% (N = 3557) of all eggs (N = 18,520). The viability rate of incubated eggs was 80.8%. The eggs, i.e., embryos, were sorted according to the cause of unsuccessful hatching and subsequently analyzed. Some of the eggs were divided into two or more groups. Unfertilized eggs were confirmed in 61.0%, infected eggs in 52.5%, and eggs in various stages of desiccation in 19.1%. This group also included mummified embryos. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus sp., Purpureocillium lilacinum, and Escherichia coli were frequently confirmed in infected eggs. Embryos were divided into three groups: embryos up to 1.0 cm-group 1 (2.2%), embryos from 1.0 cm to 1.5 cm-group 2 (5.4%) and embryos longer than 1.5 cm-group 3 (7.3%) of all unhatched eggs. Inability of embryos to peck the shell was found in 1.3%. These tortoises died shortly before hatching. Embryos still alive from the group 2 and group 3 were confirmed in 0.7% of cases. Dead and alive deformed embryos and twins were detected in the group 3 in 0.5% and 0.1% of cases, respectively. For successful artificial hatching, it is important to establish fumigation with disinfectants prior to incubation and elimination of eggs with different shapes, eggs with broken shells, and eggs weighted under 10 g. Eggs should be candled before and periodically during artificial incubation, and all unfertilized and dead embryos must be removed. Heartbeat monitor is recommended. Proper temperature and humidity, incubation of "clean" eggs on sterile substrate and control for the presence of mites is essential. Monitoring of the parent tortoises is also necessary.

AB  - The courtship and mounting behavior of promiscuous tortoises is based on a multiple signaling system that includes visual, olfactory, tactile, and acoustic signals. Vocalizations related to mounting seem to be particularly intriguing because tortoises vocalize mainly at this time. Vocalizations and courtship behavior might be costly for males, and if these costs increase differentially for different males, then the potential exists for vocalizations and displays to reveal male individual quality on which females could base their mate choice. In the present study, by using individuals breeding in seminatural enclosures, we experimentally investigated whether the mounting call of male Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) represents a relevant stimulus to both males and females. We also looked for potential preference toward different acoustic stimuli in order to determine which call features, if any, played a role in attracting potential partners or deterring rivals. Females were sensitive to call playback, whereas males apparently paid little attention to playback. In addition, females showed a significant preference toward high-pitched calls emitted at high rate. Also, females exhibited a strong tendency toward short-duration calls. Because call rate is related to hematocrit in Hermann's tortoise males, by responding to fast-rate calls females are also choosing high-quality partners as sires of their offspring. This is the first study in which an attractive function of tortoise vocalizations has been documented.

AB  - Context. Mediterranean areas offer a mosaic of favourable microhabitats to reptiles (e.g. open zones, thorny bushes) and are considered as biodiversity hotspots for these organisms. However, in these dry and hot environments, reptiles remain sheltered most of the time. They generally escape observation, posing difficulties to perform inventories. Trap sampling or rock-turning surveys commonly used to detect reptiles entail important logistical constraints, may perturb fragile microhabitats, and are not appropriate for chelonians. Alternative simple and cost-effective methods are desired.
   Aims. We tested the efficiency of camera trapping in a dry Mediterranean landscape, notably to detect threatened Hermann's tortoises. We tested whether small artificial freshwater ponds could attract animals in the field of view of the cameras to increase detectability. We also tested whether sand tracks survey around ponds could improve the method.
   Methods. We used a small number of cameras with ponds (5 in 2011, 7 in 2012), thereby maintaining low logistical costs. We randomly filled three ponds and emptied three ponds every 7 days. We set the time-lapse function of each camera with an interval of 5 min and inspected the sand tracks every 2 or 3 days. We used information from 39 radio-tracked tortoises to better estimate the detectability performances of the camera-pond system.
   Key results. This technique was effective to detect tortoises (n = 348 observations) and five other reptiles (among the 11 species present in the study area). Large numbers of birds and mammals were observed (n = 4232, n = 43 species at least), thereby increasing the biodiversity list of the surveyed area. We detected 28% of the radio-tracked tortoises present in the monitored area. Filled ponds were more attractive and sand track survey completed camera monitoring.
   Conclusions. Camera trapping associated with small ponds represent a useful tool to perform rapid inventories of the fauna in Mediterranean habitats, especially to detect the emblematic Hermann's tortoise and other cryptic reptiles (e.g. snakes).
   Implications. The low cost-efficiency ratio of this method allows performing multiple counting surveys, and thus may help collect robust data necessary to justify the protection of key habitats that are coveted by property developers.

AB  - Major landscape transformations have occurred in the northern Mediterranean over the last decades, including urbanization, agricultural intensification and land abandonment, which, in turn, increase the risk of the propagation of fire. We used repeated-count surveys conducted at 369 sites in France and Spain to jointly model the effects of environmental covariates on the abundance, occupancy and detection of Hermann's tortoise, a long-lived and endangered species, using a novel zero-inflated approach. We also employed a large dataset of presence-only data collected in Provence to model environmental influences on occurrence probability using maximum entropy models. In both France and Spain, sites that experienced wildfires over the last 50 years hosted 31% fewer individuals than unburned sites. In Provence, higher wildfire frequency decreased this species' occurrence probability, from 50% when 0-1 fire had occurred over the last 50 years, to 7% in areas that had burned at least 3 times. We also showed that abundance required a long recovery time (more than 25 years) after wildfires. In Provence, the highest occurrence probability for this species was found in patchy landscapes and scrub and/or herbaceous vegetation. The lowest species occurrence was found in extensive artificial areas, vineyards and arable lands. These results suggest a high risk of population extinction in the future if these types of habitats continue to expand in plains and coastal areas to the detriment of scrublands. Higher wildfire frequency predicted by climate change scenarios in the Mediterranean is also likely to increase the risk of extinction for some populations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To avoid the possible extinction of the last native population of western Hermann's tortoise in the Iberian Peninsula it is essential to make sound management decisions. Knowledge of macro and microhabitat use and home range size has considerable practical value for land managers. With this aim we first studied the home range and habitat preferences in western Hermann's tortoises by radio tracking 15 adults weekly from March 2008 to May 2009 in three localities within the Albera population range (NE Iberian Peninsula). We estimated home ranges with Fixed Kernel estimator (FK) and Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) after checking tortoise site fidelity. We observed that home range size did not differ significantly between males and females (mean FK = 2.01 ha, mean MCP = 3.01 ha). Secondly, we studied macrohabitat selection using a vegetation map. Preferred habitats were open shrubland, open forest and barren land during the activity period, and dense forest, dense shrubland and open shrubland during the hibernation. Next, we assessed microhabitat selection along five periods of the annual cycle: hibernation, emergence from hibernation, spring, summer and autumn. We then located marked tortoises weekly and classified the plant species observed in each location. Principal component analyses showed that tortoises selected shrubs with trees during hibernation, bramble during summer and herbaceous habitat during the breeding season. All these results can provide guidelines for management programs that set aside areas of habitat critical to conserve viable populations, although it is also important to prevent mortality from forestry works. We therefore tested a new brush cutter head accessory to achieve tortoise-safe undergrowth clearing. To this aim we distributed 52 frozen hybrid tortoises among eight plots of 100 m(2), cleared six of these plots with the accessory and two without it, and evaluated the scars of the blade on caparaces. We observed no damage in plots that were cleared with the accessory but scars in most carapaces in the plots cleared without it (with potential mortality ranging from 40% in neonates to 100% in adults). These results outline the importance of supporting habitat management decisions with proper field studies.

AB  - In terrestrial animals with rigid protective structures, the ability to upright after being overturned can make the difference between life and death, especially in suboptimal thermal conditions or in the presence of predators. This trait is assumed to be under strong selection. Different factors can influence righting ability, body dimensions and body mass for instance. As these morphological traits diverge among populations, inter-population variability in righting ability is expected. Previous studies on tortoises were performed within single populations and they usually focused on juveniles raised in captivity, precluding an assessment of the inter-population variability in a natural (realistic) context. In the current study, we quantified the righting performance in four populations of free-ranging adult tortoises. We found strong differences in righting success among populations and between genders, suggesting possible adaptations to local conditions. For instance, the topography (e.g. slopes) of each study site varied markedly. On average, males were more successful in righting themselves than females. Body size did not influence righting performances in males, but larger females were less successful compared to smaller ones. The success in righting was positively correlated with carapace domedness (height) and short bridges.

AB  - Like other terrestrial tortoises, the courtship behaviour of Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni Gmelin, 1789) is based on a multiple signalling system that involves visual, olfactory, tactile, and acoustic signals. In this study, we analysed relationships between male morphology, hematological profile, courtship intensity, vocalizations, and mounting success in Hermann's tortoises breeding in semi-natural enclosures to investigate the effects of male condition on signals exhibited during courtship and on their mounting success. Results showed that mounting success of Hermann's tortoise males was positively affected by the number of sexual interactions/h, number of bites given to the female during interactions, and by call rate and frequency-modulation range. Call rate, frequency-modulation range, and number of sexual interaction/h increased with hematocrit value, while number of bites given to females decreased with leukocyte concentration. In conclusion, courtship signals exhibited by Hermann's tortoise males, including vocalizations, reliably reveal different components of male condition, and females may use these multiple traits to choose high-quality partners. This is the first study documenting the condition-dependent nature of tortoise courting signals and their effect on male mounting success.

AB  - Background: Hermann's tortoise is one of the most popular reptiles kept as pet which underlines the importance to reinforce the information needed to provide advanced and adequate veterinary care in exotic animal species. Therefore, the purpose of this study, performed in Testudo hermanni, was to evaluate corneal touch threshold (CTT) and its feasibility according to age and body weight.
   Methods: Fifty-one healthy tortoises were classified in 2 groups (2 years [young; n = 25] and 8-10 years [subadult; n = 26]). Central CTT was measured by means of a Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer and defined as the filament length required to elicit a blink in at least 3/5 applications. CTT feasibility according to body weight was also evaluated by diving the individuals in weight groups consisting of "lighter" (<400 g [n = 31]) and "heavier" (>= 400 g [n = 20]) animals.
   Results: Mean CTT was 5.99 cm for the whole population (90% CI: 5.87-6.11), being 5.98 cm for young (90% CI: 5.81-6.15) and 6 cm for all subadult (90% CI: 6.00-6.00) tortoises, and 5.98 cm for lighter (90% CI: 5.84-6.13) and 6 cm for all heavier (90% CI: 6.00-6.00) tortoises. No statistical differences were detected between age and weight groups (P = 0.159 and P = 0.159, respectively). Three animals presented unilateral faint fluorescein uptake postesthesiometry (3/51; 2.9%) that resolved spontaneously within 48 hours.
   Conclusions and clinical relevance: Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer was a safe means of confirming high corneal sensitivity in all tortoises, which was high regardless of age. Increasing filament lengths would ultimately be required to determine the true corneal sensitivity scope of Testudo hermanni.

AB  - This study describes experiences obtained with microchipping of Hermann's tortoises in Slovenia. Over a period of three years, a total of 5,128 Hermann's tortoises from parental breeding stock were microchipped. Microchips were implanted subcutaneously in the left inguinal region. During the application of microchips, males were bleeding in 2.6% and females in 1.4% of the cases. Bleeding frequency was related to sex, animal size and environmental temperature at the time of microchipping. The presence of microchips was followed up over a period of several years. At the control check conducted a few years later, all previously microchipped tortoises were included. Out of the entire parental breeding stock, 235 (4.6%) had lost their microchips, thus 63 males (5.7%) and 172 females (4.3%) were unmarked. The possible reasons for microchip loss are migration or inactivity of the implanted microchips.

AB  - We describe the behavioral adaptations of a population of Hermann's tortoise to the climate of a northern sector of its range, and to a wooded biotope that is uncommon for the species. The activity, the home range, and the thermal relations along the daily and the yearly cycle are described. In contrast to other populations that have bimodal activity peaking in spring and in autumn, the tortoises in our study area had unimodal seasonal activity that can be related to lower summer temperatures. Home range size, 7.4 ha for females and 4.6 ha for males in our study area, was from three to seven times larger than that of all other populations. The large home range, and the low population density of the tortoises in our study area, may be due to food scarcity in the wooded habitat.

AB  - Climatic shifts may increase the extinction risk of populations, especially when they are already suffering from other anthropogenic impacts. Our ability to predict the consequences of climate change on endangered species is limited by our scarce knowledge of the effects of climate variability on the population dynamics of most organisms and by the uncertainty of climate projections, which depend strongly on the region of the earth being considered. In this study, we analysed a long-term monitoring programme (1988-2009) of Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) aimed at evaluating the consequences of the drastic changes in temperature and precipitation patterns predicted for the Mediterranean region on the demography of a long-lived species with low dispersal capability and already suffering a large number of threats. Capture-recapture modelling of a population in the Ebro Delta (NE Spain) allowed us to assess the effect of climate variability on the survival of tortoises. Winter rainfall was found to be the major driver of juvenile and immature survival, whereas that of adults remained high and constant across the study. Furthermore, local climate series obtained ad hoc from regional climate simulations, for this and 10 additional Mediterranean locations where tortoises occurred, provided us with reliable future climate forecasts, which were used to simulate the fate of these populations under three precipitation scenarios (mean, wet and dry) using stochastic population modelling. We show that a shift to a more arid climate would have negative consequences for population persistence, enhancing juvenile mortality and increasing quasiextinction risk because of a decrease in recruitment. These processes varied depending on the population and the climate scenario we considered, but our results suggest that unless other human-induced causes of mortality are suppressed (e. g. poaching, fire, habitat fragmentation), climate variability will increase extinction risk within most of the species' current range.

AB  - The Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) is increasingly threatened in Western Europe and in Italy because of habitat loss, pollution, and illegal removal of free-ranging individuals for the pet trade. Hence, the conservation and appropriate management of the various populations is mandatory, and the few remnant, isolated populations inhabiting urban parks and heavily altered landscapes may be particularly important. An urban population of Hermann's tortoises was studied by capture-mark-recapture procedures in an 'urban green area' in Rome ('Insugherata' Natural Reserve), between March 2001 and October 2005. A spatial modelling approach (logistic regression, with forward stepwise addition model) was developed to investigate which proximate landscape factors influenced the presence/absence of the tortoises. Eight different variables were considered for this model. We found that a single variable (SHRUBS, i.e. Mediterranean dry macchia-like vegetation) was positively correlated to the presence of tortoises, and one to their absence (ECOTONE, i.e. ecotone area constituted by different types of shrubs growing on a relatively wet substratum). The tortoise activity deviated significantly from the null hypothesis of an equal activity throughout the year, with the higher peaks of activity in May, June, and August, and reduced activity in March and April. The conservation implications of our study were also discussed.

AB  - A group of approximately 370 Egyptian tortoises (Testudo kleinmanni) and 36 spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) were illegally imported into Italy from Libya. Within 6 mo of their entry into Italy, all but 40 of the Egyptian tortoises had died with signs of severe stomatitis. Herpesviruses were detected from the tongues of seven Egyptian tortoises by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and virus isolation. Sequencing of a portion of the UL39 homologue of the herpesviruses from three different tortoises demonstrated that the viruses were identical to one another and identical to a herpesvirus isolated from a Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) in Germany. This is the first description of the detection of a herpesvirus from diseased Egyptian tortoises. That these animals were imported into Europe from Libya provides circumstantial evidence for the presence of herpesviruses among tortoises in northern Africa.

The up to now rather uncommon infection was diagnosed in a group of Testudo hermanni in a private collection. Symptoms and course of the disease resemble those of a herpesvirus infection. Affected tortoises, mostly well-developed adults, show diphtheroid inflammation of oral mucosa, pharyngitis and conjunctivitis. Therapy consisted of a combination of antiviral, antibiotic and immune stimulating drugs. Even two years after the first outbreak, no new outbreak could be observed.

AB  - Hermann's tortoise (Eurotestudo hermanni) from a mesic area of Central Italy (Isernia, Molise) was investigated during a two-year period (2003-2004). The population is characterized by a fairly high density when compared to other Italian and European populations, with density ranging from 16.16 individuals/ha in 2003 to 25.08 individuals/ha in 2004 (average density 20.84/ha). The sex ratio was 1: 1 both in 2003 and 2004. Females were captured in higher percentages from May to July in both years, while males were most abundant from August to October. These differences can be related to the different needs and behaviour of males and females in the two periods, and to the environmental constraints of the study area. All the marked tortoises were found aged between 10 and 21 years. Adult males and females from the study area were small-sized when compared to those from other Italian and European populations.

AB  - Reproduction is the key to the ecological invasion of alien species. As an invasive species, the characteristic and regularity of red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans) spermatogenesis is an index for evaluating reproduction and ecological adaptation. Here, we investigated the characteristics of spermatogenesis i.e., the gonadosomatic index (GSI), plasma reproductive hormone levels, and the histological structure of testes by HE and TUNEL staining, and then RNA-Seq in T. s. elegans. The histomorphological evidence confirmed that seasonal spermatogenesis in T. s. elegans has four successive phases: quiescence (December-May of the following year), early-stage (June-July), mid-stage (August-September), and late-stage (October-November). In contrast to 17 beta-estradiol, testosterone levels were higher during quiescence (breeding season) compared to mid-stage (non-breeding season). Based on RNA-seq transcriptional analysis, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were used to analyze the testis in the quiescent and mid-stage. Our study found that circannual spermatogenesis is regulated by interactive networks including gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, the number of genes associated with proliferation and differentiation (srf, nr4a1), cell cycle (ppard, ccnb2), and apoptosis (xiap) were up-regulated in the mid-stage. With the maximum energy saving, this seasonal pattern of T. s. elegans determines optimal reproductive success and thus adapts better to the environment. These results provide the basis for the invasion mechanism of T. s. elegans and lay the foundation for deeper insight into the molecular mechanism of seasonal spermatogenesis in reptiles.

AB  - Mediterranean ecosystems are severely impacted by urbanization, habitat clearing, fires and landscape fragmentation; conservation actions are urgently needed. The protection status of a given area depends notably on the presence and detection rate of protected species. Further, habitat restoration, conservation translocations, or population reinforcement require precise information on the distribution of individuals. Thus, the success of important conservation measures relies on the capacity to locate individuals. Thanks to their sense of smell combined with high learning abilities, dogs have been used to track a wide range of biological targets. They generally surpass humans to detect cryptic species. In this study, we aimed at testing their detection performances with Hermann's tortoises. This secretive reptile provides a typical case of threatened Mediterranean species where protection actions are hampered by low detection rates; especially because low population densities increase the risk of false negative results during surveys. The ability to detect and save individuals, for example before destructive land-work, might be crucial. We evaluated the detection ability of dogs to find tortoises with two experiments. First, field trials showed that relative detection rate was three times higher in dogs compared to well-trained humans. Then, and more importantly, the absolute detection rate of dogs to find radio tracked tortoises was excellent: after two trials, dogs rapidly located all the experimental tortoises dissimulated along different field transects. Overall, dogs were very efficient in finding tortoises, especially well-hidden individuals. More generally, the immense potential of trained dogs should be extended to improve the techniques to detect and protect Mediterranean reptiles.

AB  - Shell damage occurs frequently in tortoises, and represents evidence of non-lethal injuries of both natural and anthropogenic origins. By analyzing the occurrence of non-lethal injuries in 130 free ranging Hermann's Tortoises (Testudo hermanni) in Italy, we observed that significantly more damage was present (nearly 90% of the sampled tortoises) at sites < 1 km from cultivated areas. Further, we found an increased prevalence of wounds and enhanced severity of damage to individuals (considering both the carapace and plastron) at these sites. Interestingly, near agricultural activities, most injuries were concentrated on the rear of the carapace. This pattern of injuries is compatible with threat sources coming from above, such as agricultural machinery. As expected, the carapace was the most injured shell region, showing different kinds of damage: abrasions (superficial or deep enough to expose the bony layer), indentations, fractures, and fire damage. The incidence of individuals with abrasions and minor indentations (the most common injuries) did not vary between sexes or by body size; thus, injuries were seemingly independent from the rates of activity and the distances traveled by tortoises, which usually vary with sex and age. We found, however, shell deformation due to deep fractures and fire damage more frequently in older (bigger) tortoises. Given the progressive reduction and fragmentation of T. hermanni habitat due to the expansion of human activities, the presence of uncultivated buffers and the protection of natural and semi-natural areas inside agricultural landscapes should be considered as a key target for T. hermanni protection.

AB  - Background: Hermann's tortoise, Testudo hermanni, is currently on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list of endangered species. Reptile medicine relies also on laboratory analyses to evaluate health status, but reference ranges for hematology and biochemistry variables and protein electrophoresis in plasma of healthy tortoises are not available.
   Objective: The purposes of this study were to establish reference ranges for select hematologic and biochemical variables in clinically healthy Hermann's tortoises, and evaluate the impact of sex and season.
   Methods: Blood samples were collected from 34 healthy tortoises at the end of September and beginning of July. Blood smears, HCT, concentrations of HGB and select plasma biochemical analytes, select enzyme activities, and plasma protein fractions were evaluated. Reference ranges were determined and checked for influence of sex and sampling time point.
   Results: Typical reptilian RBC and WBC were observed in blood smears. HCT and concentrations of HGB, uric acid and urea, and ALT and AST activities were significantly higher in males than in females. Concentrations of glucose, uric acid, and phosphate, and AST activity were significantly higher at the beginning of July, whereas concentrations of urea and Cl were higher at the end of September prior to hibernation. The electrophoretic protein fractions included albumin, and alpha, beta, and gamma globulins.
   Conclusions: The reference ranges defined in the present study are useful for clinical tortoise medicine and conservation. Sex and seasonal sampling were identified as factors significantly affecting hematology and blood chemistry analytes; they should be taken into consideration when assessing tortoise health status.

AB  - In this study, we explored if, how, and when the European Union habitats (EU sensu Habitats Directive 92/43/CEE) are used by the flagship species Testudo hermanni in a well-reserved coastal dune system of the Italian peninsula. Radio telemetry data and fine-scale vegetation habitat mapping were used to address the following questions: (a) is each EU habitat used differentially by Hermann's tortoises? (b) is there any seasonal variation in this utilization pattern? (c) how does each habitat contribute to the ecological requirements of the tortoises? Nine tortoises were fitted with transmitters and monitored for the entire season of activity. The eight EU habitats present in the study area were surveyed and mapped using GIS. The seasonal preferential use or avoidance of each habitat was tested by comparing, through bootstrap tests, the proportion of habitat occupied (p(i)Th) with the proportion of available habitat in the entire landscape (p(i)L). The analysis of 340 spatial locations showed a marked preference for the Cisto-Lavanduletalia dune sclerophyllous scrubs (EU code 2260) and a seasonal selection of Juniperus macrocarpa bushes (EU code 2250*), wooded dunes with Pinus (EU code 2270) and mosaic of dune grasslands and sclerophyllous scrubs (EU codes 2230, 2240, 2260). Seasonal variation of habitat preference was interpreted in light of the different feeding, thermoregulation and reproductive needs of the tortoises. Our results stress the ecological value of EU coastal dune habitats and suggest prioritization of conservation efforts in these ecosystems. (C) 2015 Academie des sciences.

AB  - Delayed maturity and high survival rates of immatures and adults characterize long-lived species' life histories. Understanding how these traits interact in stochastic environments is essential to understand early life in long-lived species and to assist conservation planning. Unfortunately, available information of demographic traits in immatures are often fragmentary and the logistical difficulties of capturing and recapturing this cohort leave little room for improvement. Published immature chelonian survival estimates vary broadly, are often not age-specific, and lack precision. In an attempt to overcome this issue, we developed a novel modelling approach based on Capture-Recapture data to obtain robust age-specific survival probabilities in two chelonian species (the freshwater European pond turtle, Emys orbicularis, and the terrestrial Hermann's tortoise, Testudo hermanni). More specifically, we show that implementing a linear relationship between survival probabilities and age does not distort survival estimates and improves precision. Both species display a progressive increase in survival with age, reaching a plateau at the ages of four to five. As maturity occurs later in both species (8-12 years-old), the survival plateau might be governed by the final hardening of the carapace, which brings obvious survival benefits. Taking advantage of the flexibility of multievent models we encourage a systematic field approach even when very large samples from immatures cannot be amassed. Only so can demographic traits in chelonians, and more generally in long-lived species, be properly explored.

AB  - The alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii) is a species for which captive propagation and reintro-duction programs are well established; however, little is known about its reproductive behavior and physiology. In this study, we measured monthly plasma sex steroid hormone concentrations of androgen (T + DHT) estradiol-17B (E2), and progesterone (P4), and used ultrasonography to monitor annual reproductive cycles of a captive population of alligator snapping turtles that is maintained under semi-natural conditions in southeastern Okla-homa. Concurrently, we used automated radio telemetry to measure the relative activity levels of male and female alligator snapping turtles and examine these activity patterns in the context of their reproductive cycles. We also measured monthly concentrations of the glucocorticoid (GC) corticosterone (CORT). Seasonal variation was only detected for T in males, but was observed for T, E2, and P4 in females. Vitellogenesis began in August and ended in April and coincided with elevated E2. Ovulation took place 10-29 April and the nesting period lasted from 11 May - 3 June. Males exhibited greater relative activity levels than females in the fall, winter, and early spring, which coincided with the period when mature sperm would be available for mating. Females were more active than males during the peri-nesting period in the spring. Seasonal changes in CORT were detected and did not differ between males and females. CORT concentrations were elevated in the late spring and summer, coincident with the foraging season, and depressed in the fall, and winter, and at their nadir in the early spring.

AB  - Translocations to restore populations of endangered species are an important conservation tool, but a reliable diagnosis is needed to assess their success. We used capture-recapture modeling to analyze the adult apparent survival of released and resident tortoises in two translocation projects in Spain monitored for 14 and 29 years. We tested if long-term survival rates differ between released and resident individuals, if survival was lower during the phase of establishment (i.e. release cost), how long acclimation lasts and if increased density due to releases affects survival. We found lower survival of released tortoises during the phase of establishment (1 to 3 years) when residents were already present. After establishment, survival was very high and unaffected by density-dependence. Body condition before release was similar between recaptured and dead/missing tortoises, and did not predict establishment survival. Stochastic population viability analysis showed that success when releasing small numbers of individuals strongly depends upon adult long-term survival. Release of small second batches of tortoises was not sensitive to a growing population, regardless of its release timing. Our results highlight long-term survival as crucial in translocation projects of long-lived species, invalidating short-term (first year) survival assessment, when survival release cost does not match long-term survival. A release cost of different duration should be included in model estimation before modeling predictions. Releasing tortoises (for welfare of captive individuals or for mitigating human negative impacts) in an already established population is not recommended under most circumstances. Acclimation cost is followed by survival approaching wild counterparts. If this milestone is not achieved, the project needs to be carefully assessed to adopt other management options or should be stopped altogether.

AB  - We compared variation in phalangeal and carpal morphology of the Central Asian Testudo horsfieldii, a burrow-digging tortoise species, with its sister taxon T. hermanni, a Mediterranean species without extensive digging behaviour. Thirty-two Testudo horsfieldii kazachstanica shared the same phalangeal formula (0-2-2-1-1). The distal carpal 1 and metacarpal 1 as well as the pisiform were consistently lacking, sometimes also the medial centrale. Phalangeal morphology was more variable in Testudo hermanni hermanni. In 29 specimens four phalangeal formulae were found that differed with respect to the reduction of digit 1 (1-2-2-2-1, M-2-2-2-1, D-2-2-2-1, 0-2-2-2-1). The pisiform develops late in ontogeny and is lacking in very most juveniles and subadults. In contrast to T h. kazachstanica, the medial centrale is always present. In both T h. kazachstanica and T h. hermanni carpalia increasingly fuse with age and size. The underlying morphological patterns differ however. The extreme character state in aged T. h. kazachstanica is one large solid bone element, formed by the fused intermedium, ulnare and both centralia. Aged T. h. hermanni have, in contrast, two separate larger carpal elements, one formed by the fused lateral and medial centralia and the other by the fused distal carpalia 1 and 2; the intermedium and ulnare never fuse with one another or with other carpalia. While a partial or complete loss of digit 1 seems to be characteristic for all Testudo species, we propose that the extensive fusion of carpal elements in T horsfieldii is correlated with its natural history because a rigid manus could be advantageous for burrow-digging. Also the reduction of digit 4 (one phalanx present), a rare character among testudinids and not occurring in other Testudo species, could be linked with its mode of life.

AB  - The Early Pleistocene site of Pietrafitta (central Italy) produced a rich vertebrate assemblage from the Late Villafranchian Land Mammal Age (late MN18). Geological and paleobotanical data from Pietrafitta indicate a lacustrine environment, surrounded by a humid deciduous broadleaved forest with a temperate climate. The vertebrate assemblage consists of at least 40 taxa including actinopterygians, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Here, we concentrate on the ichthyofaunal and herpetofaunal remains. The ichthyofauna includes Barbus Cuvier and Cloquet, 1816, Scardinius Bonaparte, 1837, aff. Squalius Cuvier, 1817, and Tinca Cuvier, 1817. The two anuran genera are the large-sized alytid frog Latonia Meyer, 1843 and the "green frog" Pelophylax Fitzinger, 1843. Three snake precloacal vertebrae were recognized, one attributed to Colubrines indet., another one to -Natrix sp. Laurenti, 1768, and the largest and most complete vertebra is referred to the genus Vipera s.l. Laurenti, 1768 (cf. gr. "Oriental vipers"). The chelonian fossils, including some complete carapaces and plastrals, are attributed to the European pond turtle (Emys gr. Orbicularis Linnaeus, 1758) and Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni Gmelin, 1789).

AB  - The N-mixture model is widely used to estimate the abundance of a population in the presence of unknown detection probability from only a set of counts subject to spatial and temporal replication (Royle, 2004, Biometrics60, 105-115). We explain and exploit the equivalence of N-mixture and multivariate Poisson and negative-binomial models, which provides powerful new approaches for fitting these models. We show that particularly when detection probability and the number of sampling occasions are small, infinite estimates of abundance can arise. We propose a sample covariance as a diagnostic for this event, and demonstrate its good performance in the Poisson case. Infinite estimates may be missed in practice, due to numerical optimization procedures terminating at arbitrarily large values. It is shown that the use of a bound, K, for an infinite summation in the N-mixture likelihood can result in underestimation of abundance, so that default values of K in computer packages should be avoided. Instead we propose a simple automatic way to choose K. The methods are illustrated by analysis of data on Hermann's tortoise Testudo hermanni.

AB  - Studies into the function of structures are crucial for making connections between morphology and behaviour of organisms, but are still rare for the terrestrial Testudinidae. We investigated the kinematics of shoulder girdle and forelimb motion in Hermann's tortoise Testudo hermanni using biplanar X-ray fluoroscopy with a twofold aim: firstly, to understand how the derived shapes of shoulder girdle and carapace together influence rotation of the girdle; and, secondly, to understand how girdle rotation affects forelimb excursion. The total degree of shoulder rotation in the horizontal plane is similar to a species with a less domed shell, but because of the long and nearly vertically oriented scapular prong, shoulder girdle rotation contributes more than 30% to the horizontal arc of the humerus and nearly 40% to the rotational component of step length. The antebrachium and manus, which act as a functional unit, contribute roughly 50% to this component of the step length because of their large excursion almost parallel to the mid-sagittal plane. This large excursion is the result of the complex interplay between humerus long-axis rotation, counter-rotation of the antebrachium, and elbow flexion and extension. A significant proportion of forelimb step length results from body translation that is due to the propulsive effect of the other limbs during their stance phases. Traits that are similar to other tortoises and terrestrial or semi-aquatic turtles are the overall slow walk because of a low stride frequency, and the lateral-sequence, diagonally coupled footfall pattern with high duty factors. Intraspecific variation of carapace shape and shoulder girdle dimensions has a corresponding effect on forelimb kinematics.

AB  - It was analyzed the effectiveness of one method of individual and unique marking, alternative to the application of microchip, on 17 specimens of Testudo hermanni through DataDot(DNA) technology. This technology has proven to be an effective system of marking of Testudo spp., answering the need for unambiguous identification of individuals. Further advantages are the easy application and reading, the long-term resistance as well as the difficulties of possible fraudulent tampering.

AB  - Humans spontaneously match information coming from different senses, in what we call crossmodal associations. For instance, high-pitched sounds are preferentially associated with small objects, and low-pitched sounds with larger ones. Although previous studies reported crossmodal associations in mammalian species, evidence for other taxa is scarce, hindering an evolutionary understanding of this phenomenon. Here, we provide evidence of pitch-size correspondence in a reptile, the tortoise Testudo hermanni. Tortoises showed a spontaneous preference to associate a small disc (i.e. visual information about size) with a high-pitch sound (i.e. auditory information) and a larger disc to a low-pitched sound. These results suggest that crossmodal associations may be an evolutionary ancient phenomenon, potentially an organizing principle of the vertebrate brain.

AB  - We review in detail the published fossil record of turtles from Sardinia and, in addition, we document previously undescribed specimens for the first time. Among these undescribed specimens, is the oldest occurrence of Testudo hermanni on the island, from the Early Pleistocene of Monte Tuttavista. The turtle fossil record in Sardinia goes back to the Eocene and comprises 18 different taxa, pertaining to 6 lineages: Podocnemididae, Cheloniidae, Emydidae, Geoemydidae, Testudinidae, and Trionychidae. Remarkable is the occurrence of Eocene pleurodires, whose presence is in agreement with the Oligo-Miocene rifting of the Corso-Sardinian block. Interestingly, the fossil record provides evidence for the presence in the island of both Testudo hermanni and Emys orbicularis during the Pleistocene although according to molecular data the extant populations of these two taxa were introduced in recent times. Finally, a large ungual phalanx from the Middle-Late Pleistocene Monte San Giovanni bone breccia testifies the occurrence of a giant tortoise in the Quaternary terrestrial ecosystem of Sardinia.

AB  - The tortoise Testudo hermanni is endangered by habitat fragmentation and loss in western Europe, where its high public profile and specific conservation projects make this a flagship species. Studies of movement in the peak reproductive season (June) showed that home ranges were substantially larger in France than in Greece. This difference was due to the intensity of use of the home range, not to the distance moved which was remarkably similar in the two areas. There was no sexual difference in home range area. The home range was therefore not large in France because of movement to nesting sites, but rather for utilization of the greater habitat complexity there. The need for reserves to include different vegetation types makes conservation of T. hermanni in France more difficult. Conversely, the need for large reserves increases its value as an umbrella species for conservation of biodiversity.

AB  - Peloponnesus peninsula (S. Greece) shows a remarkable extant chelonian fauna that has received considerable attention from a molecular and morphological point of view. Here we present new evidence from the fossil and sub-fossil record of two important sites in the area, Franchthi Cave and Megalopolis. The archaeological material from Franchthi Cave (Upper Paleolithic - Neolithic/latest Pleistocene - early Holocene) represents food remains from small game prey of the humans that inhabited the cave. The palaeontological material from Megalopolis (Late Pleistocene) comes from old and new excavations. The studied specimens, combined with information from molecular, climatic and zoological works, provide for the first time direct evidence for the presence of the European pond turtle, Emys orbicularis, in the glacial refuge of South Greece that was hypothesized on the basis of the results of molecular investigations. We also describe other chelonian taxa present in the localities, the Hermann's tortoise Testudo hermanni and the Balkan stripe-necked terrapin Mauremys rivulata, and review previously published chelonian material from Peloponnesus.

AB  - Eighteen Greek tortoises (Testudo hermanni), divided into three groups, were kept at three different average ambient temperatures. Gastrografin((R)) was administered to all individuals by orogastric tube at a dosage of 1 ml/130 g body weight. The partial and total transit times were recorded by means of radiographs taken immediately postadministration and at 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, and 150 min and 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr postadministration. Mean total transit times were 2.6 hr (range 1.5-4.0 hr) at 30.6 degrees C, 6.6 hr (range 3.0-8.0 hr) at 21.5 degrees C, and 17.3 hr (range 8.0-24.0 hr) at 15.2 degrees C. These transit times allow a radiologic diagnosis within a relatively short period, especially compared with contrast studies performed with barium sulfate. The visualization of the intestinal tract is good with Gastrografin((R)); however, intestinal mucosal detail was not completely satisfactory.

AB  - Reptiles, supposedly, do not produce pheomelanin pigments. Because this claim is based on rather weak evidence, we measured the shell pheomelanin content in the Hermann's Tortoise (Eurotestudo boettgeri). In contrast to expectation, we detected a substantial amount of this pigment. Given the recent interest in the adaptive function of melanin-based color traits, our study opens new avenues of research in reptiles.

AB  - Various studies were done during a spontaneous outbreak of stomatitis-rhinitis-complex (mouth rot) in a collection of Mediterranean land tortoises (21 Testudo hermanni, Kermann's tortoises, and three Testudo graeta, spur-thighed tortoises) in southern Germany. These studies were intended to help diagnose the causative agent, establish a possible diagnostic method in vivo and provide information on the efficacy of aciclovir and ganciclovir against chelonian herpesviruses. Thirteen T. hermanni and no T. graeca died within a period of 6 weeks following the introduction of one apparently healthy T. graeca. Two of the dead Testudo hermanni were submitted far post-mortem examination. In addition, blood samples from 11 of the 12 tortoises still surviving at the beginning of this study were cultured for virus content and for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to chelonian herpesviruses and swabs from conjunctiva, pharynx and cloaca were cultured for the presence of viruses. Herpesviruses were isolated from tissues of the two dead Testudo hermanni (tongue, intestine, trachea, lung, spleen, heart and brain). Peripheral leukocytes from one of 11 blood samples were positive for herpesvirus isolation, indicating viremia in at least one animal. Nine of 11 pharyngeal swabs but none of the conjunctival and cloacal swabs yielded herpesviruses. Circulating neutralizing antibodies were present in two of two tested T. graeca, but absent in all of the nine samples from T. hermanii. Aciclovir and ganciclovir were effective when tested in vitro against one of the herpesvirus isolates.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the morphology and ultrastructure of the pronephros of Testudo hermanni as observed in the earlier part of its development. This paired structure appears during renal ontogenesis and originates from the first somites localised in the cephalic part of the embryo. The first pronephric evidence is noted at stage 12. The kidney is composed of large glomeruli that are devoid of a capsule and protrude into the coelomic cavity. A ciliated nephrostome provides access to short renal tubules, lined with a well-developed brush border. Two nephric ducts on the lateral sides of the embryo are connected to the tubules. The cytological characteristics of the pronephric structure suggest that it might be functional, at least in the first part of development. The pronephros of Testudo hermanni regresses after a short time around stage 18, while the mesonephros is already well differentiated. Its plesiomorphic characteristics, similar to those observed in amphibians, might be related to the phyletic position of chelonians within the reptiles.

AB  - Extensive radiotracking of adult Testudo hermanni for 1 year, and regular inspections for 5 years, in a coastal area of central Italy, allowed us to assess the seasonal variation in mobility and home range size of both sexes, and their use of the different parts of home range.  Males are more mobile than the females but, due to a different long-term movement pattern, they have a generally smaller home range.  Both sexes show a marked seasonal variation in home range size, but no seasonal migrations.  Wild rabbits burrows, and simple pallets under dense vegetation are repeatedly used as shelters by the same individual.  The animals show a certain preference for specific basking areas in the midst of dense shrubbery.  They feed mainly on vegetation common throughout the study area but special displacements in order to forage also occur.  Mating encounters are based on home range overlapping between mates and high male mobility.  Our findings and those of other authors on different populations of the same species suggest that these activities act together to produce the long-term home range stability observed in wild T. hermanni even though none of them is performed at a constant site.

AB  - In six tortoises (3 spur-tailed mediterranean land tortoises, Testudo hermanni, 2 Horsefield's tortoises, Agrionemys horsfieldii, and one spur-thighed mediterranean land tortoise, Tesfudo graeca) from Austrian keepers herpesvirus-infections occurred. All animals showed massive diphtheroid stomatitis and glossitis. Histologically intranuclear inclusion bodies were found in large numbers in epithelial cells of the tongue. Intranuclear inclusion bodies were also detected in liver cells and in respiratory epithelial cells in one tortoise and in neurons in the brain of another animal. The inclusions consisted of nonenveloped hexagonal nucleocapsides. They measured about 110 to 140 nm and were identified as herpesviruses.
   A cytopathic effect was observed in a chicken embryo fibroblast cellculture.

AB  - Despite exhibiting low velocity and limited agility, many tortoises undertake large scale movements and must overcome various obstacles, notably in populations living in hilly or rocky habitats. Although crucial, studies exploring how tortoises move in complex and irregular environments are scarce. In this context, we examined an important behavioural trait: how tortoises (Testudo hermanni) deal with step-like obstacles. In their natural habitat, individuals were positioned in a challenging situation: they were placed on a bench approximately 50cm high, and were observed over a 10-min period. We compared the behaviour of the tortoises (taking a risk to jump' or waiting) from two populations living in contrasted habitats: flat versus rugged (crisscrossed by cliffs and rocky steps). Individuals from the flat habitat were reluctant to jump, whereas most tortoises from the rugged habitat jumped. Immature tortoises were less willing to jump compared to larger and more experienced adults. These results suggest that challenging habitats increase boldness. In addition to fundamental findings, these results may have conservation value and assist in improving translocation strategies for endangered tortoise populations.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London

AB  - We investigated the relation between righting time (RT) and carapace morphology in 303 adult Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni Gmelin, 1789) from two geographically close localities. Their size, shape and body mass, adjusted for size, were significantly different between males and females. Righting time differed among the populations and was related to the ambient temperature and the relative body mass and carapace shape. However, analysis showed that the impact of carapace "form" (shape plus relative body mass) alone had only moderate influence on the variation in righting time ("function"). Both "form" and "function" did not contribute much to the segregation of individuals in geometric space, based on either sex or locality. An interesting detail was that tortoises with a height/width ratio of the shell contour higher than 0.75 had quite a short righting time (less than 100 seconds), which is in accordance with the proposed theoretical model of energy balance of righting in chelonians We suppose that interactions between general carapace "form", specific components of shell structure, physiological parameters and local environments shape variation in righting response in this species. An interdisciplinary approach combining geometric modeling with traditional biological disciplines would be needed to support this hypothesis.

AB  - Coercive copulation is frequent in promiscuous mating systems, generating both benefits (e.g. higher copulation rate) and costs (e.g. injuries and fewer foraging opportunities). The negative consequences of sexual harassment are expected to increase with increasing population density with male-biased operational sex ratio (OSR). This study offers an example in which the frequency and severity of the injuries inflicted on female tortoises during forced copulations increased with population density and biased OSR. Male Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) harass females during courtship, ramming and biting them until they eventually force mating. They also use their horny and mobile tail to stimulate females, sometimes damaging their cloaca. We compared the frequency and severity of cloacal injuries between two populations in the Republic of Macedonia. Under high density and balanced OSR at one site (Konjsko), 25% of females exhibited cloacal injuries. Under very high density and extremely biased OSR at another site (Golem Grad Island), 75% of females were wounded, often severely. Furthermore, exclusively on Golem Grad, many small and immature females were courted and wounded. This behavioural shift toward juveniles generated costs without benefits. Perhaps brutal reproductive behaviours in male Hermann's tortoises evolved under low or moderate population densities? Under very high densities, coercive mating seems maladaptive, negatively affecting females and possibly further skewing OSR.

AB  - Objecitive: Establishment of 20 blood reference values of terrestrial tortoises kept in Germany and comparison of the parameters of four different species of mediterranean tortoises. Material and methods: Blood samples were taken from the dorsal coccygeal vein of 61 clinically normal terrestrial tortoises kept in Germany, and 20 hematological and biochemical parameters were analyzed. All animals tested had been raised in or were part of one of five selected tortoise collections for at least three years. All of them were housed outdoors from spring to fall and underwent hibernation regularly. Their diet consisted of exclusively herbivore nourishment. All 61 terrestrial tortoises belonged to the following species: Testudo marginata (marginated tortoise, n = 16), Testudo graeca (spur-thighed tortoise, n 15), Testudo hermanni (Hermann's tortoise, n = 22) and Testudo horsfieldi (Russian tortoise, n = 8). Results: Median, minimum and maximum values and p-values were determined for the following parameters: packed cell volume (PCV), alanin aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), alkaline phosphatase (AP), creatine kinase (CK) uric acid, urea nitrogen (BUN), cholesterol, glucose, fructosamine, total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, cholinesterase (CHE), sodium, potassium, total calcium, ionized calcium and inorganic phosphorus. Conclusions and clinical relevance: Statistically significant differences between tortoise species were detected for 10 out of 20 parameters. The obtained results lead to the conclusion that species differentiation within the group of "mediterranean tortoises" is very important when interpreting blood parameters.

AB  - The idea that the size of animal populations may be regulated by factors intrinsic to them, such as behaviour, has a long history in ecology. Although this idea is now rejected as a general mechanism, it may apply in some species where females are damaged during courtship attempts, such as the Mediterranean tortoise Testudo hermanni. The sex ratios (adult males : adult females) of most dense Greek populations were more extreme lover 1.5:1) than could be accounted for by the earlier age at maturity of males, and some ranged to over 6:1. The sex ratio was correlated with the population density of adult males and the frequency of courtship attempts on females, and negatively correlated with the longevity of females. A high population density of males limits the density of adult females. This intrinsic regulation of population size is a consequence, rather than a goal, of a particular type of courtship behaviour (persistent thrusts by the male using a tail with a sharp terminal spur) in T. hermanni. Existing population densities at many Greek sites are probably unnaturally high, owing to the reduction of natural predators.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies revealed substantial differences in the structure of the mouth and the caudal end, and made possible to differentiate the new species from the others. SEM studies showed the real and sound characteristics of the genus Mehdiella, namely number of anal papillae 2 instead of 3, post-anal papillae pedunculate or sessile instead sessile.

AB  - Free-living and captive chelonians might suffer from upper respiratory tract disease (URTD), a pathology primarily caused by Mycoplasma agassizii. Wild tortoises can also be an important reservoir of Salmonella spp., which are commensal in the host reptile but are potential zoonotic agents. Between July 2009 and June 2010, we screened free-living European tortoises (spur-thighed tortoises Testudo graeca, Hermann's tortoises Testudo hermanni, marginated tortoises Testudo marginata) temporarily housed in a wildlife center in Italy. We molecularly characterized 13 Mycoplasma isolates detected in all Testudo spp. studied, and three PCR-positive animals showed typical URTD clinical signs at the time of sampling. Three Salmonella enterica serotypes (Abony, Potsdam, Granlo), already related to reptile-associated human infections, were also identified. These results highlight the potential role played by wildlife recovery centers in the spread and transmission of pathogens among wild chelonians and to humans.

AB  - Enrofloxacin belongs to the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics. It is commonly used in a variety of reptile species due to its wide spectrum of efficacy, partly due to its formation of an active metabolite ciprofloxacin. Enrofloxacin shows wide disposition variability among all species resulting in large differences in the plasma concentrations of both enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin after a single intracoelomic injection of 10 mg/kg of enrofloxacin in 9 tortoises (Testudo hermanni). Blood samples were collected at 0, 0.5, 2, 4, 10, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192, 216, 240 and 264 h and analyzed using a validated high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) florescence method. Plasma concentrations of enrofloxacin were quantifiable in all subjects for up to 240 h, while ciprofloxacin was detected in all subjects up to 120 h. The C-max (s) of enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were 8614 +/- 1116 eta g/mL obtained at 2.19 h and 605 +/- 43 eta g/mL obtained at 4.23 h, respectively. The values of C-max/MIC ratio and AUC(0-24)/MIC ratio of enrofloxacin with a MIC value of 0.5 mu g/mL were 17.23 and 132.78, respectively. In conclusion, an administration of 10 mg/kg of enrofloxacin via the intracoelomic route in Hermann's tortoises produced optimal pharmacodynamic parameters.

AB  - The critically endangered Radiated Tortoise (Astrochelys radiata) is endemic to the southern coastlines of Madagascar. Once common, wild populations of this tortoise have undergone dramatic declines in recent years. Although there have been studies documenting reproductive activities, reproductive physiological parameters are unknown yet may be crucial in the recovery of the species. Over four research seasons in remote field locations native to A. radiata, we surveyed for, radio-tracked, and sampled wild, free ranging tortoises. We sampled and measured stress and reproductive parameters (corticosterone [CURT], testosterone [T], estradio1-17 beta [E2], and progesterone [P]) in 311 plasma samples from 203 wild A. radiata, capturing their active period. Generally, hormone concentrations were associated with body condition, temperature, and humidity. There was wide variation in CORT that varied monthly and by group. Juvenile tortoises maintained more than twice the mean basal CORT concentrations than either adult sex, with the most dramatic distinctions in the middle of the wet season. For adult sex hormones, the last months of the dry season and into the wet season when ground humidities are low and just begin to rise prior to temperature declines, male T concentrations gradually increased to a peak before returning to near undetectable values into the dry season. We had limited data for T concentrations in females, but found average T concentrations were much lower than in males and positively correlated with larger female home range sizes. For female hormone cycles, E2 also peaked in the early 1/3 of the wet season along with male T, and was followed by an uptick in P which correlates to the putative ovulatory cycle. Females tracked over four years showed variation in patterns of P, indicating that number and frequency of clutches vary. Our results suggest that 1) there is high species plasticity in response to stress; 2) A. radiata reproductive cycling is somewhat dissociated with courtship timing and is instead triggered by environmental cues; and 3) individual female reproductive output is irregular. This study is one of the first to document and describe multi-year seasonal stress and reproductive hormones in a free-ranging Malagasy chelonian. These data may be used to identify key high-production habitats for conservation, and aide in captive management and reproduction in assurance colonies for species health and survival.

AB  - In an effort to define the effect(s) of lithium heparin and tripotassium EDTA on various hematologic parameters in Testudo hermanni, we collected blood samples from 29 clinically healthy adult individuals of both sexes. Portions of each blood sample were transferred to tubes containing either lithium heparin or tripotassium EDTA. The following determinations were made on samples of blood from each anticoagulant: red and white cell counts, packed cell volume, hemoglobin concentration, red cell indices, and differential white cell counts. Due to hemolysis, hematocrits could not be determined from blood samples in EDTA. Further, red blood cell counts were lower in the EDTA samples than in the heparin samples, again due to hemolysis associated with EDTA. However, EDTA did not appear to interfere with hemoglobin determinations. Heparin blood samples provided more optimal blood smears than did EDTA samples, thus differential leucocyte counts were determined only from smears taken from heparin blood samples. Further, thrombocyte and leucocyte aggregation was not observed with heparin use. Thus, heparin is considered the anticoagulant of choice in chelonians for determining red blood cell counts, erythrocyte indices, and hematocrits. When May-Grunwald-Giemsa stain was compared with Diff-Quick, thrombocytes could be more easily differentiated from lymphocytes using the May-Brunwald-Giemsa stain. Heterophil granules seemed to coalese more when Diff-Quick was used. Eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes were similar in appearance with both staining methods.

AB  - Brain lateralization in response to social stimuli is well known for its involvement of the right hemisphere in several vertebrate species, including humans. This study aimed to investigate the laterality of the social behavior during the mirror-images inspection in tortoises (Testudo hermanni). In a rectangular apparatus, in presence or in absence of two mirrors as the longer walls, we assessed: 1) the animal's position and 2) the monocular viewing compared to the longer walls, 3) the paw used to start a movement from a resting position. Here we provide the first evidence of lateralization towards social stimuli in tortoises, a reptile that is likely to lead mostly a solitary life, but also able to show a few basic abilities in social cognition. Results revealed a preference to spend significantly more time in peripheral positions, mainly in the presence of mirrors. Moreover, a consistent left-eye preference to inspect the mirrors was observed, especially when close to them. In contrast, a significant right-eye preference appeared in absence of mirrors, when tortoises occupied the central areas. Findings show a significant preference for right-paw use in starting movements, when mirrors were present. Results are discussed with reference to other evidence of brain asymmetry.

AB  - Lateralization of brain and behaviour at the population level has been documented in all vertebrate classes. Research was mostly carried out on mammalian and avian species, the least investigated class with this regards being the Reptilia, with studies concentrating on lateralized aggressive behaviour in lizards. No research has been carried out on lateralization in the Chelonian order. We investigated the presence of motor asymmetries in the tortoise Testudo hermanni, using the righting response (i.e. the animal is positioned upside-down and the left/right side to which it uprights is observed), a procedure already employed to assess behavioural lateralization in amphibians. The ability of righting has a particularly high adaptive value in tortoises, as in case of overturning, and consequent exposure to sunrays, changes in body temperature and difficulties in respiration could occur leading to serious conditions. Thirty-four tortoises underwent a series of righting tests in a standardized apparatus, 15 tortoises were also retested 10 months later. A bias at the individual as well as at the population level was found for preferentially turning on the right side. Consistency of responses at retest was also observed. The results are discussed with reference to the implications for the evolution of brain lateralization in vertebrates. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Hermanns tortoise (Testudo hermanni) is an endangered land tortoise distributed in disjoint populations across Mediterranean Europe. We investigated its genetic variation by typing 1 mitochondrial locus and 9 nuclear microsatellites in approximately 300 individuals from 22 localities. Our goal was to understand the relative impact of natural and human-mediated processes in shaping the genetic structure and to identify the genetic priorities for the conservation of this species. We found that 1) all geographic areas are highly differentiated, mainly as a function of their distance but with a clear genetic discontinuity (F-st values larger than 0.4) between the Eastern and the Western subspecies; 2) the contact zone between subspecies is located farthest to the west than previously believed, and it probably coincides with the delta of the largest Italian river; 3) extinction events due to climatic conditions in the Upper Palaeolithic and subsequent human-mediated translocations in the Neolithic possibly explain the unexpected similarity among Spain, Sicily, and Corsica. For conservation purposes, the large majority of genetic pools appears native although hybridization among subspecies, related to extensive 20th century trade of tortoises across Europe, is observed in Spain and some Italian samples. Most populations do not seem at immediate risk of low genetic variation, except the French population, which has very low nuclear genetic diversity (heterozygosity 0.25) and where 50 out of 51 sampled animals shared the same mitochondrial sequence. In general, restocking and reintroduction plans should carefully consider the genetic background of the individuals.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the long-term effects of two different vitamin and mineral supplements on the growth and health of Hermann's tortoises. Twelve one-month-old tortoises were randomly divided into two groups of six animals (group A and B). Diets were supplemented on a daily basis with two different products ("A": vit. D-3 50 000 IU/kg, 150 g/kg Ca or "B": vit. D-3, 2000 IU/kg, 148 g/kg Ca) for 12 months. Product "B" was richer in most of the vitamins. Weight and shell parameters were measured weekly. After one year animals in group B had significantly higher final body weights than those in group A (186.7 g vs. 131.6 g). The shell of the individuals in group A was firm and healthy, while all the tortoises in group B (in different levels) had weakened shells. The loss of bone tissue was not so serious to have visual signs on x-rays. High amount of vitamins (vitamin E, K, B-1,B- 2,B- 6,B- 12, biotin) given for safety reasons and relatively low level of vitamin D3 (like in product "B") applied on a daily basis seem to be disadvantageous. The moderate metabolic bone disease that developed in group B during the experiment could be treated after the study by using the supplement "A'' The authors recommend such supplements which have similar ingredients to product "A" for growing tortoises housed indoor with low or without irradiation exposure to UVB.

AB  - Adult annual survival rates estimated by mark-recapture for eight Greek populations of the tortoise Testudo hermanni were in the range 0.80-1.0 (mean 0.886). Estimates from growth rings for the same populations were in a similar range (0.84-0.95. mean 0.899). The average survival rate from the two methods was significantly positively related to mean adult body size (r = 0.815) and negatively related to effective temperature (r = - 0.880). A life table model was used to investigate the consequences of adult survival rate for optimum age at maturity and mean adult size of females. The basis of the model was the trade-off between increased reproduction from large adult size, and decreased survival to maturity from delayed age at maturity. The model showed that the observed variation in adult survival rates was more than sufficient to account for the variation of adult size among populations. The model thus predicted an even greater range of mean adult size than that observed. A negative correlation between growth rate and adult survival rate or age at maturity, as observed, was needed to fit the size data. The model supports the hypothesis that variation in adult size of T hermanni in Greece is adaptive (rather than a non-adaptive environmental or phylogenetic effect) and due to variation in adult survival rates (rather than other factors such as juvenile survival).

AB  - Armoured animals can easily lose their balance and fall on their back. When overturned, they can be exposed to suboptimal environment conditions, starvation or predation, thus, self-righting has a vital importance. Chelonians' stiff shells prevent torsion of the torso, thus influence of the dorsum shape on self-righting can be significant. We explored the relationship between duration of active self-righting attempts and shell geometry in Hermann's tortoises. We used geometric morphometrics and shell shape indices (R index, sphericity and flatness indices) to explore this effect. Our results showed a negative relationship between size and righting performance in both females and males. Enlarged females' body, and thus reduced agility, could be favoured by fecundity selection. On the other hand, the body size of males is probably affected by sexual selection. Additionally, enlarged flared rear marginal scutes in males negatively affect self-righting. This part of males' shells could be shaped by the trade-off between self-righting and stability during courtship and mating. However, the relationship between carapace shape and righting performance is not straightforward, as different results were obtained when various shape indices were applied in the analyses. The indices imply that greater curvature of the carapace shape facilitates self-righting in Hermann's tortoises. Comparison of available literature data and results of this study imply that shell shape across the Testudo genus, except for T. marginata, largely overlaps with shell shape of T. hermanni. Thus, a similar effect of shell shape on self-righting performance could be expected for most of Testudo species. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - The kinematics of intraoral food transport of Testudo hermanni were investigated by radiographic video analysis. Small lead markers and contrastmedia marked food pellets were used to describe the movements of the hyolingual apparatus, the jaws, and the food passage during feeding events. The feeding cycle is divided into food uptake, several intraoral transport cycles, and finally swallowing of the food. The results show features of a terrestrial feeder highly adapted to herbivorous diet: usage of tongue during ingestion, tongue-based intraoral transport combined with food manipulation prior to swallowing. The tongue of T. hermanni is equipped with long papillae and numerous lingual glands. Roughness of the tongue surface and sticky saliva produce interlocking forces acting on the food which facilitate food uptake, transport, and manipulation. Cineradiographic analysis enables complete documentation of the food passage during feeding events and, combined with conventional video recordings, allows more valid statements about the kinematics of feeding mechanisms.

AB  - Deslorelin acetate is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist formulated in a controlled-release subcutaneous implant and designed for reversible suppression of testosterone production in dogs. It has also been demonstrated to be effective in other animal species, but no data on its effectiveness in male land tortoises are available. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a 4.7-mg deslorelin acetate implant on serum testosterone concentrations in male Hermann's (Testudo hermanni sp.) and Greek (Testudo graeca sp.) tortoises. Twenty adult male tortoises housed under the same environmental conditions were enrolled for the study and randomly assigned to a treatment (D, n = 10) or a control (C, n = 10) group. Starting in May, males from the D group were implanted with a 4.7-mg deslorelin acetate device, whereas males from the C group did not receive any treatment. Blood samples were collected once immediately before implant application (S0-May) and at 15 days (S1-June), 2 (S2-July), and 5 (S3-October) months after application. Serum testosterone at each sampling time was measured through a solid-phase, enzyme-labeled, competitive chemiluminescent immunoassay. Median serum testosterone concentrations were not significantly different between the two groups in all sampling times, and no interaction between treatment and sampling time was observed. The present study, therefore, suggests that a single treatment with a 4.7-mg deslorelin acetate implant has no effect on testosterone circulation in male Hermann's and Greek tortoises during the following 5 months.

AB  - In 2007, 2008 and 2009 the authors carried out an extensive study of the amphibian and reptile fauna of the island of Mljet resulting in the detection of 12 species. One amphibian and 11 reptile species were recorded (Emys orbicularis, Testudo hermanni; Hemidactylus turcicus, Podarcis melisellensis, Dalmatolacerta oxycephala, Pseudopus apodus; Coronella austriaca, Hierophis gemonensis, Zamenis longissimus, Malpolon insignitus and Vipera ammodytes). In addition, previous publications reported findings of Bulb viridis, Anguis Elaphe quatuorlineata and Zamenis Made. Lacerta agilis and Podarcis siculus were obviously mentioned erroneously. With a total of 16 species, the island of Mljet is of average herpetofaunal richness among Mediterranean islands but one of the richest Adriatic islands.
   Four species are listed in the Red Data Book of endangered amphibians and reptiles of Croatia: Caretta caretta as endangered (EN), Emys orbicularis and Testudo hermanni as near threatened (NT), and Zamenis situla as data deficient (DD).

AB  - This paper explores the presence of tortoise remains and its meaning in Palaeolithic archaeological contexts. We focus on two topics: (1) the presence or absence of the genus Testudo from the Early Pleistocene to the Holocene in SW Europe; and (2) the relationship between Testudo and the palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental conditions diachronically. In order to address this objective, we collected published and unpublished data from different sites on the eastern Iberian Peninsula. The results obtained by this study demonstrate that Testudo hermanni was the only tortoise present in this area until recent times and its presence in archaeological sites is almost always related to anthropic activities. Finally, the disappearance of Testudo from archaeological sites in some areas is related to climatic changes and events that occurred during the last stages of the Pleistocene. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Condition in the tortoise Testudo hermanni was assessed using the ratio of observed mass (M) to that predicted (M') from the allometric relationship M=aL(b), where L is body length. A condition index (CI) was based on regressions of log M on log L in July (taken as a standard); these regressions differed significantly between females and males. The CI log M/M' was slightly left-skewed, but was preferred to the simple ratio M/M' for ease of analysis of interaction effects. Log M/M' ranged from approximately -0.1 to +0.1 in the wild, equivalent to observed mass of 80-120% of predicted mass. Condition varied seasonally, being low after emergence from hibernation, maximal in spring (April to June), and decreasing in autumn. The detailed pattern of seasonal variation differed significantly between adult females, adult males, and subadults. Regression equations for log M on log L in different months are provided for a seasonally-adjusted condition index (CIs), to assess the relative condition of individuals and annual samples measured in different months.

AB  - Assigning individuals to their source populations is crucial for conservation research, especially for endangered species threatened by illegal trade and translocations. Genetic assignment can be achieved with different types of molecular markers, but technical advantages and cost saving are recently promoting the shift from short tandem repeats (STRs) to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Here, we designed, developed, and tested a small panel of SNPs for cost-effective geographic assignment of individuals with unknown origin of the endangered Mediterranean tortoise Testudo hermanni. We started by performing a ddRAD-seq experiment on 70 wild individuals of T. hermanni from 38 locations. Results obtained using 3182 SNPs are comparable to those previously obtained using STR markers in terms of genetic structure and power to identify the macro-area of origin. However, our SNPs revealed further insights into the substructure in Western populations, especially in Southern Italy. A small panel of highly informative SNPs was then selected and tested by genotyping 190 individuals using the KASP genotyping chemistry. All the samples from wild populations of known geographic origin were genetically re-assigned with high accuracy to the original population. This reduced SNPs panel represents an efficient molecular tool that enables individuals to be genotyped at low cost (less than euro15 per sample) for geographical assignment and identification of hybrids. This information is crucial for the management in-situ of confiscated animals and their possible re-allocation in the wild. Our methodological pipeline can easily be extended to other species.

AB  - A chelonid herpesvirus was isolated from a group of tortoises in Italy with a history of increased mortality and upper digestive and respiratory tract disease. The isolated virus was inactivated with formalin and used to prepare a nonadjuvanted vaccine and a vaccine adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide. 57 tortoises, 26 Testudo hermanni, 25 T. graeca, and 6 T. marginata, were included in the study. The animals were vaccinated 3 times at 45 day intervals. Blood was collected from the animals 14 days prior to the first vaccination, and on day 0, 25, 45, 90, 113 and 369 after the first vaccination. Plasma antibody titers to the homologous chelonid herpesvirus were determined using a virus neutralization test (VNT). No significant rise in antibody titer was noted in the vaccinated animals. Antibody titers measured dropped below the cutoff-level sporadically in all positive animals. Repeat serological testing may therefore be necessary in order to detect seropositive animals.

AB  - The Alyki wetland in northern Greece is a site of notable herpetological and ornithological importance. A large population of the tortoise Testudo hermanni began to recover slowly (r = 0.016) between 1990 and 1999, following catastrophic habitat destruction in 1980 and slow decline from 1980-1990. Heathland vegetation showed signs of desiccation, probably due to increased drainage by the salt works, including deterioration of Crataegus, Ruscus and Asphodelus, and loss of formerly important food plants of tortoises. Activity and body mass condition of tortoises were reduced in summer in grassy heath habitats. Predation of artificial (chicken egg) tortoise nests increased, and the relative frequency of juveniles (about 1 % of samples) was lower than after severe habitat destruction or pesticide damage. These changes were attributed to an increasing population of badgers, Meles meles. Population levels of waders were lower in 1998/1999 than in 1988/1989, especially avocets (Recurvirostra avosetta) for which the site was internationally important. Breeding populations of most waders and larids also declined. Mediterranean gulls, for which Alyki was formerly the most important breeding area outside Russia, did not nest from 1990 to 1998, and nests were unsuccessful in 1999. Changes in breeding populations were due to falling lagoon levels, exposure to predators and vegetation encroachment on islet breeding sites. Midwinter waterfowl populations remained high or increased, however, as alternative feeding areas were available in the lagoon. Preservation of the habitats against development of the salt works and increasing desiccation are necessary to maintain the long-term conservation value of the Alyki site.

AB  - A virus was isolated from tissues of 2 diseased Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) and preliminarily characterized as an iridovirus. This conclusion was based on the presence of inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of infected cells, sensitivity to chloroform, inhibition of virus replication by 5-iodo-2'-desoxyuridine and the size and icosahedral morphology of viral particles. The virus was able to replicate in several reptilian, avian and mammalian cell lines at 28 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C. Restriction enzyme analysis showed resistance of the viral DNA to digestion With HpaII due to methylation of the internal cytosine at CCGG sequences. Part of the genomic region encoding the major capsid protein was amplified by PCR and subjected to sequence analysis. Comparative analysis of the obtained nucleotide sequence revealed that the isolate is closely related to frog virus 3, the type species of the genus Ranavirus.

AB  - An outbreak of diarrhea in an outdoor group of captive Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) was associated with fecal shedding of cryptosporidial oocysts, as determined by coproscopic and immunoassay examinations. With partial sequencing of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene, 2 different Cryptosporidium genotypes could be identified in the fecal samples. Cryptosporidium tortoise genotype has previously been found in tortoise and ophidian species, and Cryptosporidium ducismarci has been reported from a snake and a chameleon, and it has been linked to intestinal disease in tortoises. The Hermann's tortoises described were also infected with oxyurid nematodes. Treatment specific for reptilian cryptosporidiosis was administered. The clinical signs and fecal shedding ceased, but 9 months later, diarrhea and fecal shedding were seen in 3 animals again. Either the oocyst shedding was temporarily suppressed below detection limits, or the animals were reinfected by oocysts still present in the environment. At least 1 of the detected Cryptosporidium genotypes was presumed to contribute to the clinical symptoms.

KW  - NEMATODES
AB  - Thirty-six tortoises (Testudo hermanni) with naturally acquired oxyurids infections were used to assess the anthelmintic efficacy of oxfendazole (Dolthene (R); Merial) and fenbendazole (Panacur (R); Hoechst Roussel Vet). Animals were randomly assigned to three groups (A, B, and C) based on sex and weight. Animals in group A (seven males and six females) were orally treated with oxfendazole at dose rate of 66 mg/kg, group B animals (nine males and eight females) were orally treated with fenbendazole at dose rate of 100 mg/kg, and group C animals (three males and three females) were not treated and served as controls. All animals were individually stabled in plexiglas boxes under controlled conditions of temperature, humidity, and light beginning 7 days pretreatment and continuing for the duration of the trial. Individual tortoises feces were examined daily by the McMaster technique and drugs efficacy was assessed by the fecal eggs count reduction (FECR) test. Both drugs showed 100% of FECR. However, oxfendazole reached this level 12 days after treatment, whereas 31 days after treatment were necessary to obtain the same stable result with fenbendazole. The two drugs were well tolerated by all the animals and no adverse reactions were observed after treatment.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence and diversity of Campylobacter species in chelonians. From July 2016 to September 2017, a total of 452 individuals from a large variety of tortoises (n = 366) and turtles/terrapins (n = 86) kept in private collections and breeding centres, wildlife rescue centres, zoos, pet shops, and veterinary clinics from Northern Italy was sampled and subjected to microbiological examination. Campylobacter genus and species confirmation was performed by single and multiplex PCRs. Out of 452 samples, five (1.1%) tested positive: three for C. iguaniorum (two Testudo graeca and one Testudo hermanni), one for C. fetus subsp. testudinum (Stigmochelys pardalis) and one for C. geochelonis (Testudo hermanni). This study suggests that Campylobacter spp. are not common in chelonians, but a variety of species can be detected in these hosts, including those potentially pathogenic for humans. Further studies are needed to understand the epidemiology and the pathogenic potential for both animals and humans of reptile-associated Campylobacter spp.

AB  - Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni), the best-known western Palaearctic tortoise species, has a rare natural distribution pattern comprising the Mediterranean areas of the Iberian, Apennine, and Balkan Peninsulas, as well as Sicily, Corsica and Sardinia. The western part of this range is traditionally considered habitat for T. h. hermanni, while T. h. boettgeri occurs in the Balkans. Taxonomy of this tortoise has been challenged in recent years, with the two subspecies being considered full species and the central Dalmatian populations of T. h. boettgeri being considered a third species, T. hercegovinensis. Using an mtDNA fragment approximately 1150 bp long (cytochrome b gene and adjacent portion of tRNA-Thr gene), we investigated mtDNA diversity with regard to contrasting concepts of two subspecies or three species. Seven closely related haplotypes were identified from the western Mediterranean and 15 different, in part much-differentiated, haplotypes from the Balkans. Western Mediterranean haplotypes differ from Balkan haplotypes in 16-42 mutation steps. One to seven mutation steps occur within western Mediterranean populations. Balkan haplotypes, differing in 1-37 nucleotides, group in parsimony network analysis into three major assemblages that display, in part, a similar degree of differentiation to that of western Mediterranean haplotypes relative to Balkan haplotypes. Rates of sequence evolution are different in both regions, and low divergence, palaeogeography and the fossil record suggest a slower molecular clock in the western Mediterranean. While monophyly in western Mediterranean haplotypes is well-supported, conflicting evidence is obtained for Balkan haplotypes; maximum parsimony supports monophyly of Balkan haplotypes, but other phylogenetic analyses (Bayesian, ML, ME) indicate Balkan haplotypes could be paraphyletic with respect to the western Mediterranean clade. These results imply a process of differentiation not yet complete despite allopatry in the western Mediterranean and the Balkans, and suggest all populations of T. hermanni are conspecific. In the western Mediterranean no clear geographical pattern in haplotype distribution is found. Distribution of Balkan haplotypes is more structured. One group of similar haplotypes occurs in the eastern Balkans (Bulgaria, Republic of Macedonia, Romania and the Greek regions Evvia, Macedonia, Peloponnese, Thessaly and Thrace). Two distinct haplotypes, differing in eight to nine mutation steps from the most common haplotype of the first group, are confined to the western slope of the Taygetos Mts. in the Peloponnese. Yet another group, connected over between four and 23 mutation steps with haplotypes of the eastern Balkan group, occurs along the western slope of the Dinarid and Pindos Mts. (Istria, Dalmatia, western Greece). Taygetos haplotypes are nested within other haplotypes in all phylogenetic analyses and support for monophyly of the other Balkan groups is at best weak. We conclude that using the traditional two subspecies model should be continued for T. hermanni. Phylogeographies of T. hermanni and Emys orbicularis, another codistributed chelonian, are markedly different, but share a few similarities. Both were forced to retreat to southern refuges during Pleistocene glaciations. With the advent of Holocene warming, E. orbicularis underwent rapid range expansion and temperate regions of Europe and adjacent Asia were recolonized from refuges in the Balkans and the northern Black Sea Region. By contrast, T.
   hermanni remained more or less confined to refuges and nearb regions, resulting in a much smaller range, and allopatric and parapatric distribution of haplotype groups and clades. MtDNA lineages are more diverse in E. orbicularis than they are in T. hermanni on southern European peninsulas, indicating several distinct glacial refuges in close proximity and extensive intergradation during Holocene range expansion for E. orbicularis. In T. hermanni it is likely that only on the Balkan Peninsula was more than one refuge located, corresponding to the parapatric ranges of haplotype groups currently there. On the old western Mediterranean islands Corsica and Sardinia no differentiated (E. orbicularis) or only weakly differentiated haplotypes (T. hermanni) occur, even though there is evidence for the presence of both species on Corsica since at least the Middle Pleistocene. High mountain chains constitute major barriers separating distinct mtDNA clades or groups in each species.

AB  - The ultrastructure and cytochemistry of the distal border of the olfactory epithelium was investigated in the Mediterranean tortoise Testudo hermanni (Gmelin).  The olfactory knobs of typical bipolar receptor cells, provided with microvilli and cilia, were found to contain a partly reduced set of axonemal and kinetosomal structures.  Dynein arms and radial spokes were never observed in the cilia; as a rule, basal bodies in the knob cytoplasm lacked feet, and residual striated rootlets were found deep inside the dendrite.  A dense feltwork of thin filaments coated the basal portions of both olfactory microvilli and cilia as well as the free surface of the knob:  this is a thick glycocalix, as suggested by ruthenium red (RR) staining.  A complex pattern of rounded and elongated vesicular profiles (labyrinth), which accumulated beneath the apical plasma membrane, was also observed in the knobs.  Although these vesicles were closely contiguous to the plasmalemma and related caveolar invaginations (impocketings), findings from RR staining excluded any permanent connection between the external environ and labyrinth compartment.
   The degeneration patterns of kinetic specializations and the remarkable glycocalix of the olfactory cell surface exposed to the external environ are discussed in relation to the hypothesis that odorant molecules interact with stereospecific sites in the plasma membranes.  It is assumed that kinetosomal and axonemal structures are conservative features of the ciliated cells ancestral to the bipolar receptor cells, whilst the thick RR positive coat possibly represents a specialization relevant to the selection of molecules, before these interact with the plasma membrane.  Finally, the vesicular profiles contained in the knob cytoplasm are related to the turn-over processes involving the apical plasmalemma:  they could represent newly formed membranous complements from the Golgi bodies or old patches of plasmalemma which will undergo intracytoplasmic autolysis processes.

AB  - Our study confirms that Sicilian and Corso-Sardinian Testudo h. hermanni share a certain mtDNA haplotype, while tortoises from peninsular Italy harbour slightly different haplotypes. When the fossil record is considered, this striking pattern agrees well with the idea of local extinction in Corsica and Sardinia and later replacement by tortoises originating elsewhere, either by natural oversea dispersal or translocation by man.

AB  - Information on the voluntary dry matter (DM) intake, gut passage time and digestibility of nutrients may help the adequate feeding of tortoises and may also help to prevent fast growth rate due to overfeeding of the animals. The aim of the study was to determine the voluntary DM intake and gut transit time in Hermanns tortoises (Testudo hermanni) and also to investigate whether it is possible to determine digestibility with the method of total collection. The twelve male tortoises were placed individually in plastic terrariums. Three different foods (slicing cucumber, lettuce, dandelion) were tested for voluntary DM intake. The DM intake in percentage of the body weight was much higher in case of lettuce than in slicing cucumber or dandelion. Gut transit time was much lower in case of slicing cucumber than in the two other foods. Most of the animals (in all three diets) partially or totally consumed the faeces, so the digestibility could not be determined. According to the results of the study ad libitum feeding of lettuce is not advised. The method of total collection cannot be reliably applied in tortoises

AB  - Although research on habitat use and habitat selection is essential for understanding population ecology and behavior, most such zoological studies have used only general habitat categories describing main habitat features instead of using modem plant ecological approaches. Here, we analyze Testudo hermanni microhabitat use at a coastal Mediterranean site in central Italy by modeling tortoise presence/absence at three spatial scales, using a logistic regression design and quantitative vegetation and plant community analysis to reveal correlates of tortoise habitat use on a fine scale. Our analyses showed that only a few plant species among the many present, and these on a very small spatial scale, are important determinants of tortoise presence and site selection. We also find that tortoises chose a paradoxical combination of high levels of bare soil and high total vegetation cover. This suggests that these tortoises are selecting small patches of habitat in a matrix of less desirable habitat. Our findings also have important implications for habitat management, in that increasing the number of habitat patches containing the few significant plants is likely to be desirable, whereas increasing the size of such patches is probably less relevant.

AB  - Tortoises of the genus Testudo living in Italy are Testudo hermanni, Testudo graeca and Testudo marginata. Although a great deal of information has been acquired on the internal medicine and surgery on these animals, little is known of their parasitological fauna. A survey on the presence of gastro-intestinal parasitic nematodes in tortoises bred in Italy was carried out to acquire extensive epidemiological data. Stool samples of 62 tortoises (37 T. hermanni hermanni, 13 T. graeca, 6 T. hermanni boettgeri and 6 T. marginata) were macroscopically examined and subjected to qualitative (flotation and Baermann techniques) and quantitative (McMaster technique) microscopic examinations. Adult nematodes were identified using morphological keys. Eggs of oxyurids (species indistinguishable) and adults of Alaeuris numidica, Mehdiella microstoma, Mehdiella uncinata, Tachygonetria longicollis, Tachygonetria conica and Tachygonetria palearcticus (Oxyurida, Pharyngodonidae); larvae and adults of Atractis dactyluris (Ascaridida, Atractidae); and eggs and adults of Angusticaecum holopterum (Ascaridida, Ascarididae) were identified in all animals >1 year, whereas all tortoises <1 year of age were parasite-free. Moreover, this study reports for the first time A. numidica and M. microstoma in T. marginata. This work shows that nematodes affecting tortoises are diffused in Italy and highlights the need to investigate their epidemiology more in depth.

AB  - Numerous osmiophilic inclusions, with matrix arranged into concentric lamellae, were found in a zone between the nucleus and the subciliary layer of mitochondria in the apical cytoplasm of ciliated cells of the tracheal epithelium in the wild cat (Felis silvestris) and the tortoise Testudo hermanni.
   Their presence could be related to the existence of the granular endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex in the cells.  Their development by local coiling and condensation of the cytoplasm or by metamoprhosis of mitochondria is also discussed.

AB  - Sighting frequency of tortoises (Testudo hermanni), standardized by the number of person-hours of field effort, was studied between 1992 and 2013 at three different study areas in central Italy. Although the frequency of tortoise sightings fluctuated substantially across years and among study areas, there was a significant declining trend in all the three areas, with GLM analyses showing also a significant interaction between study area and sampling year. The decreasing trend was higher in Castel Fusano than in the other two sites, with yearly frequency of sightings being independent of search effort in all of the study areas. These trends may indicate population declines, because no other explanations seem plausible. Total rainfall from previous autumn to the study period was positively correlated to tortoise sightings in only one locality. The yearly frequency of sightings of juvenile tortoises did not vary significantly among study areas and across years, thus indicating that simple differences in detectability cannot explain the observed patterns. Summer fires and forest overgrowing seem to explain the tortoise decline in two study areas (Castel Fusano and Oriolo) whereas we were not able to identify any specific reason for tortoise decline in the third study area (Manziana).

AB  - The acquisition and consumption of small prey in the pre-Upper Palaeolithic is a highly debated topic at present. For some authors, the systematic obtaining of these animals is only part of the subsistence strategies used by anatomically modern Humans. However, the consumption of small prey dates back to the Plio-Pleistocene chronologies in some sites. Although the utilization of leporids has been recorded in several pre-Late Pleistocene European sites. the evidence of tortoise consumption is documented not as common for these periods. However, Level IV of Bolomor Cave has clear diagnostic elements to document the acquisition and use of tortoises (Testudo hermanni) for food in the form of: (1) cutmarks on limb bones and ventral surface of the carapace and plastron; (2) presence of burning on tortoise skeleton and shell; (3) elements of anthropogenic breakage on carapace and plastron: percussion pits, percussion notches and impact flakes; and (4) human toothmarks on limb bones. This paper tries to examine the possible patterns in the tortoise consumption sequence from Level IV of Bolomor Cave and improves data on the butchery process and tortoise consumption in the Late Middle Pleistocene.

AB  - Optimal foraging theory and diet breadth models often place large mammals in top-ranking positions due to their high-energy return. However, mass collection of small prey can result in comparable return rates, and dietary diversity is nutritionally beneficial on its own right. A growing body of evidence recovered from several sites in the Mediterranean Basin confirms Neanderthal use of small size prey. Slow-moving, tortoises are an easy catch, and human collection and consumption is demonstrated by taphonomic analysis. In Portugal, two key Middle Palaeolithic cave sites, Gruta da Oliveira and Gruta da Figueira Brava, provide pertinent evidence. Based on an improved osteometric method, in which long bone measurements are standardised and analysed together using the Logarithmic Size Index (LSI), it is possible to better gauge the contribution of tortoises to the diet and the human impact on the species' populations, At inland Gruta da Oliveira, a tendency towards the massive collection of tortoises, affecting the local population more severely, is apparent. At coastal Gruta da Figueira Brava, the data suggest opportunistic collection upon encounter, possibly due to the availability of a more diverse range of resources.

AB  - Testudo lunellensis Almera and Bofill, 1903 from the Middle Pleistocene of Cova de Gracia (Park Guell, Barcelona, Spain) is a valid species belonging to the clade of the extant Testudo hermanni - a diagnostic feature being the narrowed vertebral scutes. Thanks to still unpublished material, T. lunellensis is diagnosed for the first time and its shell morphology described in detail. This species is uniquely characterized, among others, by tall peripheral bones and by a peculiar shape of the anterior lobe of the plastron, somewhat recalling the species referred to Testudo s.s. (the clade containing the extant species Testudo graeca, Testudo kleinmanni and Testudo marginata). Given that the purported valid species from Lunel-Viel (Middle Pleistocene, France) is still unnamed and undescribed, T. lunellensis from Cova de Gracia is currently the stratigraphically youngest extinct Testudo species. The co-occurrence in T. lunellensis of characters typical of both T. hermanni and Testudo s.s. further testifies the phenotypic plasticity of tortoises and the mosaic distribution of morphological characters, which hinders a clear-cut assessment of the relationships of extant tortoises when based exclusively on morphology. Further analyses of the phylogeny of Testudo should consider fossil and extant taxa together, as well as both morphological and genetic characters.

AB  - Long-term ecological studies are important for understanding wild populations' dynamics and processes and the actual factors that can determine their decline. Here, we report the results of a 28-years-long (1992-2019) monitoring of three distinct populations of a tortoise, Testudo hermanni. in Central Italy, with an emphasis on their population abundance trends and on the eventual variation in their habitat use across years and among the study areas. Samplings were conducted by Visual Encounter Survey (VIE) methodology, and using a suite of statistical analyses including correlations and Generalized Linear Models analyses. Our data showed a statistically significant decline in tortoise sightings through time, and concurrently also a variation in habitat use by tortoises. In all the three study areas, we observed a significant increase of tortoise sighting frequency in the habitat type characterized by high ( >taller than 200 cm) shrubby and wooded vegetation. Since our analyses revealed no significant change in the habitat type availability by year in each study area, we suggest that T. hermanni was increasingly selecting closed vegetation spots throughout the years. We hypothesize that this observed trend of shift in habitat selection could be due to lowering their body temperatures to prevent overheating. So, the selection of more covered spots would be a thermal ecology adaptive consequence of the ongoing global warming.

AB  - A radiodense area of the left coeloma was found in a greek turtoise (testudo hermanni), admitted to clinical examination because of a paresis of the left forelimb and an increasing dyspnoea. Histopathologically, the space-requiring process proved to be a tubuloalveolar adenocarcinoma, having its origin in the bronchial epithelium. Inside the lung tissue, the growth of the tumour occured expansive and canalicular. On the other hand it infiltrated the peritracheal tissue.
   The cranial margin of the neoplasm reached the acromion scapulae of the left forelimb, leading to the observed paresis.

AB  - The area of dark pigmentation on the plastron of the tortoise Testudo hermanni shows a latitudinal dine over about 400 km in Greece, with populations in the south being darker. The carapace did not show the clinal trend, and pigmentation was not significantly related to longitude or altitude. We examined several possible explanations for the dine, including an effect of incubation temperature, random genetic variation, and adaptation to several environmental variables. The most likely explanation is selection for thermoregulation, with decreased dark pigmentation in the north reducing heat loss to the substrate by infra red radiation during activity. This hypothesis was supported by data on body (T-b) and substrate (T-s) temperatures in populations from northern, central and southern Greece. T-b was generally above T-s, showing that heat would generally be lost rather than gained through the plastron, and the mean difference T-b-T-s was greatest in the north: +6.6 degrees C, compared to +2.4 degrees C in the south. Mean T-b was lowest in the south (26.9 degrees C, compared to 29.3 degrees C in the north) and the slope of T-b on T-s was about 1 (compared to 0.5 in the north). Thermoregulation in southern Greece is similar to that of tropical tortoises, with avoidance of overheating being the major problem, rather than elevation of T-b for activity.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the development and differentiation of steroidogenic cells in the embryonic adrenal gland of Testudo hermanni using histological, histochemical, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural methods. The 26 developmental stages were divided into three periods: early (stages 1-18, up to 20days of incubation), intermediate (stages 19-22, incubation days 21-35) and advanced (stages 23-26, from incubation day 36 to hatching). A small presumptive bud of steroidogenic cells was visible at the end of the early period, protruding into the coelom from the lateral wall of intermediate mesoderm. Ultrastructural characteristics suggested that young and scarcely differentiated cells could already be able to perform steroidogenic activity: lipid droplets, large amount of SER and RER, small rounded mitochondria with variously shaped cristae and dense matrix. The cell membrane showed microvilli and coated pits. During the intermediate period, the interrenal bud deepened into the haemopoietic tissue, close to the mesonephros and the newly formed metanephros. The ultrastructural, immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical characteristics pointed to enhanced steroidogenic activity. The contact with both kidney types (mesonephros and metanephros) continued in the advanced period, and chromaffin cells were also extensively mixed with steroidogenic cells. This is a peculiar feature of chelonian adrenal gland, in comparison with that of other reptiles. The variable cytological characteristics of embryonic steroidogenic cells in the advanced period suggest a four-phase cycle of steroidogenic activity.

AB  - The plasma concentration of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol was measured in 13 adult Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni), seven adult spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) and two adult marginated tortoises (Testudo marginata) during 2004. They were healthy, of both sexes, and kept in captivity under natural unfiltered sunlight in southern England with no dietary sources of cholecalciferol. Blood samples were taken in March, June and August, and the concentration of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol did not vary significantly with the seasons. However, the concentrations in the female tortoises were always significantly lower than in the males.

AB  - Objective To assess the agreement between point-of-care and laboratory analysers in measuring biochemical and blood gas analytes in venous samples from tortoises and to define preliminary reference intervals for venous blood gas analysis in Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni).
   Materials and Methods Jugular venous blood samples from 47 Hermann's tortoises underwent paired analysis with a portable gas analyser (i-STAT 1, Abaxis), a portable chemical analyser (VetScan VS2, Abaxis), and with the respective reference analysers. Agarose gel electrophoresis was used to determine albumin concentrations on 12 specimens. Agreement was evaluated with Bland-Altman plots and regression analysis using the Passing-Bablok method.
   Results Point-of-care analysers had variable agreement with the reference analysers, presenting constant or proportional bias depending on the analyte. Relevant analytes in reptiles, such as ionised and total calcium, had acceptable agreement. The method for determining albumin concentration currently available in both point-of-care and laboratory analysers significantly overestimated albumin concentrations as compared to protein electrophoresis.
   Clinical Significance While the use of POC analysers is extremely advantageous in small animal primary care facilities, agreement between point-of-care and laboratory analysers varies depending on the analyte. For certain analytes, interchangeability of results is limited and specific reference intervals for point-of-care analysers are required. Veterinarians should be aware of the size and the direction of the bias of each analyte.

AB  - The generic diagnosis of Alaeuris is emended based on the study and redescription of Alaeuris numidica from the cecum of Testudo graeca collected in Settat, Morocco and of Testudo hermanni collected in Catalonia, Spain. Scanning electron microscopy studies revealed that the papillar previously described as adanal are simple lobes because of the lack of terminal nerves, and that both preanal and postanal papillae are pedunculate. These new findings allowed us to emend the diagnosis of the genus and the species. A list of species of Alaeuris with biogeographic regions and hosts is provided.

AB  - Three species of tortoise (Testudinidae) occur in Greece (Testudo hermanni, T. graeca and the endemic T. marginata), all of which have been listed as rare or vulnerable. This paper describes the current situation of 75 populations that were last observed in the 1970s and 1980s and described in 1989. Twenty-nine populations had declined in density and/or status (significantly more than had improved), 10 of which were functionally extinct. A particularly notable loss was a dense population of T. marginata at Gytheion in the Peloponnese due to a widespread fire. Declining populations were significantly associated with identified high threat in 1989 and with close proximity to human settlement. There were no significant effects of tortoise species, area of site, characteristics of surrounding areas or original density on these changes. Declines were less associated with agriculture than predicted in 1989, reflecting changing economic conditions in Greece in the 1990s. Continuing threats to tortoise habitats make their long-term future appear bleak outside of protected areas. The risk of extinction from stochastic variation in small populations was also assessed, using the VORTEX program. This risk was much lower than that from habitat loss; 60-96% of populations of 100 tortoises would survive for 1000 years, depending on adult body size, compared to only 0-0.02% of habitats. The high survival potential of small populations would facilitate conservation of the high intraspecific diversity of tortoises in Greece.

AB  - Body mass and length data from large samples of wild Testudo graeca, T. hermanni and T. marginata in Greece were used to assess body mass condition. Mass-length relationships differed significantly between the sexes (females being heavier) and among the species (T. marginata being least heavy). Mass-length relationships for each species and sex were used to calculate the condition index (CI) log (MMt), where M is observed mass and M' is mass predicted from length, which is equal to residuals from the regression of log M on log length. It was possible to use the empirical mass-length relationships from one population of T. hermanni to calculate CI in other populations of substantially different adult size. The seasonal pattern of the CI varied with latitude, with a sharper and later peak further north, and habitat, declining more in summer at a xeric coastal site. The seasonal patterns of CI in T. graeca and T. marginata were similar, with sharper and later peaks compared to T. hermanni. These seasonal patterns of CI were related to differences in activity and food availability among species and sites. The variability of the CI was similar in all three species, with most values between -0.1 and +0.1; seasonal variation was of relatively low amplitude, with a range of about 0.05 between the highest and lowest monthly means.

AB  - The impact of fire and mechanical habitat destruction on a population of the tortoise Testudo hermanni in northern Greece varied with vegetation type and season. A major fire in summer 1980 caused low ( < 5%) mortality of sexable tortoises ( > 10 cm) in coastal heath, highest (about 50%) mortality in grassland, and intermediate levers in dry heath. Mechanical habitat destruction caused about 50% mortality in affected areas. Mortality of juveniles was greater than that of sexable animals. Overall, the 1980 catastrophe was more damaging than previously thought, causing a 64% decrease in the total size of the Alyki main heath population. A localized summer fire in 1986 caused a similar level and pattern of mortality to that of 1980, but a spring fire in 1988 had little effect on the tortoise population. A fire and mechanical habitat destruction in winter 1989/90 caused only a 14% decrease in population size; mortality was again concentrated in grassland areas, but affected juveniles and sexable animals equally. Variation of mortality with season suggests that any burning needed for habitat management at tortoise sites should occur in winter or early spring. Juveniles were undersampled by 3-4 times compared to sexable animals. their number increased greatly by 1990, reaching the same proportion as in the original population. There was, however, no recovery in the number of sexable tortoises in the decade after the 1980 catastrophe. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary Animal health is directly linked to viability of the population, which may be affected by anthropogenic activities and diseases. Biomarkers such as serum chemistry and parameters of oxidative balance are good indicators of an overall biological status, providing information on the effects of contaminants on the organism. The objective of this work was to analyze biochemical and molecular indicators and their correlations to biogenic and risk elements in Testudo hermanni. Biochemical parameters were analyzed using the commercial kit DiaSys and biochemical analyzer Randox RX Monza. Sodium, potassium, and chlorides were measured using the EasyLite analyzer. Oxidative stress was evaluated using colorimetric and luminometric methods. Quantification of chemical elements in the animal blood was carried out using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Biochemical values of analyzed samples from Hermann's tortoises were almost the same as referential values described by multiple authors, with minor aberrations in the total protein parameter. Values of arsenic (As) and nickel (Ni) showed correlation with biochemical parameters and the parameters of oxidative stress. Cadmium (Cd) exhibited correlation with the biochemical parameter aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Finally, this study detected heavy metals and their significant correlations with selected biochemical and molecular parameters in Hermann's tortoises. Background: Conservation of species diversity is the need of the hour for preserving life forms on Earth. Extinction of any part of the ecosystem has negative impacts on many processes and systems. The objective of this work was to analyze some biochemical and molecular indicators and their correlations to biogenic elements and heavy metals in Testudo hermanni (n = 16). Methods: Biochemical parameters were analyzed using the commercial kit DiaSys and biochemical analyzer Randox RX Monza. Sodium, potassium, and chlorides were measured using the EasyLite analyzer. Oxidative stress was evaluated using colorimetric and luminometric methods. Quantification of chemical elements in the blood was carried out using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPS). Results: Biochemical values of analyzed samples from Hermann's tortoises were almost the same as referential values described by multiple authors, with minor aberrations in the total protein parameter. Values of arsenic (As) and nickel (Ni) showed correlation with biochemical parameters and the parameters of oxidative stress. Cadmium (Cd) exhibited correlation with aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Conclusions: This study reports correlations among four heavy metals, and their levels were again correlated with biochemical and molecular parameters in Hermann's tortoises.

AB  - Electrophoresis is a useful diagnostic tool for the detection of shifts in plasma protein fractions, which can be associated with a variety of diseases. This method is not often used in reptile medicine because there are only a few studies available and no reference intervals have been published for most species. The goal of this study was to establish reference intervals for plasma capillary zone electrophoresis in Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) under consideration of variations by season and sex. 251 samples from healthy adult Hermann's tortoises were collected from May 2016 to October 2017. Total protein was measured by the biuret method and albumin was measured twice by bromocresol green dye-binding method (BCG) and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) in order to compare the detection methods. The globulin fractions were analyzed by CZE. Seasonal variations were significant for total protein (P = 0.0055), albumin (P = 0.0322) and alpha-globulins (P = 0.0007). The variations between male and female Hermann's tortoises were highly significant for albumin (P < 0.0001), alpha-globulins (P < 0.0001) and beta-globulins (P < 0.0001). The differences between the measurements of albumin by CZE and BCG also differed depending on the sex and season. This study demonstrates that it is important to include the variations by sex and season when establishing reference intervals and interpreting results. Furthermore, it confirms the importance of using electrophoresis for the correct determination of albumin in tortoises.

AB  - Objective-To determine the pharmacokinetics of cefovecin sodium after SC administration to Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni).
   Animals-23 healthy adult Hermann's tortoises (15 males and 8 females).
   Procedures-Cefovecin (8.0 mg/kg) was injected once in the subcutis of the neck region of Hermann's tortoises, and blood samples were obtained at predetermined time points. Plasma cefovecin concentrations were measured via ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated with a noncompartmental model. Plasma protein concentration was quantified, and the percentage of cefovecin bound to protein was estimated with a centrifugation technique.
   Results-Cefovecin was absorbed rapidly, reaching maximum plasma concentrations between 35 minutes and 2 hours after administration, with the exception of 1 group, in which it was reached after 4 hours. The mean +/- SD time to maximum concentration was 1.22 +/- 1.14 hours; area under the concentration-time curve was 220.35 +/- 36.18 h center dot mu g/mL The mean protein-bound fraction of cefovecin ranged from 41.3% to 47.5%. No adverse effects were observed.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Administration of a single dose of cefovecin SC appeared to be well-tolerated in this population of tortoises. Results of pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that the 2-week dosing interval suggested for dogs and cats cannot be considered effective in tortoises; however, further research is needed to determine therapeutic concentrations of the drug and appropriate dose ranges.

AB  - Feeding is of crucial importance in the maintenance of a species, especially in the case of long life expectancy species as Chelonian. A mistake or an inadequacy of feeding supply with nutritional needs can lead to growth disorders or life-threatening disease predisposition. The only recommendations available to owners generally consist of a list of fruit and vegetables, selected on the basis of their calcium/phosphorus ratio. To develop a diet that meets herbivorous tortoises needs, it is necessary to take into account the characteristic of digestion and their adequate requirements in nutrients.

AB  - Clinical health checks including blood testing before brumation in fall are an important tool in reptile medicine and help to reduce the risk of complications during brumation. Electrophoresis may be useful for the evaluation of liver cell function and the detection of antigenic stimulation. The goal of this study was to compare species-specific reference intervals for plasma chemistry analytes and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) for a variety of pet chelonian species in fall. Lithium heparinized samples were collected from 68 clinically healthy spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca), 79 red-eared sliders (Trachemys scnpta elegans), and 30 map turtles (Graptemys spp.) from September to November 2016 and 2017. During the same period, 128 equivalent samples were collected from Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) and the obtained data was used for comparison. Chemistry analytes were measured from plasma using an autoanalyzer and electrophoresis was carried out by CZE. Significant variations (P < 0.0001) between the species were found for several analytes including total protein, percent albumin, and albumin : globulin ratio, alpha-, beta-, and gamma-globulin, alkaline phosphatase, glutamate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bile acids, creatine kinase, urea, uric acid, inorganic phosphorus, total calcium, and potassium. The variations in albumin (g/l) measured by CZE were also significant (P = 0.0064). No significant variations were detected for sodium levels. The results demonstrate the importance of species-specific reference intervals and provide reference intervals for the plasma chemistry and capillary zone electrophoresis in three chelonian species.

AB  - The basic principles of hematology used in mammalian medicine can be applied to reptiles. The appearances of the blood cells are significantly different from those seen in most mammals, and vary with taxa and staining method used. Many causes for abnormalities of the reptilian hemogram are similar to those for mammals, although additional factors such as venipuncture site, season, hibernation status, captivity status, and environmental factors can also affect values, making interpretation of hematologic results challenging. Values in an individual should be compared with reference ranges specific to that species, gender, and environmental conditions when available.

AB  - Objective-To determine intraocular pressure (IOP) in healthy Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni).
   Animals-26 outdoor-housed Hermann's tortoises (13 males and 13 females); body weight ranged from 255 to 2,310 g, and age ranged from 4 to > 50 years.
   Procedures-After a preliminary ophthalmic evaluation was performed, IOP was measured by means of a rebound tonometer in both eyes of each tortoise. Three measurements were obtained for each eye; successive measurements were obtained from alternate eyes. Each measurement was based on the mean of 6 values automatically provided by the rebound tonometer. Statistical analysis was used to evaluate correlations between variables and to identify sex- or size-related IOP variations, and changes in IOP over multiple measurements.
   Results-Mean +/- SEM IOP of the 52 eyes was 15.74 +/- 0.20 mm Hg (range, 9 to 22 mm Hg). Results for t tests did not reveal significant differences in IOP between the right and left eyes or between males and females. A significant moderate negative correlation (r = -0.41; r(2) = 0.169) between IOP and body weight was detected. Results of repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant increase in IOP over multiple measurements.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Rebound tonometry was a practical and rapid means of determining IOP in small- to medium-sized tortoises that required minimal manual restraint of the animals. Establishing IOP values in healthy Hermann's tortoises will provide a reference frame for use during complete ophthalmic examinations, thus allowing clinicians to diagnose a broader spectrum of ocular pathological conditions in tortoises.

AB  - Chelonid herpesvirus (ChHV) infection in tortoises associated with stomatitis-rhinitis complex is a severe, mostly epizootic disease characterized by proliferative and diphtheroid-necrotizing glossitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, and tracheitis, often occurring with pneumonia and encephalitis. The UL5 gene from a German ChNV isolate was used to generate a digoxigenin-labeled 307-base-pair DNA probe by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). ChHV DNA was detected in paraffin-embedded tissues of five naturally infected tortoises (two Afghan tortoises [Testudo horsefieldii], USA; two Hermann's tortoises [Testudo hermanni], Switzerland; one T. hermanni, Germany) by means of in situ hybridization (ISH) and PCR. Distribution of ChHV DNA exhibits many characteristics of alphaherpesvirus but also some characteristics of betaherpesvirus infections. The amino acid sequence of a portion of the ChHV UL5 homolog exhibited more than 50% similarity to alphaherpesvirus UL5 proteins. Nuclear hybridization signals were detected in epithelial cells of the lingual mucosa and glands. Furthermore, ChHV DNA was observed in tracheal epithelium, pneumocytes, hepatocytes, the renal tubular epithelium, cerebral glia cells and neurons, and intramural intestinal ganglia. ChHV DNA in endothelial cells of many organs underlines the systemic character of the disease. Importantly, ChHV DNA was detected by ISH in multiple tissues of tortoises originating from different geographic provenances. This indicates a high degree of conservation of the UL5 gene fragment among viruses prevalent in tortoises on different continents. With the described ISH, a molecular biological tool is available for rapid and specific diagnosis of ChHV infections and, Inert: importantly, comparative pathogenetic studies of ChHV isolates from geographically unrelated regions.

AB  - Captive reptiles often show higher growth rates than in the wild, possibly due to higher feeding intensity. Although health problems are usually linked to inappropriate diets, fast growth itself, such as triggered by appropriate diets fed in high amounts, has traditionally also been considered unfavorable for tortoises. We document growth rates (based on age and mass) from private Testudo hermanni and T. graeca breeders, which are generally higher than those reported for free-ranging specimens, but show enormous variation. Tortoise patients presented to an exotics clinic also covered the whole growth rate spectrum. To test whether fast growth was associated with diseases, the agebody mass relationship of these patients was tested, in a retrospective evaluation, for additional influence factors, such as dietary history and occurrence of certain diet and growth-related diseases. No indication was found that animals particularly heavy for their age were more prone to diet/growth-related disorders. In general, tortoises fed diets with meat/grain were heavier for their age than tortoises fed more appropriate diets; dietary history was not related to a particular disease. The results suggest the agebody mass relationship may not be suitable for testing effects of fast growth; an agebody length relationship would be more appropriate. Animals presented for a diet/growth-related disorder were younger than animals presented for other reasons; there was a significant negative correlation between the severity of pyramiding and age, suggesting that growth-related disorders may well limit the life expectancy of tortoises. Controlled clinical studies are required to fully test this hypothesis. Zoo Biol. 31:705-717, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Seventeen populations of T. hermanni in Greece differed substantially in mean adult body size? over a range of about one and a half times in length and three times in mass. Females were the larger sex in all populations: the degree of sexual size dimorphism did not vary with mean body size. The proximate cause of the variation of body size among populations was differences in the duration of growth, rather than egg or hatchling size or the growth rates of juveniles. The age at maturity (alpha) increased with body size in the 17 populations. while the Bertalanffy growth constant (li) decreased with body size. The quantities alpha M and M/k (where M is the instantaneous mortality rate) were invariant with body size, suggesting that differences between populations were adaptive rather than the result of short-term disturbance. Body size was greater in cooler areas. and increased with both latitude and altitude. This pattern is opposite to that found in most ectotherms (the reverse Bergmann's rule), and to that which occurs between tortoise species. Several hypotheses about the possible ultimate causes of variation of body size were rejected, including adaptation to long-term habitat disturbance (land use), character displacement, social factors, energetics, thermoregulation, r-K selection, the length of the season available for incubation, or differences in juvenile mortality. The most likely ultimate cause of size variation between sites is differences in adult mortality, the correlation with environmental temperature being through the frequency of fires.

AB  - Physical limits of speed performances impose strong selective pressures on animals, influencing important functions such as predator avoidance and foraging success. Armoured herbivorous species such as tortoises represent a peculiar case: features that optimise encounter rate during reproduction, the ability to reach favourable sites for thermoregulation and resting, foraging or nesting sites may be more important than running speed. To explore this issue, we measured three characteristics related to travelling ability but that are independent of running speed: (1) muscular strength, (2) time needed for overturning and (3) jumping from a high step as proxies of the ability to overcome various obstacles. Additionally, reaction times in tortoises placed in a normal or overturned position were measured as a proxy of antipredator response. More than 400 adult Hermann's tortoises from six populations were tested in the field during two seasons. Measures of travelling ability and antipredator response varied markedly among populations, and thus with environmental characteristics such as habitat type, terrain ruggedness and presence of predators. Tortoises from rugged and hot habitats (e.g. Mediterranean macchia) were the most successful and the fastest to accomplish the tests. Overturned tortoises were more reluctant to start moving compared to those in normal position, but this effect was absent in the two localities free from predators. Sex and season had limited effect on the measured performances. Overall, locomotor features essentially varied with environmental constraints. Future environmental studies should explore whether the observed differences among populations are linked to genetic adaptation or phenotypic plasticity.
   Significance statement
   Locomotor performances crucially influence habitat use, foraging and reproductive success, thus directly affecting individual fitness. Although running speed is often considered as a main indicator of agility, in armoured terrestrial vertebrates some other agility components might be more important. Heavy, rigid armour imposes trade-off between protection of soft body parts and locomotor performances and consequently habitat use. This study compiles three tests of locomotor performance which might be important for overcoming various obstacles present in mosaic habitats of tortoises. Testing adult Hermann's tortoises from six populations with various habitat characteristics, we found significant inter-population differences. The ability of tortoises to complete the tests positively correlates with climatic conditions and topography of their habitats. Additionally, presence of predators in the habitats dramatically affects tortoise's antipredator behaviour. Measured locomotor performances and antipredator behaviour showed surprisingly low level of sexual dimorphism.

AB  - We studied microhabitat use by the threatened Malagasy endemic spider tortoise (Pyxis arachnoides) during the wet and the dry season of Madagascar's Southern Dry Forest. In total, 282 tortoises were captured and marked. Microhabitat selection was dependent on the interaction term 'age x sex' (with curved carapace length as a covariate), but neither dependent on season, sex and age taken independently. Juveniles favoured areas of denser vegetation cover than more mature animals, which typically selected the microhabitat types in relation to their relative availability. Controlling the subsistence harvest of fuel wood within the region is an important conservation initiative to increase the recruitment of reproductively mature tortoises into the population.

AB  - Although body coloration is often used in social interactions, few studies have tested whether it is linked to a suite of behavioural traits. We examined whether among captive adult male eastern Hermann's tortoises, Eurotestudo boettgeri, behavioural patterns covary with eumelanic coloration of the shell. Dark eumelanic males were more aggressive in male-male confrontations and bolder towards humans. These relationships were independent of body size and ambient temperature. Activity level and exploration were not significantly associated with coloration. We conclude that, at least in captivity, melanic shell coloration predicts agonistic behaviour towards conspecifics and fearfulness towards humans (i.e. boldness).

AB  - The new genus is created to include the species of the hermanni group, which is within Testudo s.l., a Palearctic genus, consequently separated from both Testudo s.s. and Agrionemys. A preliminary cladistic analysis of the osteological characters, including fossil species, demonstrated the splitting of the three lineages, probably since the Oligocene and surely at the Upper Miocene. Diagnosis of the new genus is based on a collection of features. The main stages of evolution leading to the three lineages are provided. We also describe external characters of the extant species that could be considered as diagnostic. However, phylogenetic relationships between genera are not definitively established.

AB  - Previous data have shown that the Former Yugoslavia had a significant role in exports of land tortoises (Testudo spp.) during the past century. In this paper we present historical exploitation and compare dynamics of the trade in land tortoises in the former Yugoslavia according to Federal Statistical Office and Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) database. Also we examine impact of long-term harvesting on the health of populations by calculating the condition index (CI) in the sample populations of the most common tortoise in the former Yugoslavia (Testudo hermanni). According to the Federal Statistical Office's records of international trade, a total of 2615 metric tonnes of tortoises (T. hermanni and T. graeca) were exported from the Former Yugoslavia within a 41-year period during the 20th century. These exports represented a total of 2.142 million specimens. The quantities of tortoises exported peaked at a value of 236 tons in 1972. Since 1929, tortoises have been exported to 19 countries. The largest importers were Germany, Italy, Belgium-Luxembourg and Great Britain. These countries accounted for 77% of the total exports. We found many discrepancies between official Federal records and CITES records for the period from 1975 onwards. Differences were found in the quantities exported, the identities of the importing counties and their relative shares of the total export of tortoises. The current optimal CI values in examined tortoises suggest a response to overharvesting through density-dependent processes. The paper discusses a current situation in tortoise farming and trade and further perspectives on conservation of tortoise populations in the region of the former Yugoslavia.

AB  - Objective-To determine the effect of various UVB radiation sources on plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D-3 concentrations in Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni).
   Animals-18 healthy Hermann's tortoises.
   Procedures-Tortoises were exposed to sunlight in an outdoor enclosure located in the natural geographic range of Hermann's tortoises (n = 6 tortoises) or a self-ballasted mercury-vapor lamp (6) or fluorescent UVB-emitting lamp (6) in an indoor enclosure for 35 days. Plasma samples were obtained from each tortoise on the first (day 0) and last (day 35) days of the study, and concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D-3 were determined. Amount of UVB radiation in enclosures was measured.
   Results-Mean +/- SD plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D-3 concentrations for tortoises exposed to the mercury-vapor and fluorescent lamps were significantly lower on day 35 (155.69 +/- 80,71 nmol/L and 134.42 +/- 51.42 nmol/L, respectively) than they were on day 0 (368.02 +/- 119.34 nmol/L and 313.69 +/- 109.54 nmol/L, respectively). Mean +/- SD plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin 03 concentration for tortoises exposed to sunlight did not differ significantly between days 0 (38774 +/- 114.56 nmol/L) and 35 (411.51 +/- 189.75 nmol/L). Mean day 35 plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D-3 concentration was significantly higher for tortoises exposed to sunlight versus those exposed to mercury-vapor or fluorescent lamps. Sunlight provided significantly more UVB radiation than did the mercury-vapor or fluorescent lamps.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D-3 concentrations differed between tortoises exposed to sunlight and those exposed to artificial UVB sources. Exposure to sunlight at a latitude similar to that of the natural geographic range is recommended for healthy and calcium-deficient tortoises. (Am J Vet Res 2012;73:1781-1786)

AB  - The aim of the investigations was to draw up reference blood values of European tortoises, which are more and more frequent patients in veterinary practice. Blood samples were taken from the Vena jugularis from 229 clinically healthy adult European tortoises, belonging to the species Testudo hermanni, T. graeca, T. marginata and Agrionemys horsfieldii. Blood samples were taken during the period of a year. The following 31 parameters were examined (results = mean value +/- standard deviation): haemoglobin (7.84 +/- 1.86 g/dl), PCV (28.0 +/- 6.1%), red cell count (0.63 +/- 0.19 x 10(6)/mul) and white cell count (8.73 +/- 6.86 x 10(3)/mul) including differentiation of lymphocytes, heterophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, calcium (8.7 +/- 6.7 mg/dl), magnesium (5.1 +/- 2.5 mg/dl), phosphorus (5.1 +/- 3.1 mg/dl), alkaline phosphatase (445 +/- 293 IU/l), alanine aminotransferase (22 +/- 18 IU/l), aspartate aminotransferase (108 +/- 79 IU/l), gamma-glutamyltansferase (0 IU/l), lactate dehydrogenase (1433 +/- 1029 IU/l), creatine kinase (1156 +/- 1379 IU/l), amylase (190 +/- 96 IU/l), lipase (57 +/- 42 IU/l), glucose (67.9 +/- 38.1 mg/dl), total protein (4.6 +/- 1.6 mg/dl), albumin (1.6 +/- 0.8 mg/dl), globulin (2.9 mg/dl), urea (18.1 +/- 55.9 mg/dl), uric acid (3.2 +/- 1.9 mg/dl), ammonia (519 +/- 314 mu mol/l), creatinine (0.14 +/- 0.15 mg/dl), cholesterol (141 +/- 70 mg/dl), triglycerides (285 +/- 264 mg/dl) and total bilirubin (0 mg/dl). Nine parameters showed statistically significant differences between sexes. 14 parameters showed more or less clearly distinct statistically significant seasonal variations. Species specific variations occurred in 11 parameters. 20 parameters were influenced by the conditions of husbandry. Blood samples may yield valuable information especially on infections, renal and liver disease in tortoises.

AB  - Objective: Male tortoises in captivity are often aggressive against other males or females, in particular during mating season related to hormonal influences (testosterone). Castration in males is the treatment of choice in many vertebrate species. A novel technique of minimal invasive castration is presented for Herman's tortoises (Testudo hermanni). Material and methods: The procedure was performed in ten mature males. An endoscope (2.7 mm/30 degrees angled) was inserted into a prefemoral incision on each side. The testicle was resected after ligation of the gubernaculum testis and the spermatic cord using hemoclips. Results: Each testicle could be removed in approximately 20 minutes. Complications like hemorrhage or damage of adjacent tissue did not occur and all animals recovered uneventfully. Conclusions and clinical relevance: Using the bilateral prefemoral entrance offers an alternative option for orchiectomy in Herman's tortoises without dissection of the shell. Thus complications like hemorrhage or impaired wound healing followed by sequestration of the bone flap are prevented. Because of the anatomical settings and the risk of tissue damage and time consumption, a unilateral approach is not recommended. Fasting the animals is necessary due to the voluminous gastrointestinal tract of this herbivorous tortoise and emptying the urinary bladder provides more space for manipulations in the coelomic cavity and prevents clipping and cutting of adjacent organs. The magnification via the endoscope is beneficial for orientation in the coelomic cavity, which is formed by the extremely convex carapace. Without this equipment it is challenging to visualize the dorsocaudally located gonads through the relatively small incision and the inserted instruments might block the view at the surgical field. Administration of hemoclips achieved a good hennostasis and the testicles could be resected without major blood loss. The described technique is a gentle method for resection of the testicles in this species and can be adapted to other European tortoise species of equal size.

AB  - Objective-To assess dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for evaluating effects of diet and environment on bone mineral density in Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni).
   Animals-26 Hermann's tortoises within 1 month after hatching.
   Procedures-Group 1 was housed in an artificial setting and fed naturally growing vegetation. Group 2 was housed in an artificial setting and fed vegetables grown for human consumption. Group 3 was maintained in an outside enclosure and fed naturally growing vegetation. After 10 months, pyramidal growth, body weight, and adverse conditions were assessed. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the axial and appendicular skeleton, shell, vertebral column, and pelvis was measured via DXA.
   Results-Group 2 had the highest mean +/- SD body weight (65.42 +/- 30.85 g), followed by group 1 (51.08 +/- 22.92 g) and group 3 (35.74 +/- 7.13 g). Mean BMD of the shell varied significantly among groups (group 1, 0.05 +/- 0.03 g/cm(2).m; group 2, 0.09 +/- 0.15 g/cm(2).m; and group 3, undetectable). The BMD of the axial and appendicular skeleton, vertebral column, and pelvis did not differ significantly among groups. Pyramidal growth was highest in group 1 and not evident in group 3.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Tortoises raised in artificial conditions did not have deficits in BMD, compared with results for outdoor-housed hibernating tortoises. Supplemental calcium was apparently not necessary when an adequate photothermal habitat and plant-based diet were provided. Higher BMD of captive-raised tortoises was morphologically associated with a higher incidence of pyramidal growth in captive-raised groups. (Am J Vet Res 2013;74:918-924)

AB  - Two new species of pinworm parasites of Testudo graeca Linnaeus, 1758 from Morocco are described: Tachygonetria marocana n. sp. and T khallaayounei n. sp. Light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies revealed morphological differences in the structure of the male caudal end and cephalic end, which enabled us to differentiate these new species from the others, and from each other. The following taxa are redescribed: T numidica c Seurat, 1918, T longicollis longicollis (Schneider, 1866), T. l. setosa Petter, 1966, T. l. pusilla Petter, 1966 (parasite of Testudo graeca from Morocco), T. macrolaimus palearcticus Petter, 1966 (parasite of Testudo graeca from Morocco and of Testudo hermanni Gmelin, 1789 from Spain). On the basis of morphology, the subspecies were raised to species level.

AB  - Wildfires are common disturbances that have a major impact on ecosystems. Recent decades have seen an increase in fire frequency and extension due to the combined effects of climate change and land-use history. We studied the taxonomic and functional response of a reptile assemblage to repeated fires in southern France to understand shifts in dominant species and diversity, as well as the mechanisms that underlie responses according to functional traits of species. In the spring of 2010, we sampled reptiles in areas with three types of fire regime: unburned, burned once (2003) and burned 4-5 times (last fire in 2003) along a fire history of 51-years period. With this field sampling design, we examined the intermediate disturbance hypothesis and the habitat accommodation model of succession as methods to predict reptile responses to natural fire regimes. We also compared habitat structure at the study area between 1944 and 2006 to certify that repeated-fire regimes have modified the habitat for reptiles. The comparison of the habitat structure between both periods demonstrated that repeated-fire regimes modified the landscape from a homogeneous sparse forest to a contrasted heterogeneous mixture of scrubland and dense forest. We found a loss of reptile diversity after one and multiple fires, a result that contradicts the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Reptile composition differed among the three fire regimes: there was a shift in dominant species and a reduction of beta diversity related to an increase in the number of fires. We also observed a functional response to repeated fires, with an increased frequency of insectivorous reptiles, which live in open areas, are specialists in their ecological niche, and have a short lifespan. These results suggest that reptile replacement according to fire regime accounts for a habitat accommodation model following particular traits of species. Our study indicated that areas subjected to repeated fires have a more strictly Mediterranean reptile assemblage than unburned areas, due to the ability of Mediterranean species to survive thermal environments in open (burned) areas. At a regional scale, changes in dominant species between unburned and repeatedly burned areas might be an argument for maintaining a patchwork of areas burned at variable intervals. However, the increase in fire frequency and extension suggests a future scenario of extinction for species negatively impacted by fire, such as the endangered Hermann's tortoise Testudo hermanni, for which the study area is home to one of the last native populations in the western Mediterranean.

AB  - We report the results of standardized surveys to determine Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) direct mortality and injury as a result of the 2020 Cottonwood Trail Fire in the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, Utah. We encountered 14 tortoise remains attributed to fire, one fire-injured tortoise, and three live tortoises within a 250-ha area of burned tortoise habitat. We used an infrared-equipped trail camera to monitor the health of a fire-injured tortoise at a burrow site. The camera recorded the first observation of a desert woodrat (Neotoma lepida) feeding on a live, fire-injured desert tortoise. We hypothesize that desert woodrat carnivory of fire-injured tortoises in burrows might contribute to indirect (and undetected) firerelated tortoise mortality.

AB  - Testudo hermanni is a protected terrestrial turtle, the geographical distribution of which is discontinuous around the Mediterranean sea, and reduced to three relictual areas in France (Alberes, Maures, Corse).  The knowledge of the embryonic stages is necessary for a determination of the sensitive stages to mortality in the stock farmings.  The developmental stages described here deal with the most eastern subspecies T. hermanni boettgeri, whose individuals are kept in captivity at the station of observation and protection of the Maures turtle (S.O.P.T.O.M.) at Gonfaron (Var).  Indeed, this turtle must not be reintroduced in France, where natural populations of T. hermanni hermanni are living.  The embryos of T. hermanni boettgeri came from thirty three clutches.  The eggs were incubated at 28-degrees-C in the SOPTOM laboratory.  Twenty six stages are described between egg-laying and hatching.  These stages are comparable to those described for the freshwater turtle, Chelydra serpentina (Yntema, 1968).  Some minor peculiarties, detected at the last stages, concern the scale system for the tail and the limbs.  The development of the terminal claw of the tail, which constitutes a morphological characteristic for the species, is described for the first time.  The small axis of the egg generally coincids with the antero-posterior axis of the embryo.  This tends to limit the length extension of the embryo, whereas the great axis of the egg allows a width extension of the embryo.  Just before hatching, the carapace width is greater than its length.  In spite of these peculiarities, the complete study of the embryonic development, carried out for the first time in a terrestrial form, confirms the great homogeneity of Chelonians.  This homogeneity was already suggested by the comparison between the developmental stages of leatherback sea turtles and other aquatic turtles (Renous et al., 1989).

AB  - In spring 2011, high mortality in association with skin lesions, systemic haemorrhages and necrosis occurred in a group of green striped tree dragons (Japalura splendida) which were imported from southwestern China via Florida to Germany. Infections with various endoparasites were diagnosed in coprological examinations. Different antiparasitic and antibiotic treatments over a period of three months did not reduce the mortality rate. The remaining animals were therefore euthanased and submitted for additional testing. Predominant findings in pathological examination were granulomatous and necrotising inflammation of the skin, vacuolar tubulonephrosis of the distal renal tubules, hyperaemia and liver necrosis. Eosinophilic intranuclear and basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies were detected in the liver. Virological testing (PCR and virus isolation methods) demonstrated the presence of ranavirus, adenovirus and invertebrate iridovirus.

AB  - Demographic analyses suggest that chelonians will have a low ability to withstand harvesting, although most have been based on stationary or declining populations. In contrast to this prediction, a population of Testudo graeca grew at the instantaneous rate r = 0.137 from 1980-1990, with a doubling time of 5 years. r was similar in both adult and 10 cm animals, showing that this high rate was not due to changes in population structure, and may thus be taken as an intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)). r(m) was higher than that of most large mammals, and suggests that sustainable harvesting would be a viable conservation strategy for chelonians if tightly regulated. Ranching or farming operations for chelonians would be even more likely to succeed, given their high fecundity. A resumption of trade in Mediterranean tortoises is, however, unlikely to be economically sustainable.

Five of the turtles died. Clinical signs included Cutaneous abscessation. oral ulceration or abscessation (or both), respiratory distress. anorexia. and lethargy. The predominant postmortem lesion was fibrinoid vasculitis of various organs. including skin. mucous membranes, lungs, and liver. No inclusion bodies were detected by histopathology or electron microscopy of formalin-fixed tissue. An iridovirus was isolated front tissues obtained postmortem from two of the box turtles that died. The virus was characterized by electron microscopy. polymerase chain reaction. and sequence analysis of a portion of the major capsid protein as a member of the genus Ranavirus.

The following taxa were redescribed: Tachygonetria conica (Drasche, 1883) and T. robust a (Drasche, 1883) (both from the large intestine of Testudo graeca collected in Settat, Morocco); the subspecies Tachygonetria conica nicollei (Seurat, 1918) is suppressed. A new species, T. combesi n. sp. is described from the large intestine of Testudo hermanni, which confirms the revision of the genus. Scanning electron microscopical studies revealed substantial interspecific differences in the structure of the caudal end.

AB  - The patient had been diagnosed with renal insufficiency and hepatic lipidosis. A method had to be found to support the patient, providing fluids, nutrition and drug therapies. Standard oesophagostomy tube placement was not tolerated by the patient(1). The tortoise kept removing the tube. An alternative method of delivering nutritional support, fluids and medical treatment was sought. No references were found indicating this is a novel method. The tube was fitted under general anaesthetic, through a 4-mm-diameter hole that was created in the second pleural scute above the bridge on the left side of the carapace. The hole in the carapace was filled using dental acrylic (Centri Base, WHW Plastics) and has only had to be replaced once in 18 months after placement.

AB  - In former times research focused on viruses which could be pathogen for mammals, for example arboviruses, Since the late 70ies it is known that viral infections may lead to severe losses in reptile collections. Rare species may be endangered by outbreaks of viral diseases, for example fibropapillomatosis of marine turtles, On the other hand, many viruses are isolated whose pathogenicity could not be evaluated so far, The most important infections from the point of view of a practitioner are the paramyxovirus infection in snakes, the inclusion body disease in boids and the herpesvirus infection in land tortoises, Ethiology, symptoms and diagnostic approaches of viral infections are described, Practitioners should be encouraged to take viral infections Into consideration especially if a whole collection of reptiles Is diseased, The possibility of transferring viruses of reptiles to humans is discussed.

AB  - As part of a planned introduction of captive Galapagos tortoises (Chelonoidis chathamensis) to the San Cristobal highland farms, our veterinary team performed thorough physical examinations and health assessments of 32 tortoises. Blood samples were collected for packed cell volume (PCV), total solids (TS), white blood cell count (WBC) differential, estimated WBC and a biochemistry panel including lactate. In some cases not all of the values were obtainable but most of the tortoises have full complements of results. Despite a small number of minor abnormalities this was a healthy group of mixed age and sex tortoises that had been maintained with appropriate husbandry. This work establishes part of a scientific and technical database to provide qualitative and quantitative information when establishing sustainable development strategies aimed at the conservation of Galapagos tortoises.

AB  - The sequence of differentiation of the epidermis of scutes during embryogenesis in the tortoise Testudo hermanni was studied using autoradiography, electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry. The study was mainly conducted on the epidermis of the carapace, plastron and nail. Epidermal differentiation resembles that described for other reptiles, and the embryonic epidermis is composed of numerous cell layers. In the early stages of differentiation of the carapacial ridge, cytoplasmic blebs of epidermal cells are in direct contact with the extracellular matrix and mesenchymal cells. The influence of the dermis on the formation of the beta-layer is discussed. The dermis becomes rich in collagen bundles at later stages of development. The embryonic epidermis is formed by a flat periderm and four to six layers of subperidermal cells, storing 40-70-nm-thick coarse filaments that may represent interkeratin or matrix material. Beta-keratin is associated with the coarse filaments, suggesting that the protein may be polymerized on their surface. The presence of beta-keratin in embryonic epidermis suggests that this keratin might have been produced at the beginning of chelonian evolution. The embryonic epidermis of the scutes is lost around hatching and leaves underneath the definitive corneous beta-layer. Beneath the embryonic epidermis, cells that accumulate typical large bundles of beta-keratin appear at stage 23 and at hatching a compact beta-layer is present. The differentiation of these cells shows the progressive replacement of alpha-keratin bundles with bundles immunolabelled for beta-keratin. The nucleus is degraded and electron-dense nuclear material mixes with beta-keratin. In general, changes in tortoise skin when approaching terrestrial life resemble those of other reptiles. Lepidosaurian reptiles form an embryonic shedding layer and crocodilians have a thin embryonic epidermis that is rapidly lost near hacthing. Chelonians have a thicker embryonic epidermis that accumulates beta-keratin, a protein later used to make a thick corneous layer.

AB  - The likeability of organisms is an effective tool for conservation education. However, stimulating the cute appeal of animals can also bolster the desire to possess them, and thus can encourage the trade in animals as pets. We assessed the perception of primary French schoolchildren (7-11 years old) for the Hermann tortoise (Testudo hermanni), a popular species endangered by illegal harvesting. Likeability for tortoises is associated with a strong willingness to protect them. Many children, however, expressed controversial attitudes toward them, such as the desire to possess a tortoise as a pet and to remove it from its natural habitat. Likeability was a significant determinant of these attitudes, and must thus be used with caution. Implementing these findings in conservation education programs should, therefore, be considered.

AB  - The global trade in tortoises of the genus Testudo was reviewed by using compiled import data from Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) for 1975-2005. A total of 58 importing and 112 exporting countries were recorded as being involved with the Testudo trade. Turkey, the former Soviet Union, the former Yugoslavia, Morocco, Uzbekistan, Russia, and Ukraine accounted for 81% of the recorded exports; whereas, the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States dominated the import market with 67% of the individuals. Testudo horfieldi accounted for 48% of the exports, followed by Testudo graeca (37%) and Testudo hermanni (13%). A total of 2,062,289 individuals were traded internationally, and of these, 99% were live animals. Of the animals from known sources, 67% were from the wild, and 16% were allegedly captive bred; the source of 70% of all declared trade animals was unknown.

AB  - EPH has been demonstrated to be a useful tool in companion animals while providing an opportunity to characterize globulinemias, including paraproteinemia. In EPH of non-traditional species, these same applications are important, but the primary use is to gauge the acute-phase and humoral immune responses. This includes the valid quantitation of albumin as well as the examination of fractions reflective of increases in acute-phase reactants and immunoglobulins. Agarose gel EPH and, more recently, capillary zone EPH have been applied to samples from these species. Performing these analyses provides special challenges in the placement of fraction delimits, generation of RIs, and interpretation of results. Recommended as part of routine bloodwork, EPH can also provide key results that are helpful in clinical and field-based health assessments as well as in prognostication.

AB  - The south-western part of Mehedinti County comprises many herpetofauna species, compared to most regions in Romania. This is how we managed to encounter 14 amphibian species (Salamandra salamandra, Lissotriton vulgaris, Triturus cristatus, Triturus dobrogicus, Bombina bombina, Bombina variegata, Pelobates fuscus, Bufo bufo, Bufo viridis, Hyla arborea, Pelophylax ridibundus, Pelophylax lessonae, Rana dalmatina, Rana temporaria) plus Pelophylax kl. esculentus and 15 reptile species (Emys orbicularis, Testudo hermanni, Ablepharus kitaibelii, Lacerta agilis, Lacerta viridis, Podarcis muralis, Podarcis taurica, Darevskia praticola, Anguis fragilis, Zamenis longissimus, Dolichophis caspius, Coronella austriaca, Natrix natrix, Natrix tessellata, Vipera ammodytes). Salamandra salamandra, Bombina variegata and Rana temporaria were identified at very low altitudes, lower than any other indication from Romania up to present. This is explained by the fact that mountain valleys, bearing here a typical aspect, reach all the way to the Danube, carrying with them the occurring species. In Blahnita Plain, Darevskia praticola appears in cleared areas, being present in the vegetation girdles bordering the canals found between agricultural fields.

AB  - Indirect (IIP) and direct (DIP) immunoperoxidase assays were developed for the serological and histological diagnoses of herpesvirus infection in tortoises, respectively. A, mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb HL1546), specific for the heavy chain of tortoise IgY, was used as the secondary antibody in the IIP assay. Rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against 2 sucrose gradient-purified tortoise herpesvirus isolates (HV4295/7R/95 and HV1976) were used as primary antibodies for the detection of herpesvirus antigen either in infected cell cultures or in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. The HP and DIP assays could detect either the presence of anti-herpesvirus antibody in the plasma of exposed tortoises or the presence of herpesvirus antigen in infected tissues, respectively. Although the UP test complements the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the serum neutralization test already available for measuring herpesvirus-specific antibody in tortoises, the DIP test is useful for the histological diagnosis of herpesvirus infection in tortoises.

AB  - Fires strongly influence the ecology of reptiles and have both direct and indirect effects on population dynamics as they affect life history traits. Here, we examine the effects of fire on individual growth patterns and on the survival rates of a tortoise Testudo graeca population in south-eastern Spain. We compare the biometric data from recaptures 4 years before and after a fire which burned 31 % of our study area. The von Bertalanffy and Gompertz growth models best describe the individual growth patterns for males and females. In males, but not females, fire significantly decreased the time required to reach their asymptotic size (k parameter). However, adult survival analyses reveal that the local survival rates lowered for both sexes after fire. Our work evidences that the effects of fire can be complex and maintained over time, affecting different life history traits.

AB  - The process of growth of horny scutes of the carapace and plastron in chelonians is poorly understood. In order to address this problem, the shell of the terrestrial tortoise Testudo hermanni, the freshwater turtle Chrysemys picta, and the soft shelled turtle Trionix spiniferus were studied. The study was carried out using immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy and autoradiography following injection of tritiated histidine. The species used in the present study illustrate three different types of shell growth that occur in chelonians. In scutes of Testudo and Chrysemys, growth mainly occurs in the hinge regions by the production of cells that accumulate beta-keratin and incorporate tritiated histidine. Newly produced bundles of alpha- and beta-keratin incorporate most of the histidine. No keratohyalin is observed in the epidermis of any of the species studied here. In Testudo, newly generated corneocytes containing beta-keratin form a corneous layer to form the growing rings of scutes. In Chrysemys, newly generated corneocytes containing beta-keratin form the new, expanded corneous layer. In the latter species, at the end of the growing season (autumn/fall), thin corneocytes containing little beta-keratin are produced underneath the corneous layer, and gradually form a scission layer. In the following growing season (spring-summer) the shedding layer matures and determines the loss of the outer corneous layer. In this way, scutes expand their surface at any new molt. In Trionix, no distinct scutes and hinge regions are present and during the growing season, new corneocytes are mainly produced along the perimeter of the shell. Corneocytes of Trionix contain little beta-keratin and form a thick corneous layer in which cells resemble the alpha-layer of the softer epidermis of the limbs, tail and neck. Neither keratohyalin nor specific histidine incorporation was observed in these cells. Corneocytes are gradually lost from the epidermal surface. Dermal scutes are absent in Trionix, but the dermis is organized in 6-10 layers of plywood-patterned collagen bundles. The stratified layers gradually disappear toward the growing border of the shell. The mode of growth of horny scutes in these different species of chelonians is discussed. (C) 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - In order to assess the efficacy of reinforcement as a conservation tool for rehabilitated elongated tortoises Indotestudo elongata (Blyth, 1854) we released 10 adults equipped with radio tracking transmitters to the Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary in northern Cambodia. Based on short-term success indicators for reintroduction studies on reptiles we studied the tortoises' adaptation to the new environment for five months. The tortoises successfully settled in the new environment without showing adverse effects regarding their behaviour, condition index (CI) and physical appearance. The annual survival rate was 76%. Based on individual locations collected, we analysed the tortoises' movement patterns including daily displacement, five-month and seasonal home range sizes using minimum convex polygons (MCPs) and fixed kernel density estimators (KDEs).

AB  - Plasma total calcium, ionised calcium and albumin levels in Hermann's tortoises (Testudo, hermanni), spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca), marginated tortoises (Testudo, marginata) and Horsfield's tortoises (Testudo horsfieldi) were investigated. The animals were captive adults maintained under natural unfiltered sunlight in the UK with no dietary sources of cholecalciferol. Analysis of total calcium data showed statistically significant seasonal elevations in females in August compared with March (P=0.003), and statistically significant elevations in females compared with males at all sampling points (March P=0.036, June P=0.003 and August P<0.0001). These differences in values became more prominent as the summer progressed. Albumin values did not appear significantly affected by season. However, males had significantly higher albumin levels than females in the August samples. A correlation between total calcium and ionised calcium was confirmed but there was no correlation between total calcium and albumin values. Total calcium levels were a poor indication of ionised calcium levels, which constituted between 18 and 57 per cent of the total calcium value.

AB  - Cryptosporidiosis is a disease caused by apicomplexan parasites of the genus Cryptosporidium, which affect the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals worldwide. In the present study, Cryptosporidium isolates from captive European tortoises (Testudo graeca, Testudo hermanni and Testudo marginata) in Italy were genetically characterised using gene/s encoding Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) and/or the hypervariable segment internal to the SSU rDNA. Six isolates from T. graeca, T. hermanni and T. marginata revealed 100% sequence identity with the zoonotic Cryptosporidium pestis (Cryptosporidium parvum 'bovine genotype'), while a sequence from one T. marginata was a unique uncharacterised genotype (Cryptosporidium sp. ex T. marginata). The new genotype is phylogenetically characterised as belonging to the intestinal cryptosporidial lineage. The present study indicates that tortoises may disseminate Cryptosporidium oocysts in the captive environment. The identification of the zoonotic genotype in the faeces of captive European tortoises indicates a potential risk for humans within the household. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the development and differentiation of chromaffin cells in the adrenal gland of the turtle Testudo hermanni during ontogenesis using histological, immunocytochernical and ultrastructural methods. The 26 developmental stages were divided into three periods: in the early period (stages 1-18, up to 20 days of incubation at 37 degrees C and 85% humidity), the chromaffin cells were observed from stage 12. They followed a ventro-lateral migration pathway with respect to the notochord and dorsal aorta, forming groups embedded in undifferentiated mesenchymal tissue. They reached the kidney surface only at the end of this period. Under the EM the chromaffin cells showed typical embryonic characters, such as rounded shape, high nucleus/plasmatic ratio, cell membrane with elongated processes; the cytoplasm contained a large number of free ribosomes, Golgi complexes, RER and a few chrornaffin granules distributed in small sets. The granules were small and displayed a high electrondensity. Numerous unmyelinated fibres ran close to the chromaffin cells. At the end of this period both nervous elements and chromaffin cells were positive to the antigen for Df3H. The intermediate period (stages 19-22, incubation days 21-35) was characterized by the first occurrence of steroidogenic cells on the ventromedial kidney surface. Some chromaffin cells were still found in the same position, whereas other cells were still migrating, maintaining their embryonic character. It was possible to divide the secretory granules into two types according to their shape and electrondensity: the more numerous N-type granules had a dark content, whereas the small number of A-type granules (consistent with the scarce PNMT reaction) displayed a light content. They occurred for the first time in this period. In the advanced period (stages 23-26, from incubation day 36 to hatching) the adrenal gland reached its definitive shape, although remaining immature; groups of variously sized chromalfin cells intermingled with steroldogenic cells, both lying on the kidney surface. Chromaffin granules were more numerous and larger than in the previous stages, frequently mingling in the same cell. A migration pathway of the chrornaffin cells along the nerve fibres can be hypothesized on the basis of their common origin and closeness. The polymorphic shape of chrontaffin cells with long cytoplasmic processes also accounts for their migrating fitness. We can assume that steroidogenic differentiation from the mesodermic blastema begins after the first chromaffin cells have completed their migration.

AB  - Background: Salmonella spp. and oxyurids are among the most prevalent bacterial and parasitic agents in reptiles. These organisms are routinely isolated in healthy tortoises, although heavy infections may cause significant pathology. Tortoises are considered a common source of reptile-associated salmonellosis, an important zoonosis reported worldwide. A survey of the prevalence of Salmonella spp. and oxyurids in 53 tortoises was conducted in southern Italy and a possible correlation between the two pathogens was therefore investigated.
   Results: Salmonella spp. and oxyurids were detected with a prevalence of 49.1 and 81.1%, respectively. A significant positive correlation between Salmonella spp. and oxyurids was demonstrated. However, confounding factors related to husbandry could have been involved in determining this correlation.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that caution should be exercised in translocation, husbandry, and human contact with tortoises and other exotic pets. Further studies on the epidemiology, molecular characterization and pathogenesis of Salmonella and oxyurids are needed to assess the actual impact of these organisms, as single or associated infections, on tortoises and on other exotic pets.

AB  - The ability to estimate quantity, which is crucially important in several aspects of animal behaviour (e.g. foraging), has been extensively investigated in most taxa, with the exception of reptiles. The few studies available, in lizards, report lack of spontaneous discrimination of quantity, whichmay suggest that reptiles could represent an exception in numerical abilities among vertebrates. We investigated the spontaneous ability of Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) to select the larger quantity of food items. Tortoises were able to choose the larger food item when exposed to two options differing in size, but equal in numerousness (0.25, 0.50, 0.67 and 0.75 ratio) and when presented with two groups differing in numerousness, but equal in size (1 versus 4, 2 versus 4, 2 versus 3 and 3 versus 4 items). The tortoises succeeded in both size and numerousness discrimination, and their performance appeared to depend on the ratio of items to be discriminated (thus following Weber's Law). These findings in chelonians provide evidence of an ancient system for the extrapolation of numerical magnitudes from given sets of elements, shared among vertebrates.

AB  - Although the pineal organ has been clearly implicated in the photoperiodic control of seasonal reproduction in several non-mammalians, the possible physiological role for melatonin, the major pineal hormone, is far from clear. In many studies on birds, reptiles, amphibians, fishes and even some invertebrates, it has been reported that melatonin administration can influence (usually suppress) reproductive parameters. However, in the vast majority of these studies, melatonin has been administered in an unphysiological manner, usually by injection, and/or dose. It is notable that in most studies where melatonin has been administered either using continuous-release implants or by treatments attempting to mimick the natural diurnal melatonin rhythm, no or limited effects on reproduction were observed. In conclusion, the data available to date do not support the concept that melatonin plays an important physiological role in the photoperiodic control of reproduction in non mammalians.

AB  - This study illustrates the potential of small-game data for identifying and dating Paleolithic demographic pulses such as those associated with modern human origins and the later evolution of food-producing economies. Archaeofaunal series from Israel and Italy serve as our examples. Three important implications of this study are that (I) early Middle Paleolithic populations were exceptionally small and highly dispersed, (2) the first major population growth pulse in the eastern Mediterranean probably occurred before the end of the Middle Paleolithic, and (3) subsequent demographic pulses in the Upper and Epi-Paleolithic greatly reshaped the conditions of selection that operated on human subsistence ecology, technology, and society. The findings of this study are consistent with the main premise of Flannery's broad-spectrum-revolution hypothesis. However, ranking small prey in terms of work of capture (in the absence of special harvesting tools) proved far more effective in this investigation of human diet breadth than have the taxonomic-diversity analyses published previously.

AB  - Testudo graeca, Testudo hermanni and Testudo marginata are endangered species listed in the IUCN Red List and Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Correct identification of species and distinct population units can support sound conservation projects and forensic applications. However, the collection of biological samples is not always easy or harmless. Blood sampling is usually invasive and risky. Salivary swab sampling is commonly used in other reptiles but can be unsafe for tortoises by the reason of their head retraction escape response. Cloacal swab sampling should be easier and less risky. In this study, we genotyped 37 tortoises at eight microsatellite loci and compared the reliability of individual genotypes obtained from blood, cloacal and buccal swabs. Results showed that performances of cloacal samples are comparable with those of buccal and blood samples, and proved that cloacal sampling is an alternative and reliable source of DNA for tortoise genotyping.

AB  - This study describes cases of introductions of exotic species and range expansion of native species in Serbia. The four most important introductions are the alien, invasive Trachenzys scripta elegans and native Testudo hermanni, Mediodactylus kotschyi and Podarcis muralis which expanded their ranges. Trachemys scripta elegans should be of special concern, since introductions of this species can have numerous negative effects on local ecosystems. Incidental introductions were documented for two alien (Pelodiscus sp. and Hemidactytlus turcicus) and two native species (Podarcis tauricus and Vipera ammodytes). The greatest number of introductions is concentrated around urban areas, especially around the cities of Belgrade and Novi Sad. Increased traffic, trading and cargo shipment, as well as a large number of people who keep exotic animals as pets, make large urban areas susceptible to accidental and deliberate introductions of amphibians and reptiles. On the other hand, anthropogenic alteration and degradation of habitats, along with increased urbanization, can provide corridors for the range expansion of native species.

AB  - Translocation of terrestrial turtles occurs to mitigate habitat loss, increase population size or genetic diversity, and to establish new populations. The success of many translocation efforts often depends on social and economic factors, but ecological factors may also affect translocation success. We used radiotelemetry to evaluate Three-Toed Box Turtle (Terrapene carolina triunguis) movements before and after translocation from a continuously forested site to a highly fragmented site and made comparisons to resident turtles. The average distance moved between consecutive 28-h relocations (dist_move) pretranslocation versus posttranslocation depended on turtle origin. Turtles translocated from the continuously forested site had greater mean dist_move following translocation, whereas resident turtles at the fragmented site had similar dist_move in both periods. Translocated turtles traveled greater total distances, had greater net displacement, and greater home-range size than resident turtles. Additionally, translocated turtles had directed movements, whereas resident turtles did not. Homing behavior or directed movement toward continuous forest adjacent to the release site may account for the movement patterns observed. Future translocations should consider the landscape context of the release sites as well as the landscape context of the original capture location.

AB  - Objective: The cardiac anatomy in tortoises depicted on B-mode and color-Doppler should be better differentiated by additional contrast-echocardiography. Material and methods: An intravenous contrast agent (INN-sulphur hexafluoride [SonoVue (R)]) was injected in four tortoises (three Testudo hermanni, one Agrionemys horsfieldii), via the coccygeal vein, with parallel B-mode echocardiographic examination. The results of the contrast-enhanced echocardiography were compared with the contrast-free B-mode recordings and color-Doppler ultrasound. Results: The use of SonoVue enabled clearer distinction of the cardiac structures, differentiation of the arising major arteries, identification of wash-out-shunts, and visualization of blood flow patterns throughout the tortoise heart. Conclusion and clinical relevance: This study enables the accurate depiction and differentiation of cardiac anatomy in tortoises through the use of a combination of B-mode, color-Doppler and contrast-echocardiography. Basic knowledge of blood flow in the reptile heart is essential to understand echocardiographic anatomy. Blood-flow-patterns and anatomy of the tortoise heart as found in this study will help to establish a basis for further echocardiographic examinations of these animals.

AB  - The present review of the herpetofauna of the small islands of the Cres-Losinj Archipelago (Croatia) is based on literature data and observations made by the authors in 2011 to 2014. The 16 islets and islands ranging in size between 0.05 km(2) (Zabodaski) and 16.92 km(2) (Unije) are all inhabited by at least one species of wall lizard of the genus Podarcis. The islands Koludarc, Unije and Veli Osir harbor Podarcis melisellensis fiumana (WERNER, 1891), while Kormat, Male Srakane, Mali Plavnik, Oruda, Palacol, Unije, Vele Srakane, Visoki and Zabodaski hold populations of Podarcis siculus campestris (RAFINESQUE-SCHMALTZ, 1810). Both taxa are present on Plavnik, Susak and Zeca. Caretta caretta (LINNAEus, 1758), is reported for the first time from the islands of Oruda and Unije, and Hierophis viridavus carbonarius (BONAPARTE, 1833) from Susak and Unije.

AB  - BackgroundDespite improvements in habitational conditions, kidney disease is relatively common in tortoises. ObjectivesPurpose of this study was the establishment of Symmetrical dimethylarginine (SDMA) reference values for clinically healthy Hermann's Tortoises. AnimalsClinically healthy Hermann's Tortoises (n = 131) were included in the period from October 2017 to September 2019. MethodsCreatinine and other biomarkers were tested at IDEXX Laboratories, Germany using residual blood samples from Hermann's tortoises. SDMA was measured with the IDEXX test and verified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry at IDEXX Laboratories, USA. ResultsSDMA values ranged from 1 to 21 mu g/dl (n = 131) for the IDEXX SDMA Test and SDMA values ranged from 1 to 17 mu g/dl (n = 82) for LC-MS. For the comparison of the two measuring systems, the following results were obtained R-2 = 0.75 (p < 0.001). Conclusion and Clinical ImportanceSDMA can be measured in Hermann's Tortoises and the reference values range in clinically healthy animals is comparable to that of dogs and cats.

AB  - Adenoviruses have been regularly detected in squamate reptiles; evidence of infection in chelonians is described much less frequently. The adenoviruses found in turtles and tortoises have been genetically diverse, and have included members of the genus Siadenovirus, a proposed testadenovirus genus, and, in a single case, an Atadenovirus. In this study, samples from 949 chelonians submitted to a diagnostic laboratory were screened for the presence of adenoviruses by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting a portion of the DNA polymerase gene. Adenoviruses were detected in 22 (2.3%) chelonians of different species. Adenovirus-positive species included Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni), spur-thighed tortoises (T. graeca), Horsfield's tortoises (T. horsfieldii), sliders (Trachemys spp.), box turtles (Terrapene spp.) and a black pond turtle (Geochlemys hamiltonii). Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of the obtained PCR products revealed that the majority of the detected adenoviruses (72.7%) cluster with members of the proposed testadenovirus genus, while the rest (27.3%) cluster with the atadenoviruses. This study significantly expands the known host range of both the proposed testadenoviruses and the atadenoviruses in different chelonian species and families.

AB  - Mediterranean and Russian tortoises (Testudo spp.) are popular companion animals (pets), despite ongoing controversy concerning privately keeping reptiles. The arguments used during these controversial discussions have often been based on outdated facts. Therefore, a survey was developed to evaluate the current population structure, husbandry conditions, diet regime, and health status of Testudo species in captivity. More than 75% of the 1075 respondents housed their tortoises in an outdoor enclosure containing a greenhouse or cold frame, which is considered the most species-appropriate way of husbandry. Of the respondents, 67.7% fed their tortoises with the optimum diet of more than 80% grasses and weeds during the summer vegetation period. Only 8.2% of respondents owned a tortoise with a diagnosed disease. According to the results, the likelihood of tortoises developing pyramidal growth syndrome, which can be used as an indicator of the quality of tortoise husbandry, was high in tortoises kept in a terrarium and/or fed a diet of less than 80% grasses and weeds in summer. This likelihood varied among species, with a higher incidence in Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni).

AB  - The present study is the first to monitor plasma chemistries of a group of 30 Hermann's tortoises (HTs) over two summer seasons to characterize and quantify seasonal and gender-related influences. The following analytes were analyzed: ALT, ALP, AST, BA, CA, CHO, CK, LDH, GLU, GLDH, P, TP, TRIG, urea and uric acid. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, mean values, confidence intervals were calculated. The overall results showed distinct patterns and somewhat unexpected results concerning the plasma chemistry changes induced by season and gender in a majority of routine biochemical analytes. TRIG, CHO, CA, and P were significantly higher in females. AST, ALT, BA, LDH and GLDH showed an increase in males in midsummer. ALP showed a significant and analogous seasonal variation for both sexes. GLU showed a moderate increase during midsummer. Uric acid and urea concentrations showed a distinct seasonal variation. For some analytes, fitted curves could be calculated describing the seasonal variation. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The herpetofauna from the Middle Pleistocene cave deposit of Valdemino (Borgio Verezzi, Liguria, north-western Italy) is represented by the following taxa: Triturus sp., Speleomantes sp., Pelodytes punctatus, Bufo bufo, Hyla gr. H. arborea, Rana dalmatina, Testudo hermanni, Tarentola cf. T mauritanica, Anguis fragilis, Lacerta gr. L. viridis, Lacertidae indet., Coronella cf C. austriaca, Elaphe sp., Hierophis viridiflavus, Malpolon monspessulanus, Colubrines indet., Natrix natrix and Vipera aspis. The most striking characteristic of the Valdemino assemblage is its modernity: all the identified taxa are members of the modern herpetofauna of western Liguria, including Pelodytes and Malpolon (identified for the first time in the Italian fossil record), that nowadays differentiate the western Ligurian herpetofauna from that of all the neighbouring Italian regions. The modernity of the herpetofauna sharply contrasts with the associated mammal fauna that still hosts, among others, Barbary ape, elephant, rhinoceros, leopard and sabre-toothed tiger. The assemblage testifies that the Ligurian herpetofauna was already established in the Middle Pleistocene and that it is not the result of post Wurmian dispersal, although cyclical immigrations (from Iberian or French refugia) during warm stages, followed by extinctions during the cold ones, cannot be ruled out.

AB  - The daily and annual cycle, the activity pattern, and the spatial behaviour of a population of Eurotestudo h. hermanni were investigated in a mesophilous wooded biotope of southern Italy. A total of eight animals', four males and four females, were fitted with transmitters and monitored for an entire season of activity. Daily activity patterns varied in relation to the season and the daily cycle. Basking activity was dominant in May-June and September, while feeding behaviour peaked in June and October, Mating behaviour was only observed in late summer, while evidence of egg laying was found from late spring, suggesting sperm storage by females. Size of home ranges varied between 1.0 and 3.3 ha for females and from 0.5 and 2.8 ha for males. A wider overlap was observed between home ranges of males and females, Suggesting a higher tolerance toward the other sex. Tortoises monitored for the entire activity period showed homing behaviour towards their hibernation sites, confirming the excellent orientation skills of the species.

AB  - This study developed a comprehensive framework to incorporate landscape ecological principles into the landscape planning and design process, with a focus on the design of new patches in the rural landscape. The framework includes two interrelated phases: patch analyst (PA) and patch designer (PD). The patch analyst augments the process of landscape inventory and analysis. It distinguishes nodes (associated with potential habitat patches) from links (associated with corridors and stepping stones between habitats). For natural vegetation patches, characteristics such as size, shape, and spatial arrangement have been used to develop analytical tools that distinguish between nodes and links. The patch designer uses quantitative information and analytical tools to recommend locations, shapes, sizes, and composition of introduced patches. The framework has been applied to the development of a new golf course in the rural Mediterranean landscape of Apulia, Southern Italy. Fifty new patches of Mediterranean maquis (24 patches) and garrigue (26 patches) have been designed and located in the golf course, raising the overall natural vegetation area to 70 ha (60% of total property). The framework has potential for use in a wide variety of landscape planning, design, and management projects.

AB  - The spider tortoise (Pyxis arachnoides) is endemic to the coastal, dry forests of southwest Madagascar, one of the country's most threatened habitats. Very little is known of the biology of this Critically Endangered species. We devised a three year capture-mark-recapture study to assess mean annual survival for the following cohorts; juvenile, adult male, adult female and adult of both sexes, for a population of spider tortoises using a Cormack-Jolly-Seber model. Low recapture probabilities prevented the modelling of all but the adult of both sexes cohort. Mean annual survival was 0.823 (SE +/- = 0.15; 95% CI = 0.565-1.0). We hypothesise that habitat loss could be impacting the survival of this cohort; however establishing control data to test for this is difficult because of the widespread habitat loss, even within protected areas. Therefore we suggest extending the study across a number of gradients of impacted habitat and increase the duration of the study to assess this risk to the population and improve model robustness.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine a wide range of selected hematologic, venous blood gases, and plasma biochemistry analytes in common chameleons (Chamaeleo chamaeleon). Blood samples were collected from the ventral tail vein of 41 common chameleons to determine reference intervals for 30 different blood analytes. The calcium-to-phosphorus ratio, packed cell volume (PCV), refractometric total solids (TS), blood cell counts, and differentials were also determined. The microscopic evaluation of blood smears revealed inclusion bodies in monocytes in 7 of the samples. Females showed significantly higher values of plasma proteins and calcium and cholesterol concentrations and males showed significantly higher values of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) plasma concentrations. Significant differences were found between similar analytes determined by different testing methodologies in the PCV/hematocrit, electrolytes (sodium, potassium), and plasma proteins [TS, total protein (TP) and albumin]. Blood analytes determined in this study can provide baseline data that may be useful when evaluating the health status of common chameleons, taking into consideration the potential effects of gender and the type of analyzer used.

AB  - Spotted turtles (Clemmys guttata) are an endangered species and are commonly encountered in the pet trade and in many zoological collections across the United States, yet peer-reviewed published reference intervals (RI) for common clinicopathologic tests are unavailable for this species. The objectives of this study were to calculate partial RI for routine hematology, biochemistry, and electrophoretic analyses, as well as to perform an initial comparison of capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) in this species. A single blood sample was obtained from a single collection of 32 apparently healthy captive spotted turtles weighing at least 100 g and was submitted for standard hematologic and biochemistry analyses, as well as electrophoresis via CZE and AGE methods. Partial RI were calculated for corresponding analytes for each type of testing. While CZE and AGE protein fractions were found to have good correlation, some significant differences were observed, reinforcing that RI should be reported with the specific method used for their determination. The spotted turtle electrophoretograms were distinctly different from those previously reported from turtles in the same taxonomic family, including differences in the number and relative prominence of protein fractions.

AB  - P>The prevalence of Salmonella infection was determined in a group of spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) seized during two smuggling attempts and in a population of captive Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) sheltered in a wildlife rescue centre. Salmonella spp. was isolated in 81 of 220 (36.8%) and in 17 of 67 (25.4%) cloacal swabs collected from the T. graeca and T. hermanni tortoises respectively. Overall, a total of 21 different Salmonella serotypes were found. Some of these serotypes are common to terrestrial chelonians while others have never been reported. All cultured serotypes were non-typhoidal but nonetheless many of these have been previously reported as source of human outbreaks of reptile-related salmonellosis. Eighty-two per cent and 5.3% of the isolates were resistant to two and three anti-microbial agents respectively. However, the isolates were highly susceptible to the anti-microbials of choice for the treatment of salmonellosis such as cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. Our findings confirm that tortoises can be considered a reservoir for Salmonella and that care should be employed when handling and breeding these animals. Tight surveillance should be enforced to avoid illegal importation and prevent the trading of live tortoises, carriers of zoonotic pathogens.

AB  - The Early Pleistocene fissure fillings of Cava Dell'Erba and Cava Pirro (Apricena, Apulia, Southern Italy) have yielded abundant fossil vertebrate remains. The study of more than 14 000 amphibian and reptile remains revealed the presence of the following 18 taxa (6 amphibians and 12 Reptiles): Triturus cf. T. alpestris, T. vulgaris group, Bufo bufo, Bufo viridis, Hyla arborea group, Rana cf. R. ridibunda vel Rana kl. R. esculenta, Testudo hermanni group, Emys orbicularis, Mauremys sp., Pseudopus sp., Podarcis sp., Lacerta sp., Blanus sp., Hierophis viridiflavus, Elaphe longissima, Coronella cf. C. austriaca, Natrix natrix, Vipera aspis group. Some of the materials referred to "Colubrines" indet. could represent taxa different from those listed above. The high taxonomic diversity, good preservation and abundance of the material place this herpetofauna amongst the most informative ever recovered in the European Quaternary. Some of the identified taxa are reported for the first time in Italy. Others are of particular interest as they help to fill present or past gaps in E-W disjunct ranges. The ecological requirements of the amphibians and reptiles suggest the presence of a typical Mediterranean landscape: a relatively dry environment with water bodies of temporary nature (at least those closer to the sites) surrounded by scattered trees or/and bushes.

AB  - Based on an integrative taxonomic approach, we examine the differentiation of Southeast Asian snail-eating turtles using information from 1863 bp of mitochondrial DNA, 12 microsatellite loci, morphology and a correlative species distribution model. Our analyses reveal three genetically distinct groups with limited mitochondrial introgression in one group. All three groups exhibit distinct nuclear gene pools and distinct morphology. Two of these groups correspond to the previously recognized species Malayemys macrocephala (Chao Phraya Basin) and M. subtrijuga (Lower Mekong Basin). The third and genetically most divergent group from the Khorat Basin represents a previously unrecognized species, which is described herein. Although Malayemys are extensively traded and used for religious release, only few studied turtles appear to be translocated by humans. Historic fluctuations in potential distributions were assessed using species distribution models (SDMs). The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) projection of the predictive SDMs suggests two distinct glacial distribution ranges, implying that the divergence of M. macrocephala and M. subtrijuga occurred in allopatry and was triggered by Pleistocene climate fluctuations. Only the projection derived from the global circulation model MIROC reveals a distinct third glacial distribution range for the newly discovered Malayemys species.

AB  - Using mtDNA sequences and 12 microsatellite loci, we compare populations of Testudo graeca from Sardinia and North Africa. The observed pattern of almost no differentiation combined with reduced variation in the Sardinian population is consistent with introduction in prehistoric or historic times from what is now Tunisia and neighbouring Algeria. Furthermore, in the light of the recently published recommendation to eradicate the non-native T. graeca from Italy, we review recent studies on the archaeological and fossil record, on the phylogeography and population genetics of the three other chelonian species occurring in Sardinia (Emys orbicularis, T. hermanni, T. marginata). We conclude that the extant Sardinian populations of all four species are not native. However, they are and should be safeguarded under EC law (Council Regulation No 338/97 on the Protection of Species of Wild Fauna and Flora; Flora Fauna Habitat Directive: Appendix IV, Art. 12) because they serve as a back-up for the declining mainland populations. Moreover, these populations constitute an important part of the human-shaped natural heritage of the Mediterranean.

AB  - Archaeological investigations carried out in the cave Zubbio di Cozzo San Pietro, Bagheria, Sicily, revealed the presence of a few skeletal elements of a large-sized tortoise in a funerary area dating to the Copper/Bronze Age. The tortoise has been AMS-dated revealing an age of 12.5 +/- 0.5 kyr BP and therefore it pre-dates the funerary activities. The morphology of the retrieved skeletal elements differs from that of the only native tortoise currently living in Sicily, Testudo hermanni. The tortoise's size significantly exceeds the size range of extant Te. hermanni and all Testudo spp., as well as that of their known fossils, and suggests a shell length of 50-60 cm. Repeated efforts to obtain DNA sequences from the tortoise of Zubbio di Cozzo San Pietro failed, but the morphology of the femur is distinct enough to allow us to erect a new taxon, Solitudo sicula gen. et sp. nov., based on a parsimony analysis. It belongs to a hitherto unrecognized clade that includes other large-sized tortoises from Mediterranean islands, like Malta and Menorca. A review of the pertinent taxa indicates that the remains here described represent the geologically youngest large-sized tortoise of the Mediterranean area.

AB  - The standard of today's reptile practice calls on clinicians to use an ever-increasing array of diagnostic tools to gather information and obtain a definitive diagnosis. Few, if any, pathognomonic signs exist for reptile diseases, and for most clinical syndromes there is a lack of information regarding pathophysiology for one to define standard therapeutic protocols based solely on dinical signs without objective diagnostic information. For example, in the relatively distant past, clinicians treating reptile patients would routinely administer parenteral calcium to green iguanas (Iguana iguana) with the primary presenting clinical sign of muscle tremors. Today, veterinarians who treat reptiles recognize that the risk of soft tissue mineralization and permanent damage to arteries, renal tubules, and other tissues ugually outweighs the potential short-term benefit of calcium therapy. Before calcium therapy is initiated, it is best to know the patient's ionized calcium concentration to reduce the risk of potential adverse therapeutic side effects. A problem-oriented diagnostic approach directed toward minimizing risk and maximizing therapeutic benefit is now the standard of reptile practice. Copyright 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tortoises perceive different colours and rely on the visual system to find food. However, few studies have considered colour preference in tortoises, especially in land species. The aim of this study is to investigate whether Aldabra giant tortoises (Geochelone gigantea) housed in Parco Natura Viva (VR), an Italian zoological garden, show a specific colour preference in their social context. The study was divided into two different periods in which red and yellow balls of the same size were scattered around in the outdoor enclosure. In the first period, pieces of carrots were placed behind each ball whereas in the second period, carrots were replaced with apples. Data on the frequencies of interaction with red and yellow balls were collected. First, tortoises interacted more with the balls when pieces of apples rather than carrots were hidden behind them. No significant group level colour preference was found; however, individual-level variation in colour preference was reported. In addition, tortoises interacted significantly more with the yellow balls in the second than in the first period. Food typology seems therefore to play an important role in determining colour preference in chelonians. Research aimed at identifying individual differences in animal preferences might be valuable to improve captive animal husbandry (e.g.: development of enrichment programmes, diets and rewards).

AB  - A phylogenetic meta-analysis of patterns and drivers of body size evolution across a global sample of paired island-mainland populations of terrestrial vertebrates shows that 'island rule' effects are widespread in mammals, birds and reptiles, but less evident in amphibians, which mostly tend towards gigantism.
   Island faunas can be characterized by gigantism in small animals and dwarfism in large animals, but the extent to which this so-called 'island rule' provides a general explanation for evolutionary trajectories on islands remains contentious. Here we use a phylogenetic meta-analysis to assess patterns and drivers of body size evolution across a global sample of paired island-mainland populations of terrestrial vertebrates. We show that 'island rule' effects are widespread in mammals, birds and reptiles, but less evident in amphibians, which mostly tend towards gigantism. We also found that the magnitude of insular dwarfism and gigantism is mediated by climate as well as island size and isolation, with more pronounced effects in smaller, more remote islands for mammals and reptiles. We conclude that the island rule is pervasive across vertebrates, but that the implications for body size evolution are nuanced and depend on an array of context-dependent ecological pressures and environmental conditions.

AB  - The interpretation of plasma biochemical profiles can be confounded by the methodologies by which samples are analyzed. The goal of this study was to compare agreement between two biochemical analyzers for plasma samples from alligator snapping turtles (Macrochelys temminckii). Blood was obtained from the dorsal coccygeal vein of captive-reared, juvenile turtles (n = 34), stored in lithium heparin tubes, and centrifuged to separate plasma from whole blood. Plasma samples were stored at 5 degrees C prior to and in between analyses on VetScan (VetScan2, Abaxis, Union City, CA 94587, USA) and Olympus (Olympus AU640, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA 92821, USA) analyzers within 2 hr of each other. Agreement between the VetScan and Olympus analyzers was investigated using Passing-Bablok regression analysis for aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, potassium, and sodium. Agreement between the two analyzers was outside of acceptance limits and outside of clinical allowable error limits for all analytes as established by the American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology. The results of biochemical analyses of alligator snapping turtle plasma cannot be compared between VetScan and Olympus analyzers in a clinical setting. Comparison of biochemical analyses within analyzer units, however, may still be clinically useful. Future studies are warranted to investigate the precision of each analyzer for alligator snapping turtle plasma.

AB  - The processes underlying macroecological gradients in body size are widely debated, in part because their intraspecific variability remains poorly described even in well-studied taxa such as vertebrates. In this study, we investigated how climate, habitat, genetic lineage and sex explain body size variations in French populations of the European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis). We measured 7016 adult individuals captured in 41 populations, covering most of the species' distribution in metropolitan France, including Corsica. Body size variation in our sample was wide and comparable to that found across the species' worldwide range. Variation was similar in magnitude at regional and local levels, suggesting that body size is influenced by local factors as much as by regional factors such as climate or genetic lineage. Smaller sizes were associated with Mediterranean or altered oceanic climates, and with two lineages (E. o. galloitalica and E. o. galloitalica/E. o. orbicularis), while larger sizes were associated with northern environments and the orbicularis lineage. Body size variations recorded at local level reflect an adaptive response to environmental constraints, suggesting that habitat is also an important factor in understanding size variation.

AB  - The status of amphibians (5 species) and reptiles (16 species) from the Iblean area (south eastern Sicily) was been analysed taking into account the data from literature and, above all, those obtained during a research-period of more than 10 years (19882001). All the 54 UTM squares (10x10 km) included in the Iblean area were investigated. The status of each species was defined following the criteria suggested by the IUCN on the basis of the diffusion in Sicily and in the Iblean area, the autoecology, and the risk factors deriving from human activities. The results confirmed a general sensitivity of amphibians, especially of Discoglossus pictus and Hyla intermedia, the former widely distributed but endangered due to its insular distribution and to human impact, the latter very localised in the studied area and at the southernmost limit of its distribution. The reptiles were less sensitive, although some species need special protection due to the destruction of their habitats or commercial use (e. g., Emys orbicularis, Testudo hermanni and Zamenis situlus). Some general considerations on the main problems related to the conservation of the Iblean herpetofauna are provided: it is clear that the only way to guarantee an effective safeguarding of the biological communities is to create a 'Regional Iblean Park'.

AB  - The fossiliferous deposit (karst cavity) in La Grave, a locality near the small town of Avetrana (Taranto, southern Italy), has yielded numerous fossils of vertebrates. The remains of large mammals have been the subject of several studies. This paper examines the remains of small vertebrates and identifies four taxa of amphibians (Bufo bufo, Bufotes gr. B. viridis, Hyla gr. H. arborea and Rana (s.l.) sp.), four taxa of reptiles (Testudo hermanni, Podarcis sp., Zamenis gr. Z. longissimus, Natrix natrix), and nine taxa of small mammals (Erinaceus europaeus, Crocidura suaveolens, Arvicola italicus, Microtus (Terricola) savii, Microtus (Microtus) arvalis, Apodemus gr. A. sylvaticus - A. flavicollis, Hystrix (Acanthion) vinogradovi, Oryctolagus cuniculus and Lepus corsicanus). From a biochronological point of view, the data on small and large vertebrates indicate an age between the beginning of the Late Pleistocene (MIS 5e) and the central part of MIS 3. The most recent fossiliferous layer (bed 8) is likely to have been deposited during a cooler period when compared to the previous layers.The data from small fossil vertebrates combined with those emerging from the large mammals and birds evidence the presence, near the karstic cavity, of open spaces (prairies) with pools of water, bordered by wooded areas and, not far, the presence of a rocky coastline.

AB  - The high frequency of same-sex sexual behaviors (SSB) in free-ranging animals is an evolutionary puzzle because fitness benefits are often unclear in an evolutionary context. Moreover, the physiological and genetic underpinnings of SSB remain unclear. We exploited an extraordinary natural experiment to examine the impact of environmental factors (local sex ratio [SR]) and testosterone (T) levels on SSB in a dense population of Hermann's tortoises monitored for 7 years. Under the combination of high density and extremely skewed SR (similar to 50 females, > 1000 males), males courted and mounted other males more frequently than females. They even exhibited extravagant sexual behaviors, attempting to copulate with dead conspecifics, empty shells, and stones. T levels remained within the species' normal range of variation. SSB was not observed in other populations where SR is not, or less skewed, and where density is lower. This study reports the first natural example of a "prison effect," whereby a high population density combined with female deprivation triggered SSB as a mere outlet of sexual stimulation. More generally, it supports the hypothesis that SSB can be a nonadaptive consequence of unusual proximate factors rather than reflecting physiological disorders.

AB  - Multiple dosing pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole were determined after oral administration of the drug at two dosage levels (15 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg) to captive gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyhemus).  Using a crossover experimental design, eight tortoises were dosed at each level every 24 hr for 72 hr.  Prior to drug dosage, the health status of each tortoise was assessed by physical examination and measurements of body weight to carapace length ratio, serum chemistries, hematocrit, and total plasma protein concentration.  Overt toxic effects of ketoconazole were evaluated by repetition of these measurements during sample collection and 72 hr after initial drug administration.  Plasma concentrations of ketoconazole were measured using high performance liquid chromatography on blood samples collected via venous catheterization before and > 78 hr after drug administration.  At the 15 mg/kg dosage level, the rising plasma concentration phase (RPCP) half-life was 1.5 +/- 1.4 hr and the falling plasma concentration phase (FPCP) half-life was 13.2 +/- 1.7 hr.  At the 30 mg/kg dosage level, the RPCP half-life was 0.3 +/- 0.1 hr and the FPCP half-life was 14.4 +/- 2.5 hr.  Both doses resulted in therapeutic concentrations of drug in plasma at steady state.  No hematologic or serum chemistry alterations attributable to drug toxicity were detected.

AB  - Homopus signatus signatus inhabits an and region with unpredictable winter rainfall. To help understand the species' response to variation in rainfall, we measured spring body condition (BC) over 5 years and seasonal BC over 15 months. Total rainfall influenced BC but the timing and frequency of rain were important. In 2 successive years with low rainfall, BC was significantly lower in the year when most rain fell in late winter, than in the year with more frequent showers. Females tended to have a higher spring BC than males, perhaps because females nest in spring, The low spring BC of juveniles, relative to adults, may be ascribed to the juvenile shell that is less ossified than that of adults, giving juveniles a lower body mass to shell volume ratio. Seasonal fluctuations in BC were substantial; female body mass declined by 18% from summer to mid-winter but increased after the first rains to high values in spring. We compared two BC indices, the ratio of body mass to (1) carapace length and (2) shell volume. The latter index varied more among years and provides a ratio that closely approximates the body density of tortoises. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Morphological characteristics of peripheral blood cells, micronucleated erythrocyte counts and plasma biochemistry profile were examined in fourteen healthy captive Mauremys caspica and in twenty-three Mauremys rivulata. The size of erythrocyte cells were 19.07 x 11.68 mu m and 19.76 x 11.44 mu m for M. caspica and M. rivulata, respectively. Nucleus sizes were 6.50 x 5.30 mu m for M. caspica and 6.79 x 5.45 mu m for M. rivulata. The micronucleated erythrocyte (MNE) values were 0.0008 and 0.0037 for the males and females of M. caspica, respectively. The MNE values were 0.0002 for male and female M. rivulata.
   We found sex-dependent differences only in the Ca value in the blood biochemistry profile for healthy M. caspica. Sex-dependent differences were found only in albumin and P values in the blood biochemistry profile for healthy M. rivulata. No significant differences were found between males of both species in question with respect to plasma biochemistry values. However, only plasma total protein and Ca content levels differed significantly between the females of the two species.

AB  - A major difference between reptile and mammalian herbivores is that the former do not masticate their food. Actually, food particle size reduction by chewing is usually considered one of the adaptations facilitating the higher metabolic rates of mammals. However, quantitative comparisons of ingesta particle size between the clades have, to our knowledge, not been performed so far. We measured mean fecal particle size (MPS) in 79 captive individuals of 14 reptile herbivore species (tortoises, lizards, and Corucia zebrata) by wet sieving and compared the results with a mammalian dataset. MPS increased with body mass in both clades, but at a significantly higher level in reptiles. Limited evidence in free-ranging and captive individuals of Testudo hermanni indicates that in reptiles, the ability to crop food and food particle size significantly influence fecal particle size. The opportunistic observation of a drastic particle size difference between stomach and intestinal contents corroborates findings that in reptiles, in contrast to terrestrial mammals, significant ingesta particle size reduction does occur in the gastrointestinal tract, most likely owing to microbial action during very long ingesta retention. Whether behavioral adaptations to controlling ingesta particle size, such as deliberate small bite sizes, are adaptive strategies in reptiles remains to be investigated. J. Exp.

AB  - Complex and ritualized displays require an assemblage of structural, neuronal, and muscular adaptations, and habitat structure may affect the effectiveness of signals to convey information. Therefore, ornament exaggeration through sexual selection may be severely constrained by the costs imposed by natural selection. We investigated this compromise in the courtship behavior of Mediterranean Tortoises by assessing the variability of the acoustic and behavioral signals used among species, and the relationship between courtship and species body size. Marginated, Greek, and Hermann's Tortoises base their courtship on the same kinds of displays, and differences among species rely mainly on the relative importance of aggressive displays with respect to acoustic signals. We found that the divergence of courtship patterns among species was also related to body size. Greek Tortoises, intermediate in size between the other two species, showed an intermediate courtship aggression. Body size in Mediterranean Tortoises relates to different vegetation structure of their preferred habitat, smaller species being advantaged in denser vegetation. Therefore, the divergence of courtship patterns in the three species of European tortoises might have been promoted by the progressive adaptation of incipient species to habitats with different vegetation structures. Because courtship signals play a central role in species isolation, a link between morphology and courtship is of particular interest and might be one of the central mechanisms of tortoise diversification.

AB  - The courtship behavior of male Greek tortoises (Testudo graeca) is based on a multiple signaling system that involves tactile, visual, olfactory, and acoustic signals. In some recent studies on marginated (Testudo marginata) and Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) we showed that male mounting success was significantly and positively correlated to the intensity of courtship displays. This was due to the number of rams and bites and the number of calls emitted during mounting, which are considered to be condition-dependent signals that reliably convey information on male quality. In this correlative study, we analyzed relationships between male morphology, hematological profile, courtship intensity, vocalizations, and mounting success in a group of 104 Greek tortoises breeding in seminatural enclosures. As expected, our study showed that mounting success of males was positively correlated to the number of rams and the frequency of interactions during courtship and negatively correlated to the call duration. Moreover the hematocrit was positively correlated with the call rate and the number of rams. Therefore, courtship signals exhibited by male Greek tortoises, including vocalizations, reliably reveal different components of male condition, and females may use these signals to choose high-quality partners, as previously observed in marginated and Hermann's tortoises.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of whole-body plethysmography as a non-invasive method to determine the respiratory parameters and profiles in two tortoise species belonging to the genus Testudo. Pulmonary functions and volumetric parameters were determined in 10 adults of Testudo hermanni and in seven Testudo marginata animals, using whole-body plethysmography. A profile pattern was regularly observed: an inspiratory flow peak, an expiratory peak, an apnoea phase and a second expiratory peak, previous to the beginning of the next respiratory cycle. Positive and significant correlation was observed between the inspiratory time, weight and length of the tortoises. Larger tortoises showed a higher time of inhalation. The peak of inspiratory flow was correlated with the sex, being longer in the females. T. marginata had an inspiratory time longer than that of T. hermanii. In T. hermanii, differences related to the sex were observed in the tidal volume, peak inspiratory flow, peak expiratory flow, expiratory flow of 50 per cent and enhanced pause, which could be related to the smaller size of males. The results suggest that additional information on new technologies currently used in pet medicine or even in human medicine should be developed and adjusted as alternative ways to support the rehabilitation of turtles and tortoises.

AB  - Upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) has been implicated as a cause of decline of wild populations of desert tortoises, Gopherus agassizii, in the western Mojave Desert. One explanation for outbreaks of disease may be the release or escape of diseased captive tortoises into naive wild populations. Because Mycoplasma agassizii and tortoise herpesvirus have surfaced as important pathogens, 179 captive tortoises were evaluated in the greater community of Barstow, San Bernardino County, California during 2000 and 2001 to determine pathogen exposure. An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to detect antibodies against Mycoplasma agassizii (n = 179) and tortoise herpesvirus (n = 109). Anti-mycoplasma antibodies were present in 82.7% of the tortoises while anti-herpesvirus antibodies were detected in 26.6%. A positive association was found between tortoises with anti-mycoplasma antibodies and severity of clinical signs of URTD (p = 0.001) and with age categories, with adults being more likely to be positive (p < 0.001). Neither association was found with herpesvirus exposure. No association was found between gender and pathogen exposure or between being positive for exposure to both pathogens. Findings Suggest that captive tortoises can be a source of infection for free ranging desert tortoises. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Studies on the basic aspects of population biology, including, e.g., sex ratio and size or age structure, are important for designating management programs for threatened species. Nonetheless, very few studies of this type are available as for the African tortoises and turtles. The authors studied sex ratio and size structure of Togolese populations of Kinixys homeana BELL, 1827, Pelomedusa cf. subrufa (BONNATERRE, 1789) [probably P. variabilis PETZOLD et al., 2014, or P. olivacea (SCHWEIGGER, 1812)], and Pelusios castaneus (SCHWEIGGER, 1812), and report corresponding morphometric data (shell measurements, body mass). All the studied populations were similar in terms of both sex ratio (close to 1:1) and sexual size dimorphism (not significant), but differed remarkably as for their overall size structure. Kinixys homeana showed a population profile in which neither juveniles nor full-grown adults were observed. In contrast, the population profiles of the two aquatic species revealed a considerable proportion of juveniles and subadults. These patterns are interpreted as a signal of decline for the population of K. homeana and sustaining populations as for the two aquatic Pelomedusidae.

AB  - To test phylogenetic relationships within the genus Testudo (Testudines: Testudinidae), we have sequenced a fragment of the mitochondrial (mt) 12S rRNA gene of 98 tortoise specimens belonging to the genera Testudo, Indotestudo, and Geochelone. Maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining methods identify two main clades of Mediterranean tortoises, one composed of the species Testudo graeca, Testudo marginata, and Testudo kleinmanni and a second of Testudo hermanni, Testudo horsfieldii, and Indotestudo elongata. The first clade, but not the second, was also supported by maximum parsimony analysis. Together with the genus Geochelone, a star-like radiation of these clades was suggested, as a sister-group relationship between the two Testudo clades could not be confirmed. The intraspecies genetic variation was examined by sequencing the mt 12S rRNA fragment from 28 specimens of T. graeca and 49 specimens of T. hermanni from various geographic locations. Haplotype diversity was found to be significantly larger in T. graeca compared with T. hermanni, suggestive of reduced genetic diversity in the latter species, perhaps due to Pleistocene glaciations affecting northern and middle Europe or other sources of lineage reduction. No ancient mt 12S rRNA gene haplotypes were identified in T. graeca and/or T. hermanni originating from islands in the Mediterranean Sea, suggesting that these islands harbor tortoise populations introduced from the European and African mainland.

AB  - Pastrina Protected Area, a medium-sized Natura 2000 protected area in NW Bulgaria, was chosen as a model site for studying the species diversity of amphibians and reptiles in relation to habitat diversity. The analyses encompass field data for a five-year period. The territory of the survey was divided into a 1 x 1 km grid. The number of species and the number of habitats were recorded for each grid cell. For open and agricultural habitats data were taken from a map with physical blocks. For forested territories, the national forest database was used. The grid cells with missing data were filled in using CORINE Land Cover. A list of threats was prepared in order to estimate their impact. A strong correlation between habitat and species diversity was found: the latter was clearly determined by the presence of certain habitats known to maintain high species diversity. Habitats such as the thermophilous deciduous forests and their surrounding territories were the most important habitats, with higher species diversity and a higher percentage of species of conservation priority, e.g. Triturus cristatus, Bombina bombina, B. variegata and Testudo hermanni. These species were found from only 11.7% of the territory of the protected area, that makes those species vulnerable, with an uncertain future status.

AB  - We present the first comprehensive review of the diversity of the herpetofauna of the Natura 2000 site Ponor Special Protection Area. We compiled data from 22 publications covering 20 species and carried out multiple field visits between 1998-2012, recording 375 locations confirming all previously reported species and reporting four new species. These are Hyla arborea complex, Bufotes viridis complex, Coronella austriaca and Zamenis longissimus; we exclude Anguis fragilis complex due to recent taxonomic changes in this group. The presence of three additional potential species (Emys orbicularis, Testudo hermanni and Darevskia praticola) remains to be confirmed. All collected localities fall within 60 of 113 2x2 UTM squares, providing > 53% coverage. The elevation ranges for the species generally conform with their expected distributions in Bulgaria. Nine habitat types are of particular importance for the herpetofauna in Ponor Special Protection Area (Shannon diversity index H' >= 2.00), containing 77% of the locations for the observed species and 100% of the species. Four are either open habitats with high level of naturalness or small-scale extensive agricultural lands and four are natural broad-leaf forests. The currently obtained herpetological data can be used in the development of future management plans for this protection area and should be included in the update of the Natura 2000 Standard Data Form. Ponor Special Protection Area is demonstrated as a site of substantial local importance for the conservation of amphibian and reptile communities.

AB  - Despite gastrointestinal parasites being commonly diagnosed in captive tortoises throughout the UK, there is a lack of data regarding the prevalence. The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in tortoises in the UK, and to investigate the factors affecting the prevalence of these parasites. Owners were invited to submit a faecal sample from their tortoise in conjunction with a completed questionnaire covering details of signalment and husbandry. Data from the questionnaires were analysed at the end of the study. Faecal analysis was performed on samples from Testudo hermanni, Testudo graeca and Testudo horsfieldii. This involved examination of direct wet preparations, a modified McMaster technique, passive NaCl flotation and Cryptosporidium staining. Of the 142 samples used, 130 were examined by the first three methods. 49 per cent were positive for one or more parasites. Of the positive samples, 67 per cent were positive for oxyurids, 28 per cent were positive for ascarids and 28 per cent were positive for protozoa (Balantidium, Nyctotherus or flagellates). Only 1/113 (0.8 per cent) samples was positive for Cryptosporidium. The most important risk factors for parasites were sex (F) and length of time (<5 years) in owner's possession. This survey showed that gastrointestinal parasites are frequently detected in the faecal samples of captive tortoises in the UK, but their prevalence may be influenced by various factors including sex, length of time owned, age and species.

AB  - The responses of animal communities to fire are not well understood. We used modelling techniques to analyse how fire altered the habitat suitability of amphibian and reptile species across a 37-year chronosequence (1975-2011). The study was conducted at a biogeographical crossroads between the Mediterranean and medio-European bioregions. Using 9449 georeferenced locations, we examined the temporal variation in species-specific relative abundance, and built realized niche models with Maxent. We compared the habitat suitability index of Maxent models between two distant periods with a large number of records (1987-1989 and 2009-2011), and separated by two years with high fire activity, 1990 and 2003. Generalized linear models were applied to check temporal variation in habitat suitability indexes between the two periods as well as biogeographical affinity. Fire-history variables contributed strongly to the realized niche models. Due to high fire activity in the study area, habitat suitability decreased between the 1987-1989 and 2009-2011 periods for non-Mediterranean species. In contrast, most Mediterranean species benefited as a result of the land-cover openness created by fire. Modelling techniques are a useful complement to fieldwork for examining patterns in species responses to fire at biogeographical crossroads. The biogeographical affinity of species predicts their responses to fire.

AB  - The size-and-age composition of T. hermanni population in the Eminska Mountain - the easternmost part of the Balkan Range (Stara Planina), strongly suggests that this population is slowly declining: only 18.6% of the population are animals under 10 years; the size class 161-180 (32.4%) mm and the age class of 16 - 20 years (28.4%) dominate in the population. The sex ratio is approximately in parity (57.6% males: 42.4% females). Males dominate in the smaller size classes, and there are only females in the largest size classes. The carapace length of the hatchlings varies from 32.5 to 40 mm, the body weight - from 10 to 17 g. The linear growth is described by the equation of von Bertalanffy L = 287(1-e(-0.0436(t+3.26))). Similar growth parameters are determined in some populations of Greece and France. Regressions of the tortoise body weight (W, g), carapace width (Wd, mm), and carapace height (11, mm) on the carapace length (L, mm) are described by the equations: In W = -3.7452+2.0939 In L; In Wd = 0.3635 + 0.8792 ln L, and In H = -0.2151 + 0.9088 ln L, respectively. At the same carapace length, the females have greater average weights and average heights, and smaller average widths than the males.

AB  - We provide a taxonomic review of the extinct testudinid Testudo catalaunica, based on published and unpublished material from several Miocene (late Aragonian and early Vallesian) sites of the Valles-Penedes Basin (north-east Iberian Peninsula). We show that Testudo catalaunica irregularis is a junior subjective synonym of T.catalaunica, and further provide an emended diagnosis of the latter based on newly reported material. Contrary to some recent suggestions, this emended diagnosis discounts an alternative attribution of T.catalaunica to Paleotestudo. The latter is merely recognized as a subgenus of Testudo, based on a cladistic analysis that assessed the phylogenetic position of all extant and most extinct species of Testudo currently recognized as valid (including T.catalaunica). Our phylogenetic analysis (which recovers the molecular phylogeny of extant Testudo s.l.) supports a taxonomic scheme in which the three extant subgenera of Testudo are represented in the fossil record. Testudo s.s. is retrieved as the sister taxon of Testudo (Agrionemys)+[Testudo (Paleotestudo)+Testudo (Chersine)]. The extinct Testudo (Paleotestudo) is therefore the sister taxon of the Testudo (Chersine) clade. The latter subgenus reveals as the most diverse clade of Testudo s.l. in the fossil record, with T.catalaunica+Testudo steinheimensis constituting a subclade distinct from that including Testudo hermanni.

AB  - Freshwater turtles are sensitive to environmental changes and can serve as sentinel species for ecosystem health assessments. The Efroymson Restoration at Kankakee Sands in northwestern Indiana, USA has been restored in the past 25 yr from primarily agricultural land to a mosaic of prairie and wetland habitats. Health assessments of 40 free-ranging painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) at Kankakee Sands were performed in May 2021 to evaluate overall health status, screen for infectious diseases, and obtain baseline clinical pathology values in this population. Assessment of each turtle included a physical examination, complete blood count, plasma biochemistry panel, blood lactate level, venous blood gas analysis, serum trace mineral panel, serum vitamin D3 level, and plasma protein electrophoresis. Oral and cloacal swabs were tested for adenoviruses, herpesviruses, frog virus 3, and Mycoplasmopsis species by PCR in 39 painted turtles. Four turtles were positive for adenovirus, which shared 100% homology to Sulawesi tortoise adenovirus. Two turtles were herpesvirus-positive with 100% homology to emydid herpesvirus 1. No Mycoplasmopsis spp. or frog virus 3 was detected. Female turtles had significantly higher manganese, prealbumin, uric acid, triglycerides, and ionized calcium levels, while male turtles had significantly higher cholesterol, glutamate dehydrogenase, and CO2 levels. These baseline data can be used for future research into freshwater turtle health in restored wetland habitats.

AB  - The Alligator Snapping Turtle (Macrochelys temminckii) is a large freshwater turtle endemic to river systems that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. Turtle populations were sharply reduced by commercial harvest in the 1970s and 1980s; however, the species has yet to be protected under the Endangered Species Act. While anthropogenic stressors such as habitat fragmentation and degradation and illegal caputre continue to threaten populations, the defree to which disease may be contributing to any decline of the Alligator Snapping Turtle is unknown. Data were collected from 97 free-ranging Alligator Snapping Turtles in nine waterways in Florida and Georgia from 2001 to 2006. Eleven turtles were caputred more tha once, resulting in a total sample pool of 123. Reference ranges were established for complete blood count, plasma biochemistry values, trace metals (mercury, zinc, copper, lead, and arsenic), and nutrient parameters (vitamins A, E, D, and selenium), Variations by capture location, sex, and season were detected and likely resulted from external factors such as habitat and diet. Turtles sampled in one location were positive for tortoise herpesviral antibodies. Blood mercuru values also differed among populations. This study provides justification for the use of these long-lived aquatic turtles as biologic monitors of the health of local freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - The condition index (CI) of the tortoises Testudo graeca, T. hermanni hermanni, T h. boettgeri and T. marginata was examined in captivity in southern and northern Europe. The CI was calculated using mass-length relationships of wild tortoises: log (M/M'), where M is observed mass and M' is mass predicted from length. The mass-length relationships differed slightly between the subspecies of T hermanni. Captive tortoises at the Centro Carapax (Italy) and the Oosterbeek Tortoise Study Centre (The Netherlands) had CI within the same range as wild tortoises, so there was no general effect of captivity on body mass condition even at densities ten times the highest observed in the wild. However, the seasonal pattern of CI at Oosterbeek differed significantly from that of wild tortoises, with a peak in late summer rather than in spring. Low CI of tortoises in some enclosures at the Centro Carapax prompted supplementary feeding before their health was affected. Tortoises at SOPTOM (France) during a period of disease had significantly lower CI than wild tortoises, with mean CI of -0.04 and mean relative mass (M/M') of 91%. The CI offers a useful guide to the health and management of captive Mediterranean tortoises, although further data are required on those kept in different circumstances, such as outdoor-only enclosures in northern Europe.

AB  - Top predators may adapt their diets to changes in prey availability where human-induced environmental changes are intense. This long-term study of the breeding-season diet of Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) in the Strandzha Mountains analyzed shifts in diet caused by the population decline in principal prey species, the tortoises (Testudo hermanni and T. graeca). Tortoises comprised 50.0% of the eagle diet by prey number in the 1990s, but that share collapsed to 5.8% in 2014-2021. During this later interval, Golden Eagles preyed more intensively on lighter-weight prey such as Northern Whitebreasted Hedgehog (Erinaceus roumanicus, an increase of 28.2% by number) and Edible Dormouse (Glis glis, an increase of 14.9% by number). Hedgehogs predominated in the diet of an individual eagle nest site for the first time in 1998 and became the principal prey in 2014-2021. Differences in food niche breadth and proportions of mesopredators between tortoise- and hedgehog-dominated individual annual diets were not significant, corresponding to a low level of food stress. The only eagle with an annual diet dominated by Squamata (snakes and lizards) was an exception, having the widest food niche. Young domestic ungulates have almost completely disappeared from eagle diets at the same as the reduction of tortoises, corresponding to a concurrent decline of livestock farming. The results obtained here have relevance to conservation management of both predator and prey populations.

AB  - The Leopard Tortoise (Geochelone pardalis) is the largest of the southern African species and has a wide distribution encompassing a variety of habitats. There is a paucity of ecological information about Leopard Tortoises in these habitats. The goal of this study was to determine the population density, biomass, sex and age distributions, and morphometrics of Leopard Tortoises on farmland in the semi-arid Nama-Karoo. Because previous studies have found that body size distributions vary between mesic and xeric habitats, we expected that these Leopard Tortoises would show an increased body size compared to those from more mesic areas. In addition, we expected lower densities of Leopard Tortoises compared to more mesic areas. In total, 92 tortoises were caught with a male to female sex ratio of 1:1.3 that was not significantly different from unity. Adult females were significantly larger than males with respect to all morphometric measurements. Leopard Tortoises (excluding juveniles) were larger than those from more mesic areas. A population estimate of 57.6 +/- 4.0 tortoises in a 5500 ha area was obtained using a mark-recapture sampling method and radio-telemetry. Density of tortoises was extremely low at 0.017 tortoises ha(-1), with a biomass of 0.002 kg ha(-1). Population density and biomass were lower compared with Leopard Tortoise populations in more mesic areas. This has implications for the understanding of fitness parameters and conservation of this species in semiarid areas.

AB  - While electrophoresis is considered the standard method for evaluation of protein concentrations as a result of its direct measurement, albumin is often quantified with biochemical assays. Many laboratory-based chemistry analyzers and clinic-based point-of-care analyzers use the dye bromocresol green (BCG) for the quantitation of albumin. Several studies have shown that albumin concentrations obtained by the standard (BCG) dye-binding method are significantly different from those obtained by protein electrophoresis in avian species and chelonia. The goal of this study was to compare plasma albumin concentrations obtained by the BCG method with those derived from electrophoresis in bearded dragons (Pogona vitticeps). Thirty-six heparinized plasma samples were obtained from 13 clinically healthy male bearded dragons. Albumin was quantified by protein electrophoresis and by the BCG dye-binding method. The two methods were significantly different (P < 0.0001, paired t-test; P < 0.0001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), with the BCG measurement always equal to or higher than the electrophoretic result. The measurements from both methods were significantly correlated (r = 0.8634, P < 0.0001), but concordance between the two techniques was poor. The Bland-Altman plot appeared to show a greater difference between the two measurements with lower albumin values and lesser difference with higher values. These results indicate that bearded dragon plasma albumin concentration measurements obtained by the BCG dye-binding method are unreliable when compared to those obtained with electrophoresis, suggesting that albumin should be measured by protein electrophoresis for health assessment in bearded dragons.

AB  - Box turtles Terrapene carolina are long-lived vertebrates found in many habitats throughout eastern North America. Because they routinely live >30-70 years, individuals and populations likely face periodic catastrophic effects from habitat alteration, such as hurricanes and other violent storms, flooding, and climatic perturbations such as cold or drought. We used a dataset based on a 16-year mark-recapture study of a Florida box turtle population inhabiting an isolated island to model the effects of rare and chronic removal of individuals from the population. 'Removing' individuals based on actual sampling records allowed us to compare the resulting effects on population structure and persistence with the known demographic characteristics of the population. For the increasing population, removal had no effect on population size over a projected 50-year time span. However, only the increasing population could sustain an annual loss of up to 56 individuals (3.8% of our initial model population) per year. Beyond this level of annual removal, the population would eventually go extinct. Both the stable and declining populations were projected to become extinct by year 50, regardless of removal intensity. Irrespective of frequency, a pre-reproductive season loss leads to a smaller population than a post-reproductive season loss. These results have implications for understanding the effect of individual removal on population persistence of declining box turtle populations.

AB  - Body condition indices (BCI - mass scaled by size) are widely used in ecological studies. They presumably reflect variations of endogenous fat reserves in free-ranging animals. In the field, however, accurately quantifying internal body reserves is a difficult task. This is especially true in armoured animals where convenient clues that may guide BCI assessment (e.g. visible subcutaneous fat deposits) remain inaccessible. Alternatively, inclusive dissections may provide anatomical abacuses to estimate body reserves in living individuals. Sacrificing animals for this purpose is not acceptable. We opportunistically tested the ability of BCI to estimate body reserves in 13 free-ranging Hermann's tortoises (Gmelin, 1789) dissected soon after they died from natural causes. On average, BCI values were lower in dissected tortoises relative to living individuals (N > 10,000 measurements), but they remained within the range of variation of the studied populations. Shell mass relative to body mass was high and showed considerable inter-individual variation (33.5% to 52.3%). Stomach and digestive tract content represented another important and variable part of total body mass (4.4% to 14.5%). The contribution of fat bodies was negligible (0.0% to 0.5%). Overall, in the studied tortoises, variations of body condition are weakly determined by variations of fat stores. Other endogenous (e.g. muscles, visceral tissues, liver) and "exogenous" (e.g. digestive tract content, clutch) elements should be considered to better understand age and sex specific life-history trade-offs faced by chelonians.

AB  - Ranaviral disease in amphibians has been studied intensely during the last decade, as associated mass-mortality events are considered to be a global threat to wild animal populations. Several studies have also included other susceptible ectothermic vertebrates (fish and reptiles), but only very few cases of ranavirus infections in lizards have been previously detected. In this study, we focused on clinically suspicious lizards and tested these animals for the presence of ranaviruses. Virological screening of samples from lizards with increased mortality and skin lesions over a course of four years led to the detection of ranaviral infections in seven different groups. Affected species were: brown anoles (Anolis sagrei), Asian glass lizards (Dopasia gracilis), green anoles (Anolis carolinensis), green iguanas (Iguana iguana), and a central bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps). Purulent to ulcerative-necrotizing dermatitis and hyperkeratosis were diagnosed in pathological examinations. All animals tested positive for the presence of ranavirus by PCR and a part of the major capsid protein (MCP) gene of each virus was sequenced. Three different ranaviruses were isolated in cell culture. The analyzed portions of the MCP gene from each of the five different viruses detected were distinct from one another and were 98.4-100% identical to the corresponding portion of the frog virus 3 (FV3) genome. This is the first description of ranavirus infections in these five lizard species. The similarity in the pathological lesions observed in these different cases indicates that ranaviral infection may be an important differential diagnosis for skin lesions in lizards.

AB  - Armoured animals generally exhibit two main antipredator responses: They either flee or stay motionless, withdrawn in their protective armour. The transition between these two threat reactions can be affected by the degree of armour sturdiness. Tortoise shell stiffness gradually increases through ontogeny due to ossification. Additionally, neonates do not benefit from parental protection. Thus, juvenile survival could rely strongly on behavioural adaptations. This experimental approach addresses the effects of age (size), morphology, sex and population of origin on the transition between the two strategies. Predator attack was simulated by overturning individuals on their backs. Juveniles displayed bolder threat response comparing to adults. They also spent shorter periods of time withdrawn in shells and inspecting surroundings. Immature tortoises from all localities had high self-righting success, contrary to adults. The deterioration of righting success coincides with age of sexual maturation. Prompt switch from hiding to fleeing strategy in threatened juvenile tortoises implies that natural selection acts strongly on their swiftness and agility. Sexes did not diverge in antipredator displays. Self-righting speed correlated with shell shape in both juveniles and adults. Morphological measurements used in this study affected self-righting speed only in adults. These effects were accompanied with a general negative effect of increase in body size. Further studies should explore how frequency of predator encounters (i.e. experience) shape antipredator behaviour of tortoises. This could have conservation implications, especially for efficient releasing of animals from captive breeding programs.

AB  - Psammobates geometricus has a limited distribution in the southwestern Cape, South Africa, where it occurs in small habitat fragments separated by agricultural and urban developments. Space use and its determining factors thus represent critical information for the effective conservation of this species. We used radiotelemetry and thread-trailing to study the movement patterns and space use of geometric tortoises over an annual cycle, and estimated home ranges with minimum convex polygons and fixed-kernel methods. Home range size of geometric tortoises showed large inter-individual variation, and for females, a positive relationship to body size. Females, the larger sex, had larger home ranges and mean daily displacements than males had. Female space use was high through most of the year, except in the wet season, when food was abundant, temperatures relatively low, and soft soils allowed easy nesting. Males used more space and displaced further in the non-nesting than nesting season, perhaps to optimise mating opportunities in the non-nesting season before females ovulate. Home ranges were more elongate and overlapped more in fallow fields than in natural vegetation, suggesting that habitat degradation alters home range structure. The space geometric tortoises used for their annual activities ranged from 1.02 to 44.85 ha. The large home ranges and effects of habitat degradation should influence the size of reserves, and the destiny of geometric tortoises in small habitat fragments.

AB  - The sulcata or African spurred tortoise (Centrochelys sulcata) is a large tortoise species that is commonly kept in zoologic collections and as a pet. The objectives of this study were to establish reference intervals for selected biochemical analytes in clinically healthy captive sulcata tortoises and to evaluate the impact of blood sampling site and sex. Blood samples were collected from 60 tortoises from either the dorsal coccygeal (tail) vein or the subcarapacial venous plexus based on their body size. The packed cell volume and refractometric total solids (TS) were determined. The concentrations of selected plasma biochemical analytes were determined using the VetScan VS2 analyzer and included albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, bile acids, calcium, creatine kinase, globulins, glucose, potassium, sodium, phosphorous, total proteins (TP), and uric acid. The calcium-tophosphorous ratio was calculated. Reference intervals were determined and evaluated for the potential effects of blood sampling site and sex. There were significant differences (P < 0.05) associated with the blood sampling site in TS, TP, phosphorus, and globulins, with higher values in samples from the tail versus the subcarapacial sampling site. No significant statistical differences were noted in the plasma biochemistry analytes between the sexes. Reading of the globulins by the analyzer failed in 36 of 60 of the samples and was largely associated with the subcarapacial plexus sampling site. The reference intervals defined by the VetScan analyzer in this study can be used for clinical medicine and conservation of this tortoise species. Sampling site was identified as a factor significantly affecting some blood analytes in this study; this factor should thus be taken into consideration when assessing sulcata tortoise health status and using this testing methodology.

AB  - Golden Eagles are resident in Greece and known to feed mainly on tortoises when breeding. However, information on alternative prey is scarce, especially during the tortoise brumation, that roughly coincides with the eagles' non-breeding season. We analyzed 827 prey items collected from 12 territories over five territory years and 84 records of eagles hunting or feeding behavior. Tortoises dominated the breeding season diet (71% of prey categories on average) and over half of all hunting/feeding observations. While no spatial structure was evident, habitat variables such as forest canopy cover were important associates in golden eagle diet seasonally. A significant seasonal pattern emerged in diet diversity, using a subset of six territories with at least 10 samples per season. Eagles shifted from a narrow, reptile- based breeding season diet dominated by tortoises to a broader non-breeding season diet, that included more carrion, mammals and birds. Breeding season specialization on ectothermic prey is a trait usually associated with migratory raptors in the Western Palearctic. The observed dietary diversity expansion accompanied by residency in the absence of ectothermic prey, highlights the adaptability of the golden eagle, a generalist predator. Tortoise populations in Greece are of conservation concern and land use changes as well as climate change, such as development and land abandonment may increase the prevalence of catastrophic megafires, exacerbating the threats to the golden eagle's main prey when breeding. We discuss this and other diet related conservation implications for the species in northern Greece.

AB  - Juvenile growth strongly impacts life-history traits during adulthood. Yet, in juveniles with delayed maturity, elusiveness has hindered age-specific studies of growth, precluding any detailed research on its consequences later in life. Different complex growth patterns have been extracted from captive animals, suggesting species-specific trajectories occur in free-ranging animals. How pronounced are growth and body size variation (VBS) throughout a long-lived ectotherm's life? Is VBS constant among age classes prior to maturity, or do compensatory and/or cumulative effects driven by long-lived-animal-specific strategies create distinct VBS cohorts, to ensure survival? To tackle the issue, we modelled growth data from continuous and dense annual capture-mark-recapture sampling (5096 body measurements of 1134 free-ranging individuals) of both immature and mature, long-lived Hermann's tortoises. We analysed population, cohort, and individual-based growth and VBS. Growth ring inferred ages were cross validated with annual recaptures in 289 juveniles. Analyses unravelled an S-shaped growth curve and identified three age cohorts across which VBS increases in a step-wise manner. Neonate-specific constraints and compensatory effects seem to control VBS until 4 years of age, possibly promoting survival with size. Subsequently, a hardened carapace takes over and cumulative effects fuelled by faster growth progressively increase VBS. Whereas ungulates are in a hurry to attain adult size before growth ceases (minimizing VBS), indeterminately growing tortoises can shape individual asymptotic sizes even after growth decelerates. Tortoise size is clearly shaped by age-specific ecological constraints; interestingly, it is likely the carapace that conducts the strategy, rather than maturity per se.

AB  - A population of the tortoise Testudo hermanii near Olympia in southern Greece was studied by mark-recapture from 1975 to 1984. Part of the site was sprayed with the herbicides 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) each year from 1980, producing symptoms of poisoning (swollen eyes, fluid discharge from the nose and immobility) in tortoises. Survival rates of tortoises 10 cm or larger were significantly lower in the affected areas, with extra mortality of about 34% year(-1), against an annual survival rate of 0.85-0.90 in unaffected areas. Changing population structures showed that juveniles were even more strongly affected, with the proportion of juveniles in samples decreased by half. The population in the sprayed area declined to near zero by 1984, due to mortality rather than to emigration, since more movements were recorded into than out of the affected area. There was no difference in body mass condition between sprayed and unsprayed areas, showing that effects were acute; mortality was not due to starvation from loss of food plants. The scale and pattern of mortality was similar to that from a severe scrub fire, spraying is potentially more catastrophic since often repeated at shorter intervals than burning. Possible physiological mechanisms of death are discussed. The susceptibility of tortoises to 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T (or to associated dioxin impurities) presents a warning for conservation of these late-maturing animals. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - After 2007, the Bulgarian farmers have started benefiting from the newly available agro-environmental schemes through the European Union, which have promoted significant landscape changes. However, the impact on the local environment and the herpetofauna is yet to be determined. This has prompted us to undertake a comparative study on the changes in the area of habitats in a biodiversity hotspot, Besaparski Ridove Special Protection Area, between 2006 and 2010. We mapped 584 new exact localities of 25 species of herptiles from this site, doubling the previously known localities. Herptiles were detected in 85% of the squares of the 2x2 km UTM grid. Pastures and natural grasslands have decreased by roughly 9%, on account of the increase of non-irrigated and permanently irrigated arable lands; open pastures have decreased by 51%. The most important habitats for the herpetofauna include water bodies, various kinds of pastures and natural grasslands (Chao1 index for expected diversity of species per habitat >= 12). Industrial or commercial units and permanently irrigated lands are the least viable habitats (Chao1 <= 5). Inevitably, loss of suitable habitats through agriculture negatively impacted species, including those of high conservation value: e.g. Elaphe sauromates, Testudo hermanni and Eryx jaculus. Therefore, the conservation of species and habitats might need re-assessment and more stringent national criteria than those enacted by the reformed Common Agricultural Policy (2014-2020).

AB  - Changes in habitat structure constitute a major factor explaining responses of reptiles to fire. However, few studies have examined habitat factors that covary with fire-history variables to explain reptile responses. We hypothesise that more complex habitats should support richer reptile communities, and that species-specific relative abundance should be related to particular habitat features. From spring 2012-2014, twenty-five transects were surveyed in the Albera Region (north-east Iberia). The vegetation structure was measured and the extent of habitat types in a 1000-m buffer around each transect calculated. Reptile-community metrics (species richness and reptile abundance) were related to fire history, vegetation structure, and habitat types, using generalized additive models. These metrics correlated with habitat-structure variables but not with fire history. The number of species increased with more complex habitats but decreased with pine-plantation abundance in the 1000-m buffer. We found contrasting responses among reptiles in terms of time since fire and those responses differed according to vegetation variables and habitat types. An unplanned fire in August 2012 provided the opportunity to compare reptile abundance values between pre-fire and the short term (1-2 years) after the fire. Most species exhibited a negative short-term response to the 2012 fire except Tarentola mauritanica, a gecko that inhabits large rocks, as opposed to other ground-dwelling species. In the reptiles studied, contrasting responses to time since fire are consistent with the habitat-accommodation model of succession. These differences are linked to specific microhabitat preferences and suggest that functional traits can be used to predict species-specific responses to fire.

TI  - DIFFERENCES IN THERMOREGULATION BETWEEN TESTUDO-HERMANNI AND TESTUDO-MARGINATA AND THEIR ECOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE
T2  - HERPETOLOGICAL JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - The activity patterns and body temperatures of T. hermanni and T. marginta were studied in the Peloponnese (southern Greece) during May, June, August and October 1984.
   T. hermanni
   In May the daily activity patterns of T. hermanni were unimodal, in June and August they were bimodal.  In August during the afternoon the activity increased significantly, in October the activity was very low.
   In August basking decreased significantly and mating increased significantly.
   During these four months no significant differences in body temperatures were found.  In May a maximum body temperature of 35-degrees-C was found; in feeding tortoises a maximum temperature of 34-degrees-C.  After May no temperatures over 32-degrees-C were found.
   T. marginata
   In May and June the activity patterns of T. marginata were bimodal with the highest activity during the afternoon.  In August an unimodal low activity pattern was found during the afternoon.  In October the activity of T. marginata was unimodal and shifted towards the middle of the day.  Sexual activity was seen in October only.
   Body temperatures in all T. marginata samples were significantly higher than those in T. hermanni.  During May a maximum body temperature of 36-degrees-C was found in basking tortoises, a maximum of 37-degrees-C in feeding tortoises.
   The trend towards lower body temperatures in summer was greater in T. marginata than in T. hermanni.  Body temperatures found in feeding tortoises in October equalled those found in May.
   Ecological Consequences
   In southern Greece the habitat separation between T. hermanni and T. marginata can be explained by morphological differences and a higher body temperature tolerance in T. marginata.  Differences in the annual cycle of activities might also be of importance as regards the habitat separation between both species.

AB  - Blood samples from 172 captive and 40 wild, healthy, juvenile and adult, ploughshare tortoises (Astrochelys yniphora) were analyzed to determine hematological and biochemical reference intervals. Hematological analytes included packed cell volume (PCV), white blood cell count (WBC), and WBC differential estimates. Biochemical analysis included total protein measured by photometry (TP) and by refractometry (TPr), albumin (ALB), creatine kinase (CK), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), bile acids (BA), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), urea (UREA), and uric acid (UA). The jugular vein was identified as the preferred venipuncture site as subcarapacial vein venipuncture resulted in regular hemodilution. In due consideration of small sample sizes in some of the groups studied, adult tortoises had significantly higher plasma GLDH activity and TPr, TP, ALB, BA, and UREA concentrations and significantly lower AST activity and P concentration than juveniles. Captivity had a significant influence in some reference intervals, with captive adults presenting significantly higher WBC, and estimated counts of all white cell types as well as UREA and TPr than wild counterparts. Captive juveniles also showed significantly higher estimated monocyte and lower estimated eosinophil and basophil counts. Although these differences most likely reflect local environmental or dietary differences, without representing pathology or a deviation from the normal, they question the applicability of reference values from captive animals to wild animals and vice versa. Significant sex differences were only observed for PCV and UA. The reported reference intervals may serve as benchmarks for clinical assessment and conservation of this critically endangered species.

AB  - Although the ability to vocalize is widespread among tortoises, the mechanisms of sound production in chelonians remain undescribed. In this study, we analyze the morphology and histology of the larynx of three species of Testudinidae (Testudo hermanni, T. graeca, and T marginata) in order to ascertain the presence of vibrating acoustic structure, and based on our findings we propose a general model for phonation in tortoises. The structure of the larynx of the three tortoises analyzed is simple: three cartilages (the cricoid and two arytenoids) form the skeleton of the larynx, while two pairs of muscles (the dilators and constrictors) control the widening and closing of the glottis. The larynx is supported in the oral cavity by the hyoid cartilage, which in tortoises assumes the same functions of the thyroid cartilage of mammals. Two bands of elastic fibers are inserted in the lateral walls of the larynx just upstream of the glottis, and can be stretched away from the hyoid by the movements of the arytenoids. Their position and structure suggest that these bands are capable of vibrating during exhalation, and therefore may be considered vocal cords. The cricoid of T. marginata and T graeca hold two diverticula, not previously reported, which might function as a low-frequency resonating chamber, improving the harmonic structure of tortoise calls. The structure of the larynx is compared with that of other vertebrates and the relationships between morphology and phonation are discussed. This is the first detailed description of anatomical structures possibly devoted to vocalization in chelonians. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - This study is a continuation of the description of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunopositive structures in the adult turtle brain (Kalmin et al. 1994) and presents a comprehensive description of the development of these structures from the 20th embryonic day (E20) to the adult age. GFAP-immunopositive elements were first detected at E28 and by E34 the GFAP-immunopositivity was apparent throughout the brain, except the cerebellum. The appearance of GFAP seemed to be related to the end of cell migration and the formation of the thickened parts of the brain wall, such as the dorsal ventricular ridge. After hatching the pattern of the GFAP-immunopositivity differed from that in the adult only in minute details, except for the brain tracts in which GFAP-pattern was still changing due to myelination, and the molecular layer of the cerebellum in which a transverse fiber system appeared. The GFAP-positive elements belonged originally to the ependymoglia, but later the distortion due to the morphogenetic processes of branching and division changed the pattern almost beyond recognition. In some cases cell bodies - ependymal and non-ependymal - appeared to be GFAP-positive, but no astrocytes (i.e., stellate cells) were detected. The results are discussed in the light of previous observations on developing mammalian, avian and lizard brains.

AB  - This study investigates the evolution of a population of Hermann's tortoises, located on the edge of the massif des Maurcs, over a period of 30 years through capture recapture monitoring. It shows a considerable decline of 73% in the number of adult tortoises between the early 1980s and 1999; then from 1999, the population stabilized at around 100 adult tortoises. The fall in numbers during the first period seems to be linked to several factors. The 22% increase in forest cover between 1983 and 1995 increased the concentrations of eggs laid in some open areas, making it easier for the species' natural predators to find them. Mechanized clearance of undergrowth carried out in 1989 and 1994 has undoubtedly reduced the size of the population. The presence of dogs has posed an additional threat (97% of the adult tortoises have bite marks and 7% are missing limbs). In addition, the impact of dog bites on the tortoises' shells has, over time, removed individual markings, thereby distorting survival estimates. The stabilization of numbers over the last decade seems to be due to the discontinuation of certain practices (notably mechanized undergrowth clearance). However, the demographic structure (with almost no juveniles) could soon lead to another decrease in population. This situation seems to be specific to this particular population and cannot be applied generally to all the populations in Provence.

AB  - The leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis) is the largest of southern Africa's 13 tortoise species, and occurs in a variety of habitats from arid and semi-arid areas to mesic grassveld, savanna and bushveld. Seasonal activity patterns of S. pardalis were investigated as a function of rainfall, sex, time of day, temperature and time after sunrise on farmland in the semi-arid Nama-Karoo, South Africa. We predicted that because of seasonal rainfall, and subsequent increase in the food available, activity patterns of leopard tortoises would vary greatly among seasons, but that the primary constraint on activity levels within a season would be ambient temperature. Type of activity, time of day that the activity was performed, and the frequency that each activity was performed, differed among seasons. There was no overall seasonal difference in the level of activity with sex, but in certain seasons and with regard to specific activities, there were significant differences between the sexes. Diel activity was primarily bimodal in summer and autumn, and unimodal in winter and spring, with non-thermoregulatory activities being performed primarily in the afternoon. There was a positive correlation between number of tortoises caught and rainfall per season, but activity levels and number of tortoises walking and feeding was not correlated with seasonal rainfall. Leopard tortoise activity behaviours responded to ambient temperature, but results indicate that activity is also initiated by the time since sunrise.

AB  - Adult body size and shape were examined in almost 1400 individuals of the tortoises Testudo graeca, T. hermanni and T. marginata from Greece. The size at maturity was greater in females than in males in all three species. Maximum and mean adult sizes were also greater in females than in males in T. graeca and T. hermanni. Males grew to a larger size than females in T. marginata, and mean adult size was similar in the sexes in this species. Sexual dimorphism of shape (adjusted for size covariate) was shown in most of the characters examined, and the degree of this dimorphism differed significantly among the three species. Differences were related to their contrasting courtship behaviours: horizontal head movements and severe biting in T. marginata, vertical head bobs and carapace butting in T. graeca, and mounting and tail thrusting in T. hermanni. There was no difference in the frequency of observations of courtship or fighting among the three species, but courtship was about 10 times more common than combat in males. All species showed greatest courtship activity in autumn; copulation was rarely observed in T. hermanni (only 0.36% of courting males) and not seen in the other species in the field. Observations made throughout the activity season indicated that feeding was equally common in males and females in all three species. Differences in shape were more likely to be the result of sexual selection than of natural selection for fecundity. Detailed predictions are made for sexual dimorphism of other characters in these species.

AB  - Frog virus 3 (FV3) and FV3-like viruses are members of the genus Ranavirus (family Iridoviridae) and are becoming recognized as significant pathogens of eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina) in North America. In July 2011, 5 turtles from a group of 27 in Maryland, USA, presented dead or lethargic with what was later diagnosed as fibrinonecrotic stomatitis and cloacitis. The presence of FV3-like virus and herpesvirus was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the tested index cases. The remaining 22 animals were isolated, segregated by severity of clinical signs, and treated with nutritional support, fluid therapy, ambient temperature management, antibiotics, and antiviral therapy. Oral swabs were tested serially for FV3-like virus by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and tested at day 0 for herpesvirus and Mycoplasma sp. by conventional PCR. With oral swabs, 77% of the 22 turtles were FV3-like virus positive; however, qPCR on tissues taken during necropsy revealed the true prevalence was 86%. FV3-like virus prevalence and the median number of viral copies being shed significantly declined during the outbreak. The prevalence of herpesvirus and Mycoplasma sp. by PCR of oral swabs at day 0 was 55% and 68%, respectively. The 58% survival rate was higher than previously reported in captive eastern box turtles for a ranavirus epizootic. All surviving turtles brumated normally and emerged the following year with no clinical signs during subsequent monitoring. The immediate initiation of treatment and intensive supportive care were considered the most important contributing factors to the successful outcome in this outbreak.

AB  - In North America, the spatio-temporal scale of deforestation has resulted in a 94% decrease in temperate forests within 360 years. Despite the enormous scale of this disturbance, agriculture is so pervasive in modern society that its impacts are highly underappreciated. We investigated the impact of current agricultural practices on a disturbance-dependent species in southern Quebec, Canada. Of 30 wood turtles (Glyptemys insculpta) followed via radio-telemetry, 20% died as a result of agricultural activities. Anthropogenic mortality estimates for adults and juveniles in 1998 were 0.10 and 0.18, respectively. For 1999, these values were 0.13 and 0.17, respectively. Of those turtles that survived, many had injuries inflicted by agricultural machinery. Sub-lethal mutilation rates for adults were, 90 +/- 3% in both years, whereas the maximum frequency for juveniles was 57%. A Carapace Mutilation Index was derived to quantify the distribution and severity of injuries observed. only male and juvenile Carapace Mutilation Index values differed significantly. Adults had significantly more carapace injuries and limb amputations on their right sides. This bilateral asymmetry of injuries resulted from of a combination of turtle flight behavior and traditional harvesting practices. We reiterate the recommendations of forage researchers: setting the cutting height of disc mowers to 100 mm increases harvest yields, reduces wear on machinery, and decreases soil erosion. A by-product of such a change in cutting height is that turtle mortality and injury rates should be reduced, as wood turtle carapace height is < 87 mm. Without changes in agricultural practices, this population will be extirpated. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Members of the genus Iridovirus (invertebrate iridoviruses [IIVs]) of the Iridoviridae family infect a wide range of invertebrates, mainly arthropods, but there have also been a few reports from other taxa. The cricket iridovirus described recently has been shown to infect a wide host range among insect orders and has also been described in several diseased reptiles. This virus together with the type species Chilo iridescent virus form a distinct "group II'' in the genus. The aim of this study was to develop a fast and easy real-time polymerase chain reaction [quantitative (q)PCR] for the detection of these group II iridoviruses. In silico and in vitro assays demonstrated that the designed TaqMan primer-probe combination targeting a portion of the major capsid protein is specific for this group of IIVs. A sensitivity assay showed that it is able to detect as little as one copy of viral DNA. Direct comparison of cell culture isolation, nested (n)PCR, and qPCR methods has shown that PCR methods are 10(2)-10(3) more sensitive compared with the isolation method. In testing the three methods on routine diagnostic samples from lizards (n = 22) and crickets (n = 11), the nPCR and qPCR results were consistent with 19 positive lizards and 10 positive crickets, respectively, whereas isolation on cell culture detected only seven and six positives, respectively. QPCR is a fast, sensitive, and specific diagnostic method. Furthermore, it requires fewer handling steps than were previously required. It also allows the quantitation and comparison of the amounts of IIV DNA in samples.

AB  - The pineal complex of reptiles is a morphologically and functionally connected set of organs that originates as an evagination of the roof of the diencephalon. It is formed by two structures: the pineal organ and the parietal eye. The pineal gland is present in Chelonia, Squamata and Rhynchocephalia, but not in Crocodilia. The parietal eye is present in some species of lizards (Squamata) and in the tuatara (Rhynchocephalia). Both the pineal gland and the parietal eye are photosensitive. In particular, the parietal eye is an highly organized photoreceptive structure, with a well-defined lens, cornea and retina. The most important (and studied) secretory product of this complex is the hormone melatonin which is synthesized by both organs (pineal and parietal eye). The pineal organ is believed to be the neuroendocrine transducer of changes in photoperiod and environmental temperature and it has been demonstrated to have a functional role in many aspects of reptilian biology. Melatonin has an influence on the mechanisms controlling thermoregulation (behavioral and physiological), because its manipulation or removal may produce significant alterations of behavioral and physiological thermoregulatory parameters. The reptilian pineal complex may also possess self-sustained circadian oscillators which are involved in the circadian organization of these animals and in their reproduction. It is believed that many of the roles played by the pineal complex are mediated by the hormone melatonin, since exogenous administration of melatonin may affect the animal's physiology and/or behavior. The present paper will review the current knowledge about the neuroendocrinology and functional roles of the reptilian pineal complex.

AB  - Captive chelonians should be fed a natural diet to achieve a growth rate similar to that of free-ranging animals. A wide range of commercially formulated foods dedicated to chelonians is available. Feeding commercial foods has the advantage of convenience. On the other hand, species-specific information on the nutritional requirements of chelonians is not available yet. The aim of this study was to analyse and evaluate commercial pellets and feeds for chelonians. Commercial pellets (ntortoise = 7, nturtle = 7, from 6 companies) dedicated to carnivorous aquatic turtles and herbivorous terrestrial tortoises, and other aquatic turtle feeds (lyophilised beef heart, dried aquatic invertebrates, and whole frozen fish) were bought in pet shops. Whole frozen fish served as a reference feed for carnivorous aquatic turtles. The chemical composition as well as calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) contents were determined. Single-sample t-test was used with the label information as null hypothesis and the results of own parallel analyses for crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), crude fibre (CF), Ca and P. The labelling of some of the pellets was deficient as nutritive values, Ca or P data were missing (tortoise pellets: 4 out of 7; turtle pellets: 5 out of 7). The label data differed significantly (p<0.05) from the results of our own analysis for 13 out of the 14 pellets. None of the tortoise pellets met the requirements of the animals completely. Because of the inadequate Ca:P ratio only one turtle pellet could be accepted. Accordingly, none of the commercial pellets can be recommended as main or only feed.

AB  - Background: Contrast-enhanced diagnostic imaging techniques are considered useful in veterinary and human medicine to evaluate liver perfusion and focal hepatic lesions. Although hepatic diseases are a common occurrence in reptile medicine, there is no reference to the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) to evaluate the liver in lizards. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the pattern of change in echogenicity and attenuation of the liver in green iguanas (Iguana iguana) after administration of specific contrast media.
   Results: An increase in liver echogenicity and density was evident during CEUS and CECT, respectively. In CEUS, the mean +/- SD (median; range) peak enhancement was 19.9% +/- 7.5 (18.3; 11.7-34.6). Time to peak enhancement was 134.0 +/- 125.1 (68.4; 59.6-364.5) seconds. During CECT, first visualization of the contrast medium was at 3.6 +/- 0.5 (4; 3-4) seconds in the aorta, 10.7 +/- 2.2 (10.5; 7-14) seconds in the hepatic arteries, and 15 +/- 4.5 (14.5; 10-24) seconds in the liver parenchyma. Time to peak was 14.1 +/- 3.4 (13; 11-21) and 31 +/- 9.6 (29; 23-45) seconds in the aorta and the liver parenchyma, respectively.
   Conclusion: CEUS and dynamic CECT are practical means to determine liver hemodynamics in green iguanas. Distribution of contrast medium in iguana differed from mammals. Specific reference ranges of hepatic perfusion for diagnostic evaluation of the liver in iguanas are necessary since the use of mammalian references may lead the clinician to formulate incorrect diagnostic suspicions.

AB  - Twenty-five years after the preliminary systematic study of the turtle remains (Agrionemys [=Testudo] hermanni and Emys or Mauremys) recovered from Gruta Nova da Columbeira site (Bombarral, Portugal), the results of its review from systematic and archaeozoological perspectives are presented here. Tortoise remains studies from pre-Upper Paleolithic sites worldwide have provided relevant data confirming its role as a dietary supply for hominid populations and informing about their ability to adapt to local environmental resources. The Iberian Peninsula record in general, and specifically, that from Portugal, have yielded substantial evidence to this highly debated topic. In this sense, turtle remains recovered in Gruta Nova da Columbeira site, discovered in the 1960s and the main ensemble chronologically ascribed to the MIS-5 (87.1 +/- 6.3 ka BP), offer new information to this debate. Its detailed restudy, has allowed us the identification, justification, and figuration of remains attributed to two Iberian turtle taxa, Chersine hermanni and Emys orbicularis. Therefore, this update on the data concerning the turtle record from Gruta Nova da Columbeira provides new justified taxonomic evidence regarding the Iberian turtle taxa distribution during the Upper Pleistocene. The previously suggested hypothesis about the tortoise human consumption on the site is here evaluated through the development of an archaeozoological and taphonomical analysis, as well as considering the potential documentation of anthropic alterations (e.g., burning, cutmarks, percussion marks). In this sense, this hypothesis is confirmed. In addition, the presence of carnivore activity evidence indicates the engagement of other agents in the deposit formation.

AB  - We studied the long-term response of a cohort of eight female Agassiz's desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) during the first 15 years following a large fire at a wind energy generation facility near Palm Springs, California, USA. The fire burned a significant portion of the study site in 1995. Tortoise activity areas were mapped using minimum convex polygons for a proximate post-fire interval from 1997 to 2000, and a long-term post-fire interval from 2009 to 2010. In addition, we measured the annual reproductive output of eggs each year and monitored the body condition of tortoises over time. One adult female tortoise was killed by the fire and five tortoises bore exposure scars that were not fatal. Despite predictions that tortoises would make the short-distance movements from burned to nearby unburned habitats, most activity areas and their centroids remained in burned areas for the duration of the study. The percentage of activity area burned did not differ significantly between the two monitoring periods. Annual reproductive output and measures of body condition remained statistically similar throughout the monitoring period. Despite changes in plant composition, conditions at this site appeared to be suitable for survival of tortoises following a major fire. High productivity at the site may have buffered tortoises from the adverse impacts of fire if they were not killed outright. Tortoise populations at less productive desert sites may not have adequate resources to sustain normal activity areas, reproductive output, and body conditions following fire.

AB  - Calcium and phosphorus are very important minerals in reptile nutrition, but many diets are still not balanced. To achieve optimal growth, including a healthy skeleton and a strong shell, a well-balanced supply with these minerals is prerequisite. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the apparent digestibility in Hermann's tortoises of diets with different calcium levels with special emphasis on the digestibility of minerals. Eight adult Hermann's tortoises of the veterinary faculty in Zurich were used. The animals were housed indoors at a mean temperature between 23 degrees C and 26 degrees C. The animals were fed a diet, which consisted of vegetables, herbs and different supplementation of calcium carbonate. Daily faecal samples of all tortoises were collected from day 8 to day 12. A proximate analysis was performed and the HCl-insoluble ash was used as an indigestible natural indicator (marker) for the determination of the apparent digestibility of minerals. The calcium content of the mixed feedstuffs of diet I was 0.64% on a dry matter basis, and the Ca: P ratio in the food was 3:1. In diet II the Ca content was 1.29% on a dry matter basis, and the Ca: P ratio in the food was 6:1. The digestibility of Ca in diet I was 57%. The other examined minerals, Mg and P, had a digestibility of 46% and 58% respectively. In diet II the digestibility of Ca was 79%, of Mg 52% and of P 52%. The results of this study indicated, that higher Ca concentrations in the diet led to an increased apparent digestibility of Ca and Mg.

AB  - The goals of this study were to evaluate electrophoretograms in green iguanas suffering from hepatic, renal and inflammatory skin diseases. Plasma samples were obtained from 14 green iguana patients. The diagnosis was based on clinical examination, evaluation of biochemical and haematological profiles or histopathological examination. Agarose gel electrophoresis was performed using an automated HYDRASYS system. A decrease in the albumin/globulin ratio was observed in 11 out of 14 patients (three out of four patients with liver failure, one out of one patient with chronic renal insufficiency and suspected hepatopathy, two out of two patients with chronic interstitial nephritis, four out of five patients with chronic renal insufficiency and one out of two patients with dermatitis). The alpha globulin fraction was elevated in 1 out of 14 patients (patient with dermatitis). The fraction of beta globulins was increased in 8 out of 14 patients (two out of four patients with liver diseases, four out of eight patients with various forms of renal failure and two out of two patients with inflammatory skin diseases). Increased gamma globulin levels were observed in 4 out of 14 patients (one out of four patients with impaired function of the liver, two out of eight patients with renal diseases and one out of two patients with dermatitis). Changes in the electrophoretograms of green iguanas are not disease-specific, but in conjunction with other biochemical blood tests the electrophoresis of plasma proteins may be a useful indicator in the diagnosis of metabolic and infectious diseases and in the monitoring of disease progress.

AB  - Iridoviruses of the genus Ranavirus are well known for causing mass mortality events of fish and amphibians with sporadic reports of infection in reptiles. This article describes five instances of Ranavirus infection in chelonians between 2003 and 2005 in Georgia, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania, USA. Affected species included captive Burmese star tortoises (Geochelone platynota), a free-ranging gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus), free-ranging eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina), and a Florida box turtle (Terrepene carolina bauri). Evidence for Ranavirus infection was also found in archived material from previously unexplained mass mortality events of eastern box turtles from Georgia in 1991 and from Texas in 1998. Consistent lesions in affected animals included necrotizing stomatitis and/or esophagitis, fibrinous and necrotizing splenitis, and multicentric fibrinoid vasculitis. Intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies were rarely observed in affected tissues. A portion of the major capsid protein (MCP) gene was sequenced from each case in 2003-2005 and found to be identical to each other and to Frog virus 3 (FV3) across 420 base pairs. Ranavirus infections were also documented in sympatric species of amphibians at two locations with infected chelonians. The fragment profiles of HindIII-digested whole genomic DNA of Ranavirus, isolated from a dead Burmese star tortoise and a southern leopard frog (Rana utricularia) found new-by, were similar. The box turtle isolate had a low molecular weight fragment that was not seen in the digestion profiles for the other isolates. These results suggest that certain amphibians and chelonians are infected with a similar virus and that different viruses exist among different chelonians. Amphibians may serve as a reservoir host for susceptible chelonians. This report also demonstrated that significant disease associated with Ranavirus infections are likely more widespread in chelonians than previously suspected.

AB  - Peripheral arterial chemoreceptors have been isolated to the common carotid artery, aorta, and pulmonary artery of turtles. However, the putative neurotransmitters associated with these chemoreceptors have not yet been described. The goal of the present study was to determine the neurochemical content, innervations, and distribution of putative oxygen-sensing cells in the central vasculature of turtles and to derive homologies with peripheral arterial chemoreceptors of other vertebrates. We used tract tracing together with immunohistochemical markers for cholinergic cells (vesicular acetylcholine transporter [VAChT]), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis), and serotonin (5HT) to identify putative oxygen-sensing cells and to determine their anatomical relation to branches of the vagus nerve (Xth cranial nerve). We found potential oxygen-sensing cells in all three chemosensory areas innervated by branches of the Xth cranial nerve. Cells containing either 5HT or VAChT were found in all three sites. The morphology and size of these cells resemble glomus cells found in amphibians, mammals, tortoises, and lizards. Furthermore, we found populations of cholinergic cells located at the base of the aorta and pulmonary artery that are likely involved in efferent regulation of vessel resistance. Catecholamine-containing cells were not found in any of the putative chemosensitive areas. The presence of 5HT- and VAChT-immunoreactive cells in segments of the common carotid artery, aorta, and pulmonary artery appears to reflect a transition between cells containing the major neurotransmitters seen in fish (5HT) and mammals (ACh and adenosine).

AB  - We tested samples from 1,015 chelonians in Europe for Mycoplasma spp., herpesviruses, ranaviruses, picornaviruses, and ferlaviruses by PCR. Mycoplasma spp. were detected in 42.1% and herpesviruses were detected in 8.0% of tested chelonians. Differentiation of the herpesviruses revealed that 46.9% of the detected chelonian viruses were testudinid herpesvirus 1 (TeHV-1) and 54.3% were TeHV-3, including co-detections of TeHV-1 and -3 in 3 tortoises. TeHV-4 was detected in a leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis), and a herpesvirus that could not be further characterized was found in a pond slider (Trachemys scripta). Picornaviruses (topiviruses) were detected in 2.2% of the tested animals; ferlaviruses were found in 0.6%; no ranaviruses were detected in any of the animals tested. Mycoplasma spp. were detected significantly more often in Horsfield's tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii), leopard tortoises, and Indian star tortoises (Geochelone elegans) than in other species. Horsfield's tortoises were also significantly more often positive for TeHV-1. Mycoplasma and TeHV-1 were co-detected in 3.0%, and mycoplasma and TeHV-3 in 2.3%. The TeHV-4-positive tortoise was also positive for mycoplasma. Mycoplasma and picornaviruses were co-detected in 1.2% of the tortoises. A spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) was positive for mycoplasma and a ferlavirus. In some cases, >2 pathogens were detected. A significant correlation between mycoplasma and herpesvirus detection was found. Of all tested animals, 47.6% were positive for at least one pathogen, demonstrating the importance of pathogen detection in captive chelonians.

AB  - Fire is one of the main disturbances to terrestrial environments, transforming habitat structure and affecting community composition. Coupled with fire, forest type and vegetation structure modulate the taxonomic response to fire by ectotherm organisms such as reptiles. The response of each reptile species to fire is based on their functional attributes, which make some species resilient to fire and others vulnerable to that disturbance and only adapted to long-unburnt landscapes. We studied the functional response of a reptile community at 13 burnt sites within the African rim of the Western Mediterranean, and in two contrasting forest types, i.e. native cork oak forests (five sites) and pine plantations (eight sites). We compiled seven functional traits for the reptile species in the study areas, and quantified reptile functional diversity at each sampled plot. Variation in this index was examined from burnt to nearby unburnt plots, both in cork oak and pine forests, with generalized linear mixed models. Redundancy analysis was used to identify which functional traits were associated with particular plot types. We found 2149 individual reptiles from 15 species. The functional response of reptiles to fire was forest-type dependent: functional richness did not change with fire in cork oak forest plots, but increased with fire in the pine plantation ones. High reptile functional richness in cork oak plots was due to high species richness in this forest type. The functional-redundancy analysis showed that cork oak forest hosts a reptile community functionally composed of small Mediterranean ground- and rock-dwelling lizards. In pine plantation plots, however, saxicolous geckos and phytophagous tortoises indicate the availability of other microhabitat and food resources to be exploited by reptile species with different functional traits.

AB  - Population catastrophes are widespread, unpredictable phenomena occurring in natural populations that have important, yet frequently underappreciated, consequences for persistence. As human impacts on ecosystems increase globally, the frequency of catastrophes is likely to rise as increasingly fragmented and depleted populations become more vulnerable. Species with slow life histories are expected to recover slowly from catastrophes because of their longer generation times, and assessing their population recovery requires data spanning long periods. We report results from a long-term mark-recapture study of snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, that experienced a major mortality event from winter predation by river otters. We estimated abundance and survival of nesting females before, during, and 23 yr following the catastrophe. We built multistate mark-recapture models incorporating movement between sites, temporary emigration, and observation effects. We found that during the 3-yr mortality event, abundance of nesting females declined by 39% overall, and by 49% at our focal nesting area. Apparent survivorship of nesting females during these three years fell from 0.94 before the mortality event to 0.76 at the focal site and 0.86 at adjacent nest sites. Survivorship over the following 23-yr period averaged 0.972 and 0.940 at the two sampling areas. Despite high post-catastrophe survivorship and connectivity with other populations, the population failed to recover, displaying consistently reduced abundances across 23 post-catastrophe years. We discuss the relationship between life-history attributes and the causes and consequences of local catastrophes and their conservation implications.

AB  - In this study I reviewed the studies on the community organization of terrestrial turtles to examine the main patterns of resource partitioning, and to predict whether interspecific competition may be or may not be an important organizing force for these ectotherms. These reptiles exhibit four (nearly) constant ecological/life-history traits that may affect the role and the influence of interspecific competition: (i) low species richness, (ii) high longevity, (iii) herbivorous/omnivorous dietary habits, and (iv) low population density. Based on the expectations derived from these ecological characteristics, I predicted that interspecific competition should be of lesser relevance for these turtle communities than for other reptilian communities (lizards, snakes). After reviewing the international literature, I concluded that most of the turtle communities around the world appear currently uninfluenced by interspecific competition. Much of their species diversity reflects geographic replacement of one species by another. In the regions of the world where two or more species are sympatric, current interspecific competition is also of relatively low importance, because the sympatric species tend to partition very clearly the spatial axis or the food axis. By Monte Carlo simulations of niche overlap data versus current niche overlap data at a geographic region in tropical Africa where the community ecology of three sympatric species of terrestrial turtles, three of scincid lizards, four of chameleons, and nineteen of snakes, was accurately studied, I concluded that the interspecific competition among turtles was statistically lower than that among these other reptiles, with the spatial niche being the niche dimension most clearly partitioned by turtles in comparison with the other ectotherms. Hence, terrestrial turtles would be unusual among reptiles with respect to the un-influence of the competition process for their community ecology.

AB  - Background Thyroid hormones and capillary zone electrophoresis are rarely studied in reptile medicine.
   Objectives The goal of this prospective study was to establish RIs for plasma proteins and thyroid hormones, total tetraiodothyronine (tT4), free T4 (fT4), total triiodothyronine (tT3), and free T3 (fT3), as well as iodine blood levels in red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) and map turtles (Graptemys spp.).
   Methods Variables were measured over 1 1/2 years to determine variations depending on sex and season, as well as any correlations between the parameters. A total of 131 blood samples from red-eared sliders and 51 blood samples from map turtles were collected from May 2016 to November 2017. The levels of tT4, fT4, and fT3 were measured using standardized autoanalyzer test systems; tT3 was measured by ELISA and iodine inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Total protein was quantitated using the biuret method, and plasma protein fractions were measured using capillary zone electrophoresis.
   Results The results showed significant variations in thyroid hormone levels and plasma protein fractions depending on sex and season. Total T4 and fT4 concentrations were significantly (P < .05) correlated in both turtle species and sexes in all seasons. Thyroid hormone levels correlated with blood proteins in a few seasons, including a positive correlation between tT4 and fT4 in female red-eared sliders in fall and female map turtles in summer and fall.
   Conclusions This study demonstrates the importance of considering species, season, and sex variations when interpreting thyroid hormone and plasma protein levels. It also shows that thyroid hormone levels are not always influenced by total protein and albumin.

AB  - The turtle's cerebellum (Cb) is an unfoliated sheet, so the topography of its entire cortex can be easily studied physiologically by optical recordings. However, unlike the mammalian Cb, little is known about the topography of turtle Purkinje cells (PCs). Here, topography was examined using calbindin-D-28K immunohistochemistry of adult and hatchling turtles (Trachemys scripta elegans, 2.5-15 cm carapace length). Each Cb was flattened between two Sylgard sheets and fixed in paraformaldehyde. Sections (52 A mu m thick) were cut parallel to the flattened cortex (tangential), resulting in calbindin-immunolabeled PCs being localized to three to six sections for each turtle. PC position and size were quantified using Neurolucida Image Analysis system. Although hatchling Cb were medial-laterally narrower (3.0 vs. 6.5 mm) and rostral-caudally shorter (2.5 vs. 5.5 mm) than adult Cb, both averaged near 15,000 PCs distributed uniformly. Hatchling PCs were smaller than adult PCs (178 vs. 551 A mu m(2)) and more densely packed (2,180 vs. 625 cells/mm(2)). Calbindin immunoreactivity also labeled non-PCs along the Cb's marginal rim and its caudal pole. Many of these were very small (22.9 A mu m(2)) ovoid-shaped cells clustered together, possibly proliferating external granule layer cells. Other labeled cells were larger and fusiform-shaped (12.6 x 33.4 A mu m) adjacent to inner granule cells along the marginal rim, suggestive of migrating cells. It is not known whether these are new neurons being generated within the adult and hatchling Cb and if they connect to efferent and afferent paths. Based on these anatomical findings, we suggest that unique physiological features may exist along the rim of the turtle Cb.

AB  - Despite being ectotherms, reptiles have an ability to thermoregulate which is enhanced by adopting a variety of behavioural mechanisms. Different behavioural postures, the use of retreat sites and selection of microhabitats enable reptiles to maintain their core body temperatures (T-b) above that of ambient temperatures (T-a) in winter or below T-a maximum in summer. This study describes the daily activity patterns of leopard tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis) in relation to T-b and T-a, and the extent to which leopard tortoises can manipulate their T-b in response to seasonal changes in T-a. Ten and nine leopard tortoises were radio-tracked in 2002 and 2003, respectively and cloacal T-b and behaviours observed. Core T(b)s were measured using Thermocron iButtons (TM) surgically implanted into the body cavities of 4 and 5 adult telemetered tortoises for summer and winter 2003, respectively. There were seasonal differences in the extent to which certain behaviours were practiced and the time of day that these occurred. Leopard tortoises generally had unimodal activity patterns in winter and bimodal ones in summer. In winter tortoises were active at lower T(b)s, and at lower T-a, than in summer. Tortoises maintained their core T-b well below T-a minimum profiles in summer and well above these in winter. Core T-b closely followed the increase in T-a minimum profiles in the mornings, however tortoises exhibited an extended thermal lag when T-a minimum profiles cooled overnight. By using different behavioural mechanisms in summer and winter, leopard tortoises maintained their core T-b at different levels compared with T-a minimum and maximum profiles. Consequently although they are ectotherms, they maintained their core T-b independent of T-a. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective-To describe a noninvasive technique for sex identification of posthatchling chelonians and to assess its safety in Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni).
   Design-Validation study and clinical trial.
   Animals-15 recently dead posthachling chelonians and 25 healthy posthatchling Hermann's tortoises.
   Procedures-Cystoscopy was performed on both dead and anesthetized live chelonians. Dead chelonians ranged in body weight from 32.4 to 75.1 g (0.07 to 0.17 lb; median, 45.7 g 10.10 lb]). Dead chelonians were dissected immediately after cystoscopy, and gonads were collected for histologic examination. Urinary bladder was macroscopically evaluated in situ to assess its integrity after retrograde injection of saline (0.9% NaCl) solution. Hermann's tortoises ranged in body weight from 27.3 to 57.8 g (0.06 to 0.13 lb; median, 37.0 g [0.08 Cystoscopic examination of live tortoises was performed following induction of general anesthesia with a mixture of morphine, dexmedetomidine, and ketamine administered IM. The Pearson coefficient was used to assess the consistency between procedure time and body weight; kappa statistic was used to evaluate agreement between sex identified by cystoscopy and histologic examination beyond that expected by mere chance.
   Results-Visualization of gonads was feasible through the thin, transparent urinary bladder wall in all the animals evaluated in this study. Blinded histologic examination confirmed the results of cystoscopic gonad identification in all dead chelonians (kappa = 1.0). The urinary bladder did not have evidence of macroscopic leakage or microscopic alterations of normal tissue architecture within the representative sections chosen for histologic examination. In live tortoises, median procedure time (range) was 90 (39 to 345) seconds. No significant correlations were found between procedure time and body weight.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Cystoscopy performed by means of rigid endoscopy with fluid instillation was found to be an effective method for sex identification of immature chelonians. Furthermore, no complications were observed when this procedure was performed in vivo.

AB  - The occurrence of variation in body size and reproductive traits of Vipera aspis was assessed by analysing 74 reproductive females of different populations, collected throughout a large part of the distribution range of the taxon, from central-western France to central Italy. Six populations were analysed, two of plain habitats, in France and Italy, characterized by a Continental climate, whereas the other four derived from two coastal and two inland, hilly Italian habitats, respectively, showing a Mediterranean climate. Females of the French area showed the smallest mean body size, whereas the pre- and post-partum body masses of females from the coolest, central Italic area were significantly higher. Litter size varied among habitats and was significantly correlated with maternal body size. If the snout-vent length feature varied largely among offspring of different habitats (with the longest size occurring in representatives of the coastal, central Italian area), the average of both body mass and total mass of offsprings did not exhibit any clear pattern among populations colonizing different habitats. Nevertheless, relative litter mass was higher in the French continental populations, and lower in the coolest, Mediterranean, Italian ones. It is worth emphasizing the positive correlation between the snout-vent length feature of females and the total litter mass to environmental factors, such as hottest month temperature and total rainfall. The available literature records that female body size affects offspring size and fecundity. If the present study bolsters this correlation, it also rules out any other effect of female body size on the offspring characteristics analysed. Finally, evidence is provided for the role of climatic factors on life-history traits (e.g. pre-partum body mass) of asp vipers, although confounding effects pursued, for example, by food availability may occur.

AB  - Background: The tissue growth necessary to achieve a complete or partial restitution ad integrum as a result of injury to soft tissue and/or hard times in reptiles is variable and often needs long time in relation to the species, to the habitat and to their intrinsic physiological characteristics. The purpose of this work was to see if the tissue optimization (TO) treatment with radio electric asymmetric conveyer (REAC) provided good results in these animals and whether its use translates into reduced time of tissue repair. This paper describes preliminary results with in promoting the tissue repair in reptiles.
   Cases presentation: A 5 year old male Testudo graeca (Leo) and Trachemys scripta scripta (Mir) and a 15 year old female Testudo hermanni (Juta) were evaluated because of soft tissue injuries. A female 25 year old Trachemys scripta elegans (Ice), a female 2.5 year old Trachemys scripta scripta (Penelope) as well as a 50 year old male Testudo graeca (Margherito) were evaluated because of wounds of the carapace. Following debridement and traditional therapies, Leo, Penelope and Margherito were exposed to the radio electric asymmetric conveyer (REAC) device, with a specific treatment protocol, named tissue optimization-basic (TO-B). Also Ice and Mir were subjected to REAC treatment after wounds debridement. Juta was treated only with REAC treatment.
   Complete wound healing was evident after 17 days for Leo, 7 days for Penelope, 27 days for Mir, 78 days for Ice and after 14 days for Margherito. Juta showed a considerable tissue activation in 2 days and complete wound healing in 5 days.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that REAC TO-B treatment may provide advantages over other traditional methods after complete wound healing in Leo, and also suitable healing in the other patients. Then REAC device with its specific treatment TO-B protocol, which induces tissue repair without causing severe stress to the patient, could be a potential therapy for tissue damage healing in reptiles. Further studies still need to be conducted to support our observations.

AB  - BackgroundIn free-ranging reptile populations, bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic pathogens may affect hosts through impairment in movements, thermoregulation, reproduction, survival, and population dynamics. The speckled dwarf tortoise (Chersobius [Homopus] signatus) is a threatened species that is mostly restricted to the Succulent Karoo biome in South Africa, and little information on pathogens of this species is available yet. We derived baseline parameters for five males and five females that were captured to genetically enhance a conservation breeding program in Europe. Upon collection of the tortoises, ticks were removed and identified. Immediately upon arrival in Europe, ocular, nasal, oral and cloacal swabs were taken for viral, bacteriological and mycological examinations. Fecal samples were collected before and 1 month after fenbendazole treatment, and analyzed for parasites. A panel of PCR, aiming to detect herpesviruses, adenoviruses and iridoviruses, was carried out.ResultsSamples were negative for viruses, while bacteriological examination yielded detectable growth in 82.5% of the swabs with a mean load of 16x10(7)61x10(8) colony forming units (CFU) per swab, representing 34 bacterial species. Cloacal and oral swabs yielded higher detectable growth loads than nasal and ocular swabs, but no differences between sexes were observed. Fungi and yeasts (mean load 5x10(3)+/- 13x10(3) CFU/swab) were detected in 25% of the swabs. All pre-treatment fecal samples were positive for oxyurid eggs, ranging from 200 to 2400 eggs per gram of feces, whereas after the treatment a significantly reduced egg count (90-100% reduction) was found in seven out of 10 individuals. One remaining individual showed 29% reduction, and two others had increased egg counts. In five tortoises, Nycthocterus spp. and coccidian oocysts were also identified. Soft ticks were identified as Ornithodoros savignyi.Conclusions Our baseline data from clinically healthy individuals will help future studies to interpret prevalences of microorganisms in speckled dwarf tortoise populations. The study population did not appear immediately threatened by current parasite presence.

AB  - Desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) populations have experienced precipitous declines resulting from the cumulative impact of habitat loss, and human and disease-related mortality. Evaluation of hematologic and biochemical responses of desert tortoises to physiologic and environmental factors can facilitate the assessment of stress and disease in tortoises and contribute to management decisions and population recovery. The goal of this study was to obtain and analyze clinical laboratory data from free-ranging desert tortoises at three sites in the Mojave Desert (California, USA) between October 1990 and October 1995, to establish reference intervals, and to develop guidelines for the interpretation of laboratory data under a variety of environmental and physiologic conditions. Body weight, carapace length, and venous blood samples for a complete blood count and clinical chemistry profile were obtained from 98 clinically healthy adult desert tortoises of both sexes at the Desert Tortoise Research Natural area (western Mojave), Goffs (eastern Mojave) and Ivanpah Valley (northeastern Mojave). Samples were obtained four times per year, in winter (February/March), spring (May/June), summer (July/August), and fall (October). Years of near-, above- and below-average rainfall were represented in the 5 yr period. Minimum, maximum and median values, and central 95 percentiles were used as reference intervals and measures of central tendency for tortoises at each site and/or season. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance for significant (P < 0.01) variation on the basis of sex, site, season, and interactions between these variables. Significant sex differences were observed for packed cell volume, hemoglobin concentration, aspartate transaminase activity, and cholesterol, triglyceride, calcium, and phosphorus concentrations. Marked seasonal variation was observed in most parameters in conjunction with reproductive cycle, hibernation, or seasonal rainfall. Year-to-year differences and long-term alterations primarily reflected winter rainfall amounts. Site differences were minimal, and largely reflected geographic differences in precipitation patterns, such that results from these studies can be applied to other tortoise populations in environments with known rainfall and forage availability patterns.

AB  - The interior of the Iberian Peninsula has orographic conditions that make this territory especially vulnerable to Quaternary climate oscillations and which actually could have made it decisive for Paleolithic human populations at critical points. For this reason, the information provided by paleon-tological sites is important for reconstructing climatic and environmental conditions during the Late Pleistocene and understanding how they influenced the species that inhabited them, including humans. Nevertheless, the archaeo-paleontological record is scarce in central Iberia for the Late Pleistocene. A central Iberian site that is key to addressing this issue is Cueva de los Torrejones, which was discovered and excavated during the nineties. Clues indicating the presence of Neandertal populations near the cave site were announced during prior field excavations, including Neandertal remains, Middle Paleolithic artifacts, and evidence of anthropic exploitation of faunal resources at the site. Here we report the new results from the recent excavations and research, including detailed studies on stratigraphy, micro-morphology, macro and microvertebrate paleontology, physical and molecular anthropology, taphonomy and zooarchaeology, and analysis of lithic and pottery remains. Our research has led to the detection of three Prehistoric chronologies recorded at the site. The oldest episode corresponds to between MIS 5 and MIS 4 in which the cave was used by carnivores. The second episode is represented by a faunal asso-ciation dated to 30.0 ka cal BP and is indicative of cooler and more arid environmental conditions and, therefore, compatible with the worsening climate detected previously for MIS 3 in this area. The last episode corresponds to the Chalcolithic, directly dated to similar to 5000 cal BP in which humans used the cavity for funerary purposes. The DNA analysis of the human remain was assigned to mtDNA haplogroup K, which was originated in the Near East and reached western Europe through the Neolithic expansion. Human occupation during the Paleolithic has been ruled out, including Paleolithic human remains and any kind of anthropic intervention on the Hermann's tortoise and leopard as was previously proposed at the site.

AB  - The technique of counting growth rings to estimate age of turtles is widespread in the scientific literature. Review articles to date have provided primarily Lists of authors who have found the technique useful or not, but these reviews have failed to evaluate properly how well the technique actually works. In an attempt to examine how well the published literature supports a biologically meaningful relationship between age and number of growth rings, we surveyed 145 scientific papers that have used counts of rings on scutes to estimate age of individual turtles.
   Of the 145 papers surveyed, the authors of 44 papers, which comprised 49 case studies, presented data testing the use of growth ring counts for a population of turtles. Of these 49 case studies, 6 reported that die use of the technique was reliable for aging their turtle species past sexual maturity, 15 reported its use to be reliable for aging turtles to adult (i.e., sexual maturity), 8 reported its use to be reliable for aging juvenile turtles, 2 found it to be reliable with no age limit given, and 8 reported its use unreliable as a method for aging their turtles. The remainder of the case studies presented data that were difficult for us to interpret as reliable or unreliable. Although 22 papers addressed the pattern of growth ring deposition, only four case studies had sufficient data to indicate that a consistent number of rings was added each year. in this paper, we illustrate how the widespread use of this technique ultimately has led to its acceptance without the rigor of tests of its validity or accuracy. We conclude that (a) studies attempting to calibrate the relationship between growth rings and age are few, (b) a majority of the papers that we surveyed referenced other papers that did not themselves include a test justifying growth ring counts as an estimate of turtle age, (c) aging turtles from counts of growth rings might be feasible in some types of studies, for some species at some locations, but only after calibrating the relationship between ring counts and age for each circumstance, and (d) there is currently no justification for generalizing the use of growth rings to estimate turtle age for many species.

AB  - The proliferation of the epidermis in soft skin, claws, and scutes of the carapace and plastron in the tortoise (Testudo hermanni) and the turtle (Chrysemys picta) were studied using autoradiographic and immunocytochemical methods. During the growing season, a basal keratinocyte in the epidermis of soft skin and claws takes 5-9 days to migrate into the corneous layer. In the tortoise, during fall/winter (resting season) a few alphakeratin cells are produced in soft epidermis and hinge regions among scutes and occasional beta-keratin cells in the outer scute surface. When growth is resumed in spring (growing season), cell proliferation is intense, mainly around hinge regions and tips of marginal scutes. No scute shedding occurs and numerous beta-keratin cells are produced around the hinge regions, while alpha-keratin cells disappear. Beta-cells form a new thick corneous layer around the hinge regions, which constitute the growing rings of scutes. Beta-keratin cells produced in more central parts of scutes maintain a homogeneous thickness of the corneous layer along the whole scute surface. In the turtle, a more complicated process of scute growth occurs than in the tortoise. At the end of the growing season (late fall) the last keratinocytes formed beneath the old stratum corneum of the outer scale surface and hinge regions produce more alpha- than beta-keratin. These thin alphakeratin cells form a scission layer below the old stratum corneum, which extends from the hinge regions toward the center of scutes and the tip of marginal scutes. In the resting season (fall/winter) most cells remain within the germinative layer of the carapace and plastron and a few alpha-cells move in 7-9 days into the corneous layer above hinge regions. In the following spring/summer (growing season) a new generation of beta-keratin cells is produced beneath the scission layer from the hinge region and more central part of the scutes. The epidermis of the inner surface of scutes and hinge regions contains most of the cells incorporating thymidine and histidine, while the remaining outer scute surface is less active. It takes 5-9 days for a newly produced beta-cell to migrate into the corneous layer. These cells form a new corneous layer that extends the whole scute surface underneath the maturing scission layer. The latter contains lipids and eventually flakes off, determining shedding of the above outer corneous layer in late spring or summer. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Testudinid herpesvirus 3 (TeHV-3) is the causative agent of a lethal disease affecting several tortoise species. The threat that this virus poses to endangered animals is focusing efforts on characterizing its properties, in order to enable the development of prophylactic methods. We have sequenced the genomes of the two most studied TeHV-3 strains (1976 and 4295). TeHV-3 strain 1976 has a novel genome structure and is most closely related to a turtle herpesvirus, thus supporting its classification into genus Scutavirus, subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, family Herpesviridae. The sequence of strain 1976 also revealed viral counterparts of cellular interleukin-10 and semaphorin, which have not been described previously in members of subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae. TeHV-3 strain 4295 is a mixture of three forms (m1, m2, and M), in which, in comparison to strain 1976, the genomes exhibit large, partially overlapping deletions of 12.5 to 22.4 kb. Viral subclones representing these forms were isolated by limiting dilution assays, and each replicated in cell culture comparably to strain 1976. With the goal of testing the potential of the three forms as attenuated vaccine candidates, strain 4295 was inoculated intranasally into Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni). All inoculated subjects died, and PCR analyses demonstrated the ability of the m2 and M forms to spread and invade the brain. In contrast, the m1 form was detected in none of the organs tested, suggesting its potential as the basis of an attenuated vaccine candidate. Our findings represent a major step toward characterizing TeHV-3 and developing prophylactic methods against it.
   IMPORTANCE
   Testudinid herpesvirus 3 (TeHV-3) causes a lethal disease in tortoises, several species of which are endangered. We have characterized the viral genome and used this information to take steps toward developing an attenuated vaccine. We have sequenced the genomes of two strains (1976 and 4295), compared their growth in vitro, and investigated the pathogenesis of strain 4295, which consists of three deletion mutants. The major findings are that (i) TeHV-3 has a novel genome structure, (ii) its closest relative is a turtle herpesvirus, (iii) it contains interleukin-10 and semaphorin genes (the first time these have been reported in an alphaherpesvirus), (iv) a sizeable region of the genome is not required for viral replication in vitro or virulence in vivo, and (v) one of the components of strain 4295, which has a deletion of 22.4 kb, exhibits properties indicating that it may serve as the starting point for an attenuated vaccine.
