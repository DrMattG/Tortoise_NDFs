AB  - The predation of young tortoise is considered a major cause of mortality for many tortoise species. The predation by common ravens has been identified as being responsible for significant decreases in tortoise populations. Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise hatchlings and juveniles in Maamora forest (Morocco) were studied in order to describe the size/age class predation of common ravens on young tortoises and infer the drivers of predation risk and population abundance. The results showed a high level of predation on young tortoises (<75 mm carapace length) attributed to ravens in areas with low vegetation cover, representing 100% of the cases of mortality (n = 147), but it was moderate in covered areas (n = 19), representing 12–27%. The population structure of living juveniles differed significantly between covered and uncovered areas, thus suggesting that raven predation might modify juvenile population structure. Finally, N-mixture models showed a positive relationship between (i) bare cover and tortoise detectability that is only evidenced when the plot is far from a perch and (ii) population abundance and shrub species-richness, being higher in uncovered areas. Our results improve the knowledge on predation and survival on this critical stage in life, which is crucial for the conservation of the Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise.

AB  - The dissemination of vector arthropods harbouring zoonotic pathogens through the uncontrolled transboundary trade of exotic and pet animals poses an important threat to Public Health. In the present report, we describe the introduction of pathogenic Rickettsia africae and R. aeschlimanni in ticks removed from imported tortoises in Qatar. A total of 21 ticks were collected from pet spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) from Doha, May 2018, and studied for species identification and characterization of Rickettsia spp. Morphological and molecular analysis of ticks allowed their identification as Hyalomma aegyptium. Molecular analysis of partial ompA and gltA genes showed that Rickettsia sequences found on these ticks clustered with sequences classified as R. aeschilimanii and R. africae. Since pre-adult stages of H. aegyptium also feed on humans, this tick species may play a role in the transmission of R. aeschilimanii and R. africae. We alert for the introduction of non-native pets as vehicles for tick importation, known vectors for animal and human pathogenic agents. Importation of exotic species into non-autochthonous countries deserves strict control to enforce robust surveillance and mitigate potential exotic diseases epidemics.

AB  - The spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) is an endangered Mediterranean tortoise that lives in North Africa, Southern Europe and Southwest Asia. In the wake of recent legislation making their keeping as domestic animals illegal, many of these animals have been returned to wildlife recovery centers in Spain. In the present study, a population of such tortoises showing signs of ocular disease and nasal discharge was examined for the presence of Chlamydia spp. Cloacal, conjunctival and/or choanal swabs were collected from 58 animals. Using a real-time PCR specific for the family Chlamydiaceae, 57/58 animals tested positive in at least one sample. While only a few samples proved positive for C. pecorum, sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed a sequence identical to previously published sequences from specimens of German and Polish tortoises. Whole-genome sequences obtained from two conjunctival swab samples, as well as ANIb, TETRA values and a scheme based on 9 taxonomic marker genes revealed that the strain present in the Spanish tortoises represented a new yet non-classified species, with C. pecorum being its closest relative. We propose to designate the new species Candidatus Chlamydia testudinis.

AB  - In the transition between Mediterranean forest and the arid subtropical shrublands of the southeastern Iberian Peninsula, humans have transformed habitat since ancient times. Understanding the role of the original mosaic landscapes in wildlife species and the effects of the current changes as pine forest plantations, performed even outside the forest ecological boundaries, are important conservation issues. We studied variation in the density of the endangered spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) in three areas that include the four most common land types within the species' range (pine forests, natural shrubs, dryland crop fields, and abandoned crop fields). Tortoise densities were estimated using a two-stage modeling approach with line transect distance sampling. Densities in dryland crop fields, abandoned crop fields and natural shrubs were higher (>6 individuals/ha) than in pine forests (1.25 individuals/ha). We also found large variation in density in the pine forests. Recent pine plantations showed higher densities than mature pine forests where shrub and herbaceous cover was taller and thicker. We hypothesize that mature pine forest might constrain tortoise activity by acting as partial barriers to movements. This issue is relevant for management purposes given that large areas in the tortoise's range have recently been converted to pine plantations.

AB  - Morphometric analyses were carried out on Testudo graeca from west-central Morocco, and compared to previously published mitochondrial DNA sequence variation. We measured 41 characters on 244 tortoises from three localities, including one population of T. g. soussensis from Souss Valley. All three populations could be statistically differentiated in a multivariate space using these characters. The population from the Jbilet mountains was the most differentiated (no overlap), those from Essaouira on the coast and from Admine showed limited overlap (5%). Sexual size dimorphism (males < females) remained constant between sites. Sexual shape dimorphism was prominent in all populations, but the degree of dimorphism differed for some characters when corrected for size. Tortoises from Jbilet living under harsher conditions (low precipitation, high thermal amplitude, low plant cover) were smaller, lighter, more flattened and less dimorphic in shape than the others. Although the Admine population (currently assigned to T. g. soussensis) was morphologically distinct, its distinctiveness was less supported than in the case of Jbilet; several other qualitative traits previously considered as defining this subspecies were also questionable. Moreover, this morphological variation contrasted with the available genetic evidence (12S rRNA mtDNA) which did not reveal significant variation between any of the populations. This implies that morphological differences have either arisen very recently or can be attributed to phenotypic plasticity. This should be taken into account when using morphological traits for taxonomic considerations and conservation management.

AB  - This paper reviews recent developments in geochronology, archaeology, and behavioral interpretations of the Middle Paleolithic Period (ca. 47–250 Kyr) in the East Mediterranean Levant. Neandertals and early modern humans both occupied the Levant during this period. Both these hominids are associated with the Levantine Mousterian stone tool industry and similar sets of faunal remains. The Levant has long been seen as preserving evidence for the origin of modern humans out of Neandertal ancestors. Recent radiometric dates for Levantine Middle Paleolithic contexts challenge this hypothesis. Instead, they suggest the evolutionary relationships between these hominids were far more complicated. Proposed models for Neandertal and early modern human coevolutionary relationships are examined. Intense competition between Neandertals and early modern humans for a narrow human “niche” may be the context out of which the Upper Paleolithic behavioral “revolution” arose.

AB  - During the fall of 1995 and the spring of 1996, 77 statistically comparable tick collections, comprising 792 specimens, were made from adults of the Russian spur-thighed tortoise, Testudo graeca nikolskii, at 4 sites along Russia's Black Sea coast. These are the first tick collections reported from T. g. nikolskii since its recognition as a taxonomic entity. All ticks were determined to be Hyalomma (Hyalomma) aegyptium, a common tortoise parasite in southern Russia that in 1930 was erroneously designated the type of subgenus Hyalommasta. Male ticks were recovered from more tortoises (67) than were females (57) or immatures (14), and nymphs were seen only in the fall. Significantly more ticks parasitized male tortoises than females, perhaps because males of T. g. nikolskii have larger home ranges. However, no functional relationship was found between tortoise ventral surface area and degree of tick infestation. Like other tortoise ticks, H. aegyptium is expected to decline in concert with its increasingly threatened hosts.

AB  - Testudo graeca is an endangered species of tortoise that inhabits Mediterranean areas of Africa, Asia, and Europe. Western populations are found on both sides of the Straits of Gibraltar. The effects of geographical isolation on genetic divergence were assessed by the sequence analysis of two mitochondrial DNA regions of the 12S rRNA and cytochrome b genes. Four different haplotypes were identified. A single haplotype was shared by all Spanish and some east Moroccan specimens. Two haplotypes were unique to the west Moroccan T. graeca populations and allowed the clear discrimination between individual specimens found west of the Moulouya River. Phylogenetic analysis based on the estimation of nucleotide sequence distances of the haplotypes suggests an African origin for the Spanish populations and a subspecies status for the west Moroccan pool.

AB  - Salmonella spp. are frequently shed by wildlife including turtles, but S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium or lesions associated with Salmonella are rare in turtles. Between 1996 and 2016, we necropsied 127 apparently healthy pelagic olive ridley turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) that died from drowning bycatch in fisheries and 44 live or freshly dead stranded turtles from the west coast of North and Central America and Hawaii. Seven percent (9/127) of pelagic and 47% (21/44) of stranded turtles had renal granulomas associated with S. Typhimurium. Stranded animals were 12 times more likely than pelagic animals to have Salmonella-induced nephritis suggesting that Salmonella may have been a contributing cause of stranding. S. Typhimurium was the only Salmonella serovar detected in L. olivacea, and phylogenetic analysis from whole genome sequencing showed that the isolates from L. olivacea formed a single clade distinct from other S. Typhimurium. Molecular clock analysis revealed that this novel clade may have originated as recently as a few decades ago. The phylogenetic lineage leading to this group is enriched for non-synonymous changes within the genomic area of Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 suggesting that these genes are important for host adaptation.

AB  - Animal movement and behavior may respond to habitat modification or fragmentation in non trivial ways, thereby strongly conditioning the fate of populations. This study aims to understand movement patterns of non-dispersal animals in both natural and altered landscapes, using the endangered terrestrial tortoise Testudo graeca as example. We used individual-based simulation models representing competing hypotheses on tortoise movement. Model parameterization and selection was based on radiotracking data and an inverse approach that is able to deal with observation uncertainty, individual variability, and process stochasticity. We find that land use intensification had a strong impact on the movement and behavior of non-dispersing individuals of T. graeca. In natural landscapes, males and females showed a similar movement and behavior profile with a strong home behavior component, and little individual variability. However, in altered landscapes, movement and behavior greatly varied among individuals, parti...

AB  - Background: Blood parasites of the genus Karyolysus Labbe, 1894 (Apicomplexa: Adeleida: Karyolysidae) represent the protozoan haemogregarines found in various genera of lizards, including Lacerta, Podarcis, Darevskia (Lacertidae) and Mabouia (Scincidae). The vectors of parasites are gamasid mites from the genus Ophionyssus. Methods: A total of 557 individuals of lacertid lizards were captured in four different localities in Europe (Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia) and blood was collected. Samples were examined using both microscopic and molecular methods, and phylogenetic relationships of all isolates of Karyolysus sp. were assessed for the first time. Karyolysus sp. 18S rRNA isolates were evaluated using Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood analyses. Results: A total of 520 blood smears were examined microscopically and unicellular protozoan parasites were found in 116 samples (22.3% prevalence). The presence of two Karyolysus species, K. latus and K. lacazei was identified. In total, of 210 samples tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the presence of parasites was observed in 64 individuals (prevalence 30.5%). Results of phylogenetic analyses revealed the existence of four haplotypes, all part of the same lineage, with other parasites identified as belonging to the genus Hepatozoon. Conclusions: Classification of these parasites using current taxonomy is complex - they were identified in both mites and ticks that typically are considered to host Karyolysus and Hepatozoon respectively. Furthermore although distortions to the intermediate host erythrocyte nuclei were observed, the defining characteristic of Karyolysus, the haplotypes were nearly identical to those reported from lizards in the Iberian Peninsula, where such distortions were not reported and which were thus identified as Hepatozoon. Based on the phylogenetic analyses, neither vertebrate host, nor geographical patterns of the studied blood parasites could be established.

AB  - In the last decade, Asian populations of Testudo graeca were split into as many as 10 species based on morphology and morphometry and then subsequently synonymized based on genetic evidence. We generate new morphometric data for six of these disputed species from Turkey, a major center of morphological and genetic diversity for Asian T. graeca . We test the concordance of our data with previous morphological assignments. Our morphometric data and analyses do not support all of the results of previous morphometric studies. Instead we find that putatively named taxa from the Mediterranean coast (“ antakyensis ”, “ anamurensis ”, and “ terrestris ”) are not morphometrically distinct. On the other hand, some inland populations from eastern Turkey (“ armeniaca ” and “ perses ”) are morphometrically distinct as previously claimed. Tortoise populations from northern and southern Turkey, which may correspond to the ibera and terrestris mt clades, also appear to be morphometrically distinct. In this respect, the morphometric data reflects the emerging genetic pattern, although the picture is complicated by a lack of genetic sampling within Turkey and morphometric studies outside of Turkey.

Hemolivia mauritanica-like gametocytes were found in 81% (n = 47) of wild Testudo marginata Schoepff, 1792 tortoises in Greece. Parasitaemia intensity (the percentage of infected red blood cells found in approximately 104 cells) was 0.03-22.4% in T. graeca and 0.06-12.27% in T. marginata. On the other hand, all blood samples from 40 Bulgarian, 38 Greek, and 18 Croatian specimens of Testudo hermanni Gmelin, 1789 were negative.

AB  - An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for the detection of antibodies to a herpesvirus associated with an upper respiratory tract disease in Mediterranean tortoises [spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) and Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni)]. This serodiagnostic test was validated through a hyperimmunization study. The mean of the A(405) readings of the plasma samples collected at time zero of the hyperimmunization study plus three times the standard deviation was used as the cutoff for seropositivity in tortoises. ELISA results were compared to serum neutralization (SN) values for the same samples by using the McNemar test. The results obtained by SN and ELISA were not significantly different (P > 0.05). This new ELISA could be used as an important diagnostic tool for screening wild populations and private and zoo collections of Mediterranean tortoises.

AB  - To help conservation programs of the endangered spur-thighed tortoise and to gain better insight into its systematics, genetic variation and evolution in the tortoise species Testudo graeca (Testudines: Testudinidae) was investigated by sequence analysis of a 394-nucleotide fragment of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene for 158 tortoise specimens belonging to the subspecies Testudo graeca graeca, Testudo graeca ibera, Testudo graeca terrestris, and a newly recognized subspecies Testudo graeca whitei. A 411-nucleotide fragment of the mitochondrial D-loop was additionally sequenced for a subset of 22 T. graeca, chosen because of their 12S gene haplotype and/or geographical origin. Haplotype networks generated by maximum-likelihood and neighbor-joining analyses of both the separate and the combined sequence data sets suggested the existence of two main clades of Testudo graeca, comprising Testudo graeca from northern Africa and Testudo graeca from the Turkey and the Middle East, respectively. Mitochondrial DNA haplotyping suggests that the tortoise subspecies of T. g. graeca and T. g. ibera are genetically distinct, with a calculated divergence time in the early or middle Pleistocene. Other proposed subspecies could not clearly be recognized based upon their mt haplotypes and phylogenetic position, and were either part of the T. g. graeca or of the T. g. ibera clade, suggesting that genetic evidence for the existence of most of the 15 proposed subspecies of T. graeca is weak.

AB  - Demographic analyses suggest that chelonians will have a low ability to withstand harvesting, although most have been based on stationary or declining populations. In contrast to this prediction, a population of Testudo graeca grew at the instantaneous rate r = 0.137 from 1980–1990, with a doubling time of 5 years. r was similar in both adult and 10 cm animals, showing that this high rate was not due to changes in population structure, and may thus be taken as an intrinsic rate of increase (rm). rm was higher than that of most large mammals, and suggests that sustainable harvesting would be a viable conservation strategy for chelonians if tightly regulated. Ranching or farming operations for chelonians would be even more likely to succeed, given their high fecundity. A resumption of trade in Mediterranean tortoises is, however, unlikely to be economically sustainable.

AB  - RESEARCHES ON THE DIAMETER OF THE SUN.—Herr Auwers has published in the Sitzungsberichte der Königlich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin, 1886, No. 1., the first part of an elaborate investigation of the value of the sun's diameter as found from meridian observations, and of the apparent variations thereof. The discussion now published refers to variations in the mean annual values only of the diameter. The series of observations discussed are the meridian observations of the sun made at Greenwich, 1851-83; at Washington, 1866-82; at Oxford (Radcliffe Observatory), 1862-83 5 and at Neuchâtel (transit observations only), 1862-83. The “personal equations” of the various observers are first determined on the supposition that there may be periodic annual variations, both in the horizontal and vertical diameters of the sun, such for instance as have been supposed by Secchi and others to exist, with a period corresponding to the sunspot cycle. The first determination of “personal equation” is therefore made by comparing observations taken in each year with others taken in the same year only. The resulting diameters are, however, such as to convince Herr Auwers that, although inequalities exist in each of the series of observations discussed, their comparison with each other and with the sunspot curve is sufficient to show that they have no connexion either with the latter or with a progressive change, but are most probably due to uncorrected “personal equations.” A second determination of these on the assumption that, for some observers at least, they are liable to change, but that the sun's diameter is not subject to annual variation, leads to much more satisfactory results, and is regarded by Herr Auwers as the correct solution of the problem. The effect of personality on the deduced solar diameter, which on the average, for an individual observer, amounts to about 1″(sometimes 3″, 4″, and even 10″), may be inferred from the fact that the values of the horizontal and vertical diameters of the sun, deduced from thirty-three years' observation with the Greenwich transit-circle, and referred to the mean of Dunkin, Ellis, Criswick, and J. Carpenter, as standard, are respectively 32′ 2″.48 and 32′ 2″.00; whilst, referred to the mean of fifty-four observers, the same observations give, for the horizontal and vertical diameters respectively, the values 32′ 1″.99 and 32′ 2″.73.

AB  - This review considers whether the vestibular system includes separate populations of sensory axons innervating individual organs and giving rise to distinct central pathways. There is a variability in the discharge properties of afferents supplying each organ. Discharge regularity provides a marker for this diversity since fibers which differ in this way also differ in many other properties. Postspike recovery of excitability determines the discharge regularity of an afferent and its sensitivity to depolarizing inputs. Sensitivity is small in regularly discharging afferents and large in irregularly discharging afferents. The enhanced sensitivity of irregular fibers explains their larger responses to sensory inputs, to efferent activation, and to externally applied galvanic currents, but not their distinctive response dynamics. Morphophysiological studies show that regular and irregular afferents innervate overlapping regions of the vestibular nuclei. Intracellular recordings of EPSPs reveal that some secondary vestibular neurons receive a restricted input from regular or irregular afferents, but that most such neurons receive a mixed input from both kinds of afferents. Anodal currents delivered to the labyrinth can result in a selective and reversible silencing of irregular afferents. Such a functional ablation can provide estimates of the relative contributions of regular and irregular inputs to a central neuron’s discharge. From such estimates it is concluded that secondary neurons need not resemble their afferent inputs in discharge regularity or response dynamics. Several suggestions are made as to the potentially distinctive contributions made by regular and irregular afferents: (1) Reflecting their response dynamics, regular and irregular afferents could compensate for differences in the dynamic loads of various reflexes or of individual reflexes in different parts of their frequency range; (2) The gating of irregular inputs to secondary VOR neurons could modify the operation of reflexes under varying behavioral circumstances; (3) Two-dimensional sensitivity can arise from the convergence onto secondary neurons of otolith inputs differing in their directional properties and response dynamics; (4) Calyx afferents have relatively low gains when compared with irregular dimorphic afferents. This could serve to expand the stimulus range over which the response of calyx afferents remains linear, while at the same time preserving the other features peculiar to irregular afferents. Among those features are phasic response dynamics and large responses to efferent activation; (5) Because of the convergence of several afferents onto each secondary neuron, information transmission to the latter depends on the gain of individual afferents, but not on their discharge regularity.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the relationships between total calcium and phosphorus and ionised calcium and phosphorus values in clinically healthy tortoises.



Methods: Jugular blood samples were obtained from 25 tortoises, as part of a health screen of the population. These comprised Hermann’s tortoises, Testudo hermanni boettgeri, spur-thighed tortoises, Testudo graeca ibera, marginated tortoises, Testudo marginata, and horsfield tortoises, Testudo horsfieldi. Plasma from these samples were analysed for total calcium, ionised calcium and phosphorus levels. These samples were taken in the immediate posthibernation period, before the onset of reproductive activity.



Results: Females exhibited statistically significantly higher levels of phosphorus. Ionised calcium and total calcium levels were elevated in females compared with males, but this was not statistically significant. Females did have statistically significantly higher calculated solubility indexes and statistically significantly lower ratios compared with males.



Clinical Significance: This study has provided an insight into the ratios and solubility indexes in tortoises, and this information may lead to further understanding of the significance of these parameters in chelonians.

AB  - The endangered Moorish tortoise Testudo graeca is the unique terrestrial chelonian species in North-west Africa. In west-central Morocco, the endemic subspecies, the Souss valley tortoise T. g. soussensis, occupies semi-arid to arid low-quality habitats, and is subject to serious threats. A long-term mark-recapture programme from 2001 to 2012 allowed estimating population size and structure, sex ratio, and survivorship in one of the well-known populations in a degraded and overgrazed arid steppe-land of west-central Morocco. Spring population size considerably decreased to more than half in less than 10 years, with a mean density lower than 3 ind.ha-1 in 2012 compared to its last known density estimat-ed in 2003. In spring 2012, the population structure exhibited an unbalanced male-biased sex ratio (61:39) and a scarcity of juveniles (<5%). We identified five major conservation problems in the study area: (i) habitat destruction and overgrazing; (ii) over-collecting of tortoises for pet trade , iii) direct dis-turbance; iv) tortoise handling mostly for field research, and v) increased extinction risk due to the small population size. We carried out a population viability analysis using the VORTEX software based on published and obtained data on population and life history parameters. With no management action, the population will go extinct during the forthcoming 40 years after the last estimate. The most efficient management option for a long-term persistence of the population would be reducing the nest and neo-nate mortality by 90%. To attenuate the impact of the threatening factors, we developed a management plan that includes population reinforcement and habitat restoration options.

AB  - The Moroccan distribution of Testudo graeca graeca L. is defined by locality records (109) and related to data from nearby or bioclimatically equivalent meteorological stations (86) to produce a rain-temperature climagram. Tortoises attain 1900 m in the High Atlas range. Tortoises occur where mean annual rainfall (P) is up to 1062 mm, and even 1112 mm where mean minimum monthly temperature for the coolest month (m) is below 0oC and they are usually absent unless associated (90.0%) with Quercus ilex L. and Quercus suber L. woodland. Tortoises are absent from the Arctic-Alpine and Arid or Saharan bioclimates and where, without riverine habitat, Emberger's Quotient (Q) is below 19.5 (P= 139 mm) in the Steppe bioclimate. Below Q_= 39.1, they occur (88.9%) where there is Argania spinosa (L.) Maire woodland in the south-west and other broad-leaved and mixed wood- and scrubland species elsewhere. The Moroccan climagram includes and is extended by further stations (36) in the North African and southern European ranges generally (T. g. graeca is reported in NW Egypt). The Moroccan range potentially occupies 167 000 m2. Of a total of 45 stations below 550 m in NW Europe, the Western Mediterranean climagram only overlaps 12 in more oceanic Britain and Ireland; 11 are coastal or insular and 11 where Quercus woodland extends the natural range with m below 0oC in montane areas. Tortoises do not occur where mean annual sunshine much exceeds 3250 h in northern Africa or below c. 2400 h in NW Europe. Tortoises introduced from the Mediterranean region by the pet trade are unable to reproduce if they survive in NW Europe for insolation is insufficient for egg incubation and hatchling survival.

AB  - Reptiles are traded globally for medicinal purposes. Historic qualitative accounts of reptiles used as medicine in Morocco are numerous, but contemporary quantitative data are rare. In 2013-2014, we surveyed 49 wildlife markets in 20 towns throughout Morocco, plus the Spanish exclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. We recorded 1,586 specimens of at least nine species for sale in 14 of the Moroccan markets with a combined value of about US $100,000. The most prominent markets were those in Marrakesh, Meknes, Casablanca, and Fez, with the former two cites trading equal quantities of dried and live specimens and the latter two trading mainly dried specimens. Common species were the Mediterranean chameleon (Chamaeleo chamaeleon) with 720 specimens (506 dried, 214 alive) and the Bell’s Dabb lizard (Uromastyx acanthinura) with 428 specimens (247 dried, 181 alive), both traded in 10 markets, and spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca; 57 carapaces), for sale in eight cities. Over 200 African rock python (Python sebae) skins were identified and may have been illicitly imported from other parts of Africa. The turnover of Mediterranean chameleon and Bell’s Dabb lizard specimens after four weeks as measured by repeat surveys was 66% for both species, resulting in an estimated annual turnover of 1,520 chameleons (range 921–2,303) and 775 lizards (range 364–1,174). Despite legal protection and regulations locally within Morocco and internationally through CITES, reptiles are commonly and openly traded for medicinal purposes throughout Morocco. However, traders are not forthcoming in conveying the legal status of these species and restrictions on trade to potential buyers. Increased enforcement of existing wildlife protection legislation is needed to prevent this exploitation from the illegal wildlife trade that could negatively impacts imperiled species.

AB  - We study the activity patterns of a population of the spur-thighed tortoises Testudo graeca occurring in an enclosed area of 30 ha in the National Park of El Kala (northeastern Algeria) with the aim of exploring the variation in daily and seasonal activity of males, females and juveniles from March, 2004 to March, 2005. Our results show that the species displays a unimodal daily activity pattern during spring, with the highest activity during the mornings (81.55 % of active tortoise are seen between 10:00 h and 14:00 h).In summer the daily activity pattern of tortoises is lower and shows a bimodal distribution (22.22 % of active tortoises are seen early in morning between 09:00 h and 10:00 h and 41.67 % are seen later between 16:00h and 18:00 h). No differences were found between the daily activity of males and females. The monitoring of the activity during 7 months revealed that tortoises are most active in March with 2.44 tortoises/hour of search. Later, the activity decreases with 0.97 tortoises/hour of search in June. It becomes very low from July to September (from 0.25 to 0.15 tortoises/hour of search). The annual activity pattern does not vary according to age and sex.

AB  - We investigated egg characteristics of natural Testudo graeca population in Nevsehir, Cappadocia in the Central Anatolia during 2013-2015 years. We selected a valley with 42 ha as the study area because of containing the convenient tortoise habitats. We observed tortoises in opportunistic encounters by walking through the habitat in line transects between March and November in study years. Nests were determined incidentally while females were laying eggs between May and July. We removed eggs from the nest carefully on condition putting back in the same place. The length and width of each egg were measured by a digital caliper and the mass of each egg was measured by an electronic balance. SCL (The Straight Carapace Length) and mass of egg-laying females were qualified, too. We calculated egg volume (cm 3 ), relative egg mass (REM), relative clutch mass (RCM), relative egg width (REW), relative egg length (REL) and egg shape index. The clutch size was 2.33±0.49 (range 1-8) with elliptical, spherical or oval albescent eggs. The mean egg shape index and volume were 1.13±0.02 and 18.46±0.78 cm 3 , respectively. Mean female SCL and mass were 207.48 mm (range: 187.03-240.10 mm) and 1863.10 g (range: 1340-2601 g), respectively. The mean REM, RCM, REL, and REW were calculated as 1.04±0.05%, 2.42±0.74%, 17.24±1.76% and 15.18±0.84% respectively. There was a highly statistically significant positive correlation between female size, and egg width, egg volume, and egg mass. There was a highly statistically significant negative correlation between female size and clutch size. There was a highly statistically significant positive correlation between egg mass, and egg width and egg volume (p<0,001). The data described here extend our knowledge about egg characteristics and activity pattern of natural Testudo graeca population in a new area including convenient habitat for tortoises.

AB  - Aim
Recent biogeographical studies have postulated a North African, Late Pleistocene, origin for some species of the Iberian Peninsula. However, a robust assessment of such range expansions requires high-resolution molecular tools to resolve overlapping biogeographical and cultural processes. Here we aim to determine whether the spur-thighed tortoise, Testudo graeca, arrived in south-eastern Spain during historical or prehistoric times, and whether its dispersal to the Iberian Peninsula was human-mediated.

Location
The western Mediterranean Basin (south-eastern Spain, northern Algeria and north-western Morocco).

Methods
Using 428 samples from 19 sites in North Africa and 18 in south-eastern Spain, we obtained mitochondrial sequences from the cytochrome b gene and genotypes derived from seven microsatellite loci. These data were employed to obtain population genetics descriptors, haplotype networks, Bayesian cluster analyses and isolation-by-distance patterns. Moreover, we used a Bayesian demographic approach to delimit the dates involved in the range expansion.

Results
We found lower levels of genetic variability and weak mitochondrial differentiation in the south-eastern Spanish tortoises compared with the North African ones. However, exclusive haplotypes occurred in the Iberian samples and microsatellite cluster analyses revealed moderate levels of admixture across both sides of the Mediterranean. A coastal area in the west of Algeria and the central-southern region in south-eastern Spain are suggested as the most probable founder and arrival places, respectively. Finally, we identified signatures of an ancient bottleneck event approximately 20,000–30,000 years ago.

Main conclusions
The spur-thighed tortoise probably arrived in south-eastern Spain during Late Pleistocene sea-level low stands. The role that humans may have played as dispersers across the Mediterranean remains unclear. Our results are in accordance with other recent findings of trans-Mediterranean expansions during this period and highlight the importance of employing precise methodological approaches before a species can be considered as historically introduced.

AB  - Abstract Hyalomma aegyptium ticks were collected from tortoises, Testudo graeca, at localities in northern Africa, the Balkans, and the Near and Middle East. The intensity of infestation ranged from 1–37 ticks per tortoise. The sex ratio of feeding ticks was male-biased in all tested populations. Larger tortoises carried more ticks than did the smaller tortoises. The juveniles were either not infested, or carried only a poor tick load. Hyalomma aegyptium was absent in the western Souss Valley and Ourika Valley in Morocco, the Cyrenaica Peninsula in Libya, Jordan, and the Antilebanon Mountains in Syria. Hemolivia mauritanica, a heteroxenous apicomplexan cycling between T. graeca and H. aegyptium, was confirmed in Algeria, Romania, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Iran. Its prevalence ranged from 84% in Romania (n = 45), 82% in eastern Turkey (n = 28), and 82% in the area of northwestern Syria with adjacent Turkish borderland (n = 90), to 38% in Lebanon (n = 8) and in only 1 of 16 sampled tortoises in Algeria.

AB  - Long-lived species are particularly interesting for investigation of trade-offs that shape reproductive allocation and the effective contribution to the next generations. Life history theory predicts that these species will buffer environmental stochasticity via changes in the reproductive investment, while maintaining high adult survival rates. The spur-thighed tortoise was selected as a case study in order to investigate the relationship between the linked maternal characteristics (size and age) and related traits in their hatchlings. We tracked naturally emerging hatchlings from young and old females under semi-natural conditions to test variations in hatchling numbers, body mass, size and survival over two years. We used linear mixed-effect models to analyze variations in hatchling body mass and size, and a mark-release-recapture framework to model their survival. Our study illustrates that old females of long-lived species have greater offspring numbers, greater survival and smaller size when compared with those of young females. The interannual variability evidenced the reduced offspring number and survival in the lower autumn rainfall and spring mean temperature year. Our results highlight the role of maternal age and climatic conditions in the population dynamics and the need for long-term studies of reproduction traits for designating adequate conservation strategies.

AB  - Wild populations of Testudo graeca may face extinction due to large demand in the pet trade and habitat loss. Establishment of reproduction farms could alleviate the danger from collection of wild tortoises; management of such farms requires nutritional guidance. Our initial trials resulted in tortoises with soft shell syndrome and gout, due to improper nutrition. These problems were solved by using a high energy, amino acid-balanced diet for hatchlings and young tortoises. This diet also increased growth compared to wild tortoises. We determined changes in body composition with size in order to be able to formulate specific diets according to the nutritional needs of each stage of growth. Water content was about 70% in newly hatched tortoises, increased slightly till they doubled their mass, and thereafter declined gradually, stabilizing at about 60% at a body mass of 170 g. Ash content was 5% at hatching, increased gradually to 15% at 170 g, and remained stable thereafter. Lipid content was about 7% at hatching, due to the residual yolk, declined to a minimum of 2.8% at 94 g, and resumed the level of 7% from 170 g. Sulfur-amino acid levels (methionine and cysteine) were lower than those found in homeotherms; a negative correlation between sulfur and protein contents suggested a substantial sulfur compartment outside of amino acids.

AB  - Tick-borne agents constitute a growing concern for human and animal health worldwide. Hyalomma aegyptium is a hard tick with a three-host life cycle, whose main hosts for adults are Palearctic tortoises of genus Testudo. Nevertheless, immature ticks can feed on a variety of hosts, representing an important eco-epidemiological issue regarding H. aegyptium pathogens circulation. Hyalomma aegyptium ticks are vectors and/or reservoirs of various pathogenic agents, such as Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Babesia and Hepatozoon/Hemolivia. Ehrlichia and Anaplasma are emergent tick-borne bacteria with a worldwide distribution and zoonotic potential, responsible for diseases that cause clinical manifestations that grade from acute febrile illness to a fulminant disease characterized by multi-organ system failure, depending on the species. Babesia and Hepatozoon/Hemolivia are tick-borne parasites with increasing importance in multiple species. Testudo graeca tortoises acquired in a large animal market in Doha, Qatar, were screened for a panel of tick-borne pathogens by conventional PCR followed by bidirectional sequencing. The most prevalent agent identified in ticks was Hemolivia mauritanica (28.6%), followed by Candidatus Midichloria mitochondrii (9.5%) and Ehrlichia spp. (4.7%). All samples were negative for Babesia spp. and Hepatozoon spp. Overall, 43% of the examined adult ticks were infected with at least one agent. Only 4.7% of the ticks appeared to be simultaneously infected with two agents, i.e., Ehrlichia spp. and H. mauritanica. This is the first detection of H. mauritanica, Ehrlichia spp. and Candidatus M. mitochondrii in H. aegyptium ticks collected from pet spur-thighed tortoises, in Qatar, a fact which adds to the geographical extension of these agents. The international trade of Testudo tortoises carrying ticks infected with pathogens of veterinary and medical importance deserves strict control, in order to reduce potential exotic diseases.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
<jats:p>Collection for the pet trade has been considered one of the major threats to the Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise <jats:italic>Testudo graeca</jats:italic>, since it modulates the size and structure of the species’ populations and, therefore, their demography. Maamora forest is one of the most suitable habitats for this species. The proximity of the forest to Rabat indicated the possibility of these tortoise populations being particularly sensitive to over-collecting. Population demography was studied in four populations, in protected and unprotected areas in Maamora forest. The results showed significant differences as regards population size and structure between protected and unprotected areas. They specifically highlighted: i) higher density (23-17 indiv · ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) balanced populations in the protected areas, in which young adults were predominant, ii) a higher body condition in the protected areas, especially the females, and iii) a low density (5.5 ind · ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) more unbalance population in the unprotected areas, in which older females and younger males were predominant. In addition, a survey carried out by interviewing local adults (<jats:inline-formula />) showed that most people owned tortoises (61%, <jats:inline-formula />), mainly juveniles (65%, <jats:inline-formula />). The respondents stated that their tortoises had been captured in the forest (68%, <jats:inline-formula />). Maamora forest is home to one of the highest density populations of Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoises documented to date, and its conservation is essential if this species is to be maintained. Our social survey suggested that one of the challenges is to change the social perception of the Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise as a pet and highlight its intrinsic ecological value.</jats:p>

AB  - Hyalomma aegyptium is a hard-tick with a typical three-host life cycle. The main hosts are Palearctic tortoises of genus Testudo. However, other hosts can be used by immature ticks for feeding in natural conditions. Given this complex ecology and multiple host use, the circulation of pathogens by H. aegyptium between various hosts can be important from epidemiological point of view. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of H. aegyptium as natural carrier of four important zoonotic pathogens. From 2008 to 2011, 448 H. aegyptium ticks were collected from 45 Spur-thighed tortoises, Testudo graeca in Romania. DNA was extracted individually from each tick using a commercial kit. DNA was examined for the presence of specific sequences of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia canis and Coxiella burnetii by PCR, according to previously described protocols. PCR analysis of H. aegyptium revealed the presence of A. phagocytophilum (18.8%), E. canis (14.1%) and C. burnetii (10%). 32.4% of the ticks were infected with at least one pathogen and 9.8% had co-infections. The stages most frequently infected were nymphs (50%) followed by males (33.9%) and females (27%). The number of tortoises which harboured infected ticks was 27/45 examined (60%). From all tested T. graeca, 40% harboured ticks infected with A. phagocytophilum, 46.7% had ticks infected with E. canis and 33.3% had ticks with C. burnetii. This study reports for the first time the presence of A. phagocytophilum and E. canis in H. aegyptium. The presence and relatively high prevalence of three important zoonotic pathogens in H. aegyptium raises the question of their epidemiologic importance in disease ecology. As tortoises are unlikely to be reservoir hosts for A. phagocytophilum and E. canis and both these pathogens are common in H. aegyptium, this is an important indication for (1) a possible increased host-switching behaviour of these ticks to competent reservoir hosts (i.e. hedgehogs) and (2) transstadial transmission. Furthermore, if we consider also the presence of C. burnetii, we conclude that T. graeca and its ticks should be evaluated more seriously when assessing the eco-epidemiology of zoonotic diseases.

AB  - Animal populations have developed multiple strategies to deal with environmental change. Among them, the demographic buffering strategy consists in constraining the temporal variation of the vital rate(s) that most affect(s) the overall performance of the population. Tortoises are known to buffer their temporal variation in adult survival, which typically has the highest contribution to the population growth rate λ, at the expense of a high variability on reproductive rates, which contribute far less to λ. To identify the effects of projected increases in droughts in its natural habitat, we use field data collected across 15 locations of Testudo graeca in southeast Spain over a decade. We analyse the effects of environmental variables on reproduction rates. In addition, we couple the demographic and environmental data to parameterise an integral projection model to simulate the effects of different scenarios of drought recurrence on λ under different degrees of intensity in the survival–reproduction tradeoff. We find that droughts negatively affect the probability of laying eggs; however, the overall effects on λ under the current drought recurrence (one/decade) are negligible when survival is constant (independent of the reduction of reproduction by drought events) and when survival increased as a tradeoff with the reduction of reproduction rates, with a threshold to population viability at three or more droughts/decade. Additionally, we show that, although some species may buffer current environmental regimes by carefully orchestrating how their vital rates vary through time, a demographic buffering strategy is insufficient to ensure population viability in extreme regimes. Our findings support the hypothesis that the demographic buffering strategy has a limit of effectiveness when adverse conditions occur frequently. Our methodological approach provides a framework for ecologists to determine how effective the management of environmental drivers can be for demographically buffering populations, and which scenarios may not provide long-term population persistence.

AB  - The polymerase chain reaction with arbitrary primers (RAPD-PCR) was used to study intraspecific variation in Mediterranean turtle Testudo graeca, which is represented by the Dagestan (T. g. pallasi) and Nikolskii (T. g. nikolskii) subspecies in Russia. To study the phylogenetic relationships, the RAPD variation was also compared in two other T. graeca subspecies (T. g. ibera and T. g. terrestris), two closely related Testudo species (T. kleinmanni and T. marginata), and Central Asian turtle Agrionemys horsfieldii. Parameters of RAPD variation showed that the sample from different geographical regions of Dagestan was more polymorphic and heterogeneous than that from Central Asia. The two samples differed in the mean number of RAPD fragments N (48.76 vs. 40.40), number of polymorphic fragments P (78.7 vs. 32.3), and within-group similarity index APS (0.607 vs. 0.784). In T. g. pallasi, no significant difference in N, P, or APS was observed between samples from different localities of Dagestan or between groups of turtles with four- or five-clawed forelegs. A dendrogram of genetic similarity between the species and subspecies under study contained two clusters, one comprising all A. horsfieldii individuals and the other, all turtles of the genus Testudo. In the latter, T. marginata and T. kleinmanni showed higher similarity to each other than to T. graeca. The four T. graeca subspecies clustered separately from each other with a high reliability, T. g. nikolskii and T. g ibera (Turkey) being more similar to each other than to T. g. terrestris or T. g. pallasi. The possible causes of the presence of four claws on forelegs of turtles from Dagestan and the relationships among members of the genus Testudo were discussed.

AB  - Background
Leptospiral infections in poikilothermic (cold blooded) animals have received very little attention and the literature concerning natural infections of these animals is limited. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of leptospiral antibodies in reptiles, imported into Slovenia and intended to be pets in close contact with humans. A total of 297 reptiles (22 snakes, 210 lizards and 65 turtles) were tested for specific antibodies against serovars of Leptospira interrogans sensu stricto using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Live cultures of different serovars were used as antigens. MAT was performed according to standard procedures and the degree of reaction was interpreted by estimating the percentage of agglutinated leptospires. Samples showing titres of ≥ 50 against one or more serovars were considered as positive.

AB  - In contrast to genotypic sex determination (GSD), temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in amniotic vertebrates eludes intuitive connections to Fisherian sex-ratio theory. Attempts to draw such connections have driven over 50 years of research on the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms (SDM), perhaps most prominently among species in the order Testudines. Despite regular advancements in our understanding of this topic, no efforts have been published compiling the entirety of data on the relationships between incubation temperature and offspring sex in any taxonomic group. Here, we present the Reptilian Offspring Sex and Incubation Environment (ROSIE) database, a comprehensive set of over 7,000 individual measurements of offspring sex ratios in the order Testudines as well as SDM classifications for 149 species. As the name suggests, we plan to expand the taxonomic coverage of ROSIE to include all non-avian reptiles and will regularly release updates to maintain its comprehensive nature. This resource will enable crucial future research probing the ecology and evolution of SDM, including the presumed sensitivity of TSD to rapid environmental change.

AB  - We examined a total of 65 specimens of the Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca Linnaeus, 1758 from three distinct localities in the western Taurus Mountains of the Mediterranean region of Turkey: Kalkan (12 ♀, 14 ), Ciglikara (6 ♀, 7 ♂), and Akseki (7 ♀, 19 ♂). For morphological comparisons 15 morphometric characters and 17 ratios developed by combination of characters were investigated. Post-ANOVA pairwise analysis (Tukey’s) across all groups verified sexual dimorphism in the Kalkan and Ciglikara populations in terms of the following ratios: plastron length/plastron width 2 ( p = 0.02) and straight carapace length/femoral suture length ( p = 0.04), respectively. Females in all three populations are larger than males, and in the Ciglikara population individuals are larger than those from other populations (ANOVA F (2.22) = 16.28, p < 0.0001). The maximum straight carapace length measured was of a female in the Ciglikara population (295 mm). This is a new record size for Turkish tortoises. Discriminant analysis based on 13 ratios confirms that the Kalkan population tends to differ from the other two populations. This difference was more clear between Akseki and Kalkan.

AB  - Body mass and length data from large samples of wild Testudo graeca, T. hermanni and T. marginata in Greece were used to assess body mass condition. Mass-length relationships differed significantly between the sexes (females being heavier) and among the species ( T. marginata being least heavy). Mass-length relationships for each species and sex were used to calculate the condition index (CI) log (M/M'), where M is observed mass and M’ is mass predicted from length, which is equal to residuals from the regression of log M on log length. It was possible to use the empirical mass-length relationships from one population of T. hermanni to calculate CI in other populations of substantially different adult size. The seasonal pattern of the CI varied with latitude, with a sharper and later peak further north, and habitat, declining more in summer at a xeric coastal site. The seasonal patterns of CI in T. graeca and T. marginata were similar, with sharper and later peaks compared to T. hermanni. These seasonal patterns of CI were related to differences in activity and food availability among species and sites. The variability of the CI was similar in all three species, with most values between -0.1 and +0.1; seasonal variation was of relatively low amplitude, with a range of about 0.05 between the highest and lowest monthly means.

AB  - AbstractClutch, egg and hatchling characteristics in the Souss Valley tortoises Testudo graeca soussensis (Testudinidae) from an arid steppe area of west-central Morocco were investigated in semi captivity in spring–early summer 2011. Mating activity occurs twice in the year, mainly in early spring and for a short period in mid-autumn. The egg laying period lasts from late May to early July. The mean clutch size, based on the first clutches, is 3.44±1.33 eggs per clutch (range: 1–5 eggs); the eggs are elongated in shape. The mean relative egg mass and relative clutch mass are 1.70±0.28% and 4.06±1.32%, respectively. No egg variable was significantly correlated with the female body size (carapace length and body weight). The mean incubation duration of artificially incubated eggs (at 31°C) is 70±5.7 days. The body mass at hatching is 12.8±0.6 g. The carapace is sub-circular and more domed than that of adults. The obtained data are compared to those reported for other populations and subspecies of T. graeca...

AB  - Population fluctuations are driven by a combination of multiple factors, which can be classified into endogenous and exogenous. Endogenous factors are directly related to density-dependent forces, whereas exogenous factors are environmental drivers (e.g. climate). Several studies have reported the effects of endogenous and exogenous factors using exponential population models in mammals, birds or insects, but few works have explored the effects on reptiles, specifically in tortoises. In this study, we developed logistic population growth models to decipher the role of these factors on the population dynamics of the spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca. The role of environmental drivers in the distribution, movement, survival, reproduction or individual growth has been described for this species in previous works, but no studies have examined the effects of both endogenous and exogenous factors in population growth rates. Using long-term data of T. graeca in southeastern Iberian Peninsula (1999–2013), we fitted non-linear logistic models with endogenous and exogenous effects. The results showed that endogenous processes are important drivers of the population dynamics of this species, and that exogenous factors, such as freezing hours in winter, also directly affect the population growth rate. Intolerance of extreme winter temperatures may especially affect hatchlings and juvenile tortoises. Our models also showed that perturbations (i.e. a fire occurred during the monitoring period) have a lasting impact by reducing the carrying capacity of the population. This study shows that simple quantitative approaches based on population dynamic theory are useful for deciphering the ecological mechanisms underlying dynamics of tortoise populations.

AB  - The prevalence of Salmonella infection was determined in a group of spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) seized during two smuggling attempts and in a population of captive Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) sheltered in a wildlife rescue centre. Salmonella spp. was isolated in 81 of 220 (36.8%) and in 17 of 67 (25.4%) cloacal swabs collected from the T. graeca and T. hermanni tortoises respectively. Overall, a total of 21 different Salmonella serotypes were found. Some of these serotypes are common to terrestrial chelonians while others have never been reported. All cultured serotypes were non-typhoidal but nonetheless many of these have been previously reported as source of human outbreaks of reptile-related salmonellosis. Eighty-two per cent and 5.3% of the isolates were resistant to two and three anti-microbial agents respectively. However, the isolates were highly susceptible to the anti-microbials of choice for the treatment of salmonellosis such as cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. Our findings confirm that tortoises can be considered a reservoir for Salmonella and that care should be employed when handling and breeding these animals. Tight surveillance should be enforced to avoid illegal importation and prevent the trading of live tortoises, carriers of zoonotic pathogens.

AB  - ABSTRACT Considerable attention has been given lately to the effects of habitat fragmentation and destruction on wildlife. Here, we summarize their effects on animal abundance and plant cover during a three-year study period (1987–90) of the sand dunes of the coastal plain of Israel. Populations of the gray monitor Varanus griseus, the spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca, and the mountain gazelle Gazella gazella in the study area declined markedly and plant cover increased significantly. Habitat destruction and fragmentation, introduced animals (especially dogs and carrion crows), a continuing change in the native herbivore fauna, and blockage of wind-borne sand are all believed to be responsible for the observed changes. We recommend that small areas, unsuitable for full protection, be declared “city reserves,” to be used for educational and recreational purposes. Nature reserves need to be managed in order to maintain the existing fauna and flora.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
				<jats:p> Spur-thighed tortoise is a vulnerable species, the local declines of populations require an imperative need for conservation. Research on habitat use is essential for understanding population ecology. To investigate the home range and movement patterns we studied a population which occupies an enclosed area of 30 ha in northeastern Algeria. Studies of movement showed that home ranges were substantially smaller than in Spain. This difference was due to the high trophic availability with significant richness in plants which make part of the diet of the tortoise. The home range varied from 0.287 ha in males to 0.354 ha for females; there was no sexual difference. The males are the most active with a distance of 3.79 m/d. Females and juveniles are respectively about 2.25 m/d and 2.11 m/d. The distance moved each day do not vary significantly by sex and ages. Results from this study are important for establishing conservation strategies for this vulnerable species.</jats:p>

AB  - The spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca L., 1758) is classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN. In this context, it is important to explore the factors affecting its populations to set up an effective conservation plan. The present study was carried out in seven localities of Morocco with the objective to determine the ticks parasitizing this tortoise and their prevalence in relation to host characteristics and environmental factors. We examined 392 free-living tortoises for the presence of ticks during the spring 2018. A total number of 2238 adult ticks (no immature tick detected) were collected and all identified as Hyalomma aegyptium. Infection with at least one tick was detected in 77.6% ± 6.5 of the total tortoises. The infestation prevalence varied according to localities. Infestation intensity varied from 1.5 to 12, while tick abundance ranged from 0.65 to 12 ticks/tortoise. Male tortoises were more infested than females (P < 0.01) and the infestation was age-dependant. Our statistical result provides that the best model drivers tick parasitism was which included locality and age. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of the high intensity of H. aegyptium infestation on the tortoise’s health status and to assess the potential transmission of zoonotic pathogens.

AB  - Sixteen specimens of Testudo graeca Linnaeus 1758 from 2 adjacent localities (Meke and Acigol) in Central Anatolia were measured. Morphological characters standardised for straight carapace length (SCL) were compared with original raw values from Testudo populations from Aegean and south-eastern Turkey. The post-ANOVA pairwise analysis (Tukey's) across all groups verified sexual dimorphism in the Central Anatolian populations in terms of anal suture length (P < 0.05) and plastron width 2 (P < 0.05). Discriminant analysis based on standardised values provided 89.3% and 92.6% correct classification among males and females, respectively. The difference was clearer between the Aegean and Central Anatolian populations, with a more domed carapace (CH) in the males and shorter plastron length (PL) and plastron width 2 (PW2) in the females of the Aegean population in comparison with the Central Anatolian population.

AB  - In free-ranging reptile populations, bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic pathogens may affect hosts through impairment in movements, thermoregulation, reproduction, survival, and population dynamics. The speckled dwarf tortoise (Chersobius [Homopus] signatus) is a threatened species that is mostly restricted to the Succulent Karoo biome in South Africa, and little information on pathogens of this species is available yet. We derived baseline parameters for five males and five females that were captured to genetically enhance a conservation breeding program in Europe. Upon collection of the tortoises, ticks were removed and identified. Immediately upon arrival in Europe, ocular, nasal, oral and cloacal swabs were taken for viral, bacteriological and mycological examinations. Fecal samples were collected before and 1 month after fenbendazole treatment, and analyzed for parasites. A panel of PCR, aiming to detect herpesviruses, adenoviruses and iridoviruses, was carried out. Samples were negative for viruses, while bacteriological examination yielded detectable growth in 82.5% of the swabs with a mean load of 16 × 107 ± 61 × 108 colony forming units (CFU) per swab, representing 34 bacterial species. Cloacal and oral swabs yielded higher detectable growth loads than nasal and ocular swabs, but no differences between sexes were observed. Fungi and yeasts (mean load 5 × 103 ± 13 × 103 CFU/swab) were detected in 25% of the swabs. All pre-treatment fecal samples were positive for oxyurid eggs, ranging from 200 to 2400 eggs per gram of feces, whereas after the treatment a significantly reduced egg count (90–100% reduction) was found in seven out of 10 individuals. One remaining individual showed 29% reduction, and two others had increased egg counts. In five tortoises, Nycthocterus spp. and coccidian oocysts were also identified. Soft ticks were identified as Ornithodoros savignyi. Our baseline data from clinically healthy individuals will help future studies to interpret prevalences of microorganisms in speckled dwarf tortoise populations. The study population did not appear immediately threatened by current parasite presence.

AB  - A complex wide-range study on the haemoproteid parasites of chelonians was carried out for the first time. Altogether, 811 samples from four tortoise species from an extensive area between western Morocco and eastern Afghanistan and between Romania and southern Syria were studied by a combination of microscopic and molecular-genetic methods. Altogether 160 Haemoproteus-positive samples were gathered in the area between central Anatolia and eastern Afghanistan. According to variability in the cytochrome b gene, two monophyletic evolutionary lineages were distinguished; by means of microscopic analysis it was revealed that they corresponded to two previously described species-Haemoproteus anatolicum and Haemoproteus caucasica. Their distribution areas overlap only in a narrow strip along the Zagros Mts. range in Iran. This fact suggests the involvement of two different vector species with separated distribution. Nevertheless, no vectors were confirmed. According to phylogenetic analyses, H. caucasica represented a sister group to H. anatolicum, and both of them were most closely related to H. pacayae and H. peltocephali, described from South American river turtles. Four unique haplotypes were revealed in the population of H. caucasica, compared with seven haplotypes in H. anatolicum. Furthermore, H. caucasica was detected in two tortoise species, Testudo graeca and Testudo horsfieldii, providing evidence that Haemoproteus is not strictly host-specific to the tortoise host species.

AB  - LARGE TELESDOPES.—Muchhasheenwritten during the last few months with reference to the usefulness or non-usefulness of large telescopes. That the verdict is given in favour of the former is not at all surprising, for are we not far away from the limit, if there be one, beyond which larger instruments will be available? Dr. Common has many times pointed out the practicability of constructing large reflectors (his five-foot being a good example of the type of instrument he could enlarge), while the Lick instrument, the work of the Clarks, is really only a beginning of what will he done in large telescope building. For refractors it has many times been urged that the increase in size of lenses involves such a thickness that much light is thereby lost by absorption. M. Alvan G Clark, with reference to this particular point, says a few words in Astronomy and Astrophysics for April, in which he points out that such is not the case. Greater aperture means greater light-grasping power, and as it is quite unnecessary to considerably increase the thickness of the lens, the former predominates over the latter. With the forty-inch discs, he says, only a combined thickness of four inches is required, and with lenses of an object-glas of even six feet aperture a combined thickness of only six inches would be necessary. It is pleasing to hear through him that a steady improvement is being made in manufacture of glass, and that the present discs arc infinitely superior to the early ones, and “who knows,” as Mr. Clark says, “how soon still more transparent glass may be at hand.”

AB  - Energetic aspects of female reproduction are described for the tortoises Testudo graeca, Testudo marginata, and Testudo hermanni (three populations of different body size) from northern Greece. Egg width increased with body size in some populations, but smaller individuals produced more elongate eggs, and egg weight was not related to body size. This method for overcoming the constraint of the width of the pelvic canal means that egg width is a poor measure of egg size. Clutch size, clutch mass, and annual egg production varied with body size between populations. Mean relative clutch mass ranged from 4 to 7%, and was highest in the three populations of T. hermanni. All populations laid two or three clutches per year, based on the total number of eggs and large follicles divided by clutch size. Multiple clutches reflect the morphological constraint of packing shelled eggs within the body, rather than energy accumulation during the nesting period. Material for reproduction was stored in growing follicles ra...

AB  - We assessed the dynamics of a population of spur-thighed tortoises, Testudo graeca, placed under long-term protection from human interference. We estimated demographic parameters and constructed vertical life tables based on age structures for two different study periods separated by a 12-yr interval. Average age at maturity was 6.9 yr for males and 8.5 yr for females. Clutch size varied with female size, but tended to be constant among years. Average annual female fecundity over 9 yr was 8.4 eggs and decreased significantly in years of high rainfall. Females seemed to reproduce yearly, but with a constantly low output, probably maximising both their long-term reproductive potential and the probability of producing offspring during favourable years for hatchling survival. Adult survival was high and constant between periods. Juvenile survivorship from egg to 6 yr and recruitment into the 5-8-yr-old cohorts were significantly higher in the second period. Life tables indicated a predominantly negative demographic trend for the first period, with an average population increase rate of 0.977, and an overall positive tendency for the second period, with an average increase rate of 1.091. These figures suggest that the population experienced a variation that was closer to the maximum estimates for the first period, mediated mainly by an increase in juvenile recruitment. The data indicate that, besides high adult survival rates, occasional high juvenile recruitment bouts may have an important regulatory effect on the population dynamics of Testudo graeca.

AB  - In a population of about 130 tortoises, consisting mainly of Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) and Four-toed tortoises (Agrionemys horsfieldii), 50% of the reptiles died within 3 months in autumn 1987. Post mortem analysis of 5 necropsied turtles revealed thick, caseous coatings in the upper digestive tract, hepatomegaly and enteritis. By microbiological examination a lot of ubiquitous bacteria could be isolated. By electron microscopy of concentrated and negatively stained gut specimens herpes virus particles were found in two Hermann's tortoises and one Four-toed tortoise. Isolation experiments in embryonic turtle tissue cultures showed no evidence of a cytopathogenic agent. The results are discussed in respect of their importance for the high mortality observed in the population of mediterranean land turtles.

AB  - Despite being one of the most charismatic elements of the Mediterranean Basin fauna and its threatened status, the western Mediterranean range of Testudo graeca is at present very poorly known. The present work provides the most detailed geographical and ecological description for the North African clade of T. graeca so far. We gathered 283 occurrence data of T. graeca in North Africa and modelled the distribution by means of presence-only distribution modelling tools. The obtained model was then projected to southern Europe in order to explore whether the environmental characteristics of European populations fall into the predicted niche of the species in North Africa. T. graeca showed a wide environmental range in North Africa. Presence localities ranged from the sea level to 2090 m of altitude and from 116 to 1093 mm of annual precipitation. The presence-only model indicates that distribution in North Africa is mainly related to rainfall, specifically rainfall values in the wettest and coldest quarter of the year. The distribution model showed a range of ca. 1 000 000 km 2 . The projection of the model to southern Europe showed that the southern Iberian and Balkan Peninsulas, as well as most Mediterranean islands, present climatic conditions within those found in the range of the species in North Africa.

AB  - Armoured, rigid bodied animals, such as Testudines, must self-right should they find themselves in an inverted position. The ability to self-right is an essential biomechanical and physiological process that influences survival and ultimately fitness. Traits that enhance righting ability may consequently offer an evolutionary advantage. However, the energetic requirements of self-righting are unknown. Using respirometry and kinematic video analysis, we examined the metabolic cost of self-righting in the terrestrial Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise and compared this to the metabolic cost of locomotion at a moderate, easily sustainable speed. We found that self-righting is, relatively, metabolically expensive and costs around two times the mass-specific power required to walk. Rapid movements of the limbs and head facilitate successful righting however, combined with the constraints of breathing whilst upside down, contribute a significant metabolic cost. Consequently, in the wild, these animals should favour environments or behaviours where the risk of becoming inverted is reduced.

AB  - Much of our current knowledge about the genetic dynamics in range expansions originates from models, simulations and microcosm experiments that need to becorroboratedby field data. Here, we report a neutral genetic pattern that matches the predictions of the genetic surfing theory. Genetic surfing occurs when repeated founding events and genetic drift act on the wave of advance of an expanding population, promoting strong spatial structure. In the range expansion of the tortoise Testudo graeca from North Africa to southeastern Spain, we found several genetic signatures consistent with surfing: a decrease of genetic diversity with distance from the initial founder area, clinal patterns in allele frequencies, rare African alleles which have become

AB  - The blackness and physical appearance of Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca L.) are recorded in field populations. The inter-relationships between carapace and plastron length, fourth vertebral scute width and other morphometric characters are related to growth. The rear fontanelle is larger in males and the plastron length correspondingly smaller. The relationship between carapace length (y) in mm and body mass (x) in g is strongly allometric and given by y= 16.63 x0–34. The maximum carapace lengths recorded for male and female T. graeca graeca L. in NW. Africa are 151 and 198 mm, and for larger T. graeca ibera Pallas in W. Turkey and NE. Greece 208 and 218 mm, respectively. The growth annuli of epidermal scutes are deposited yearly until external growth ceases. The number is used to assess the age of wild animals. Tortoises can be full-grown by 19 years but some, especially slower growing ones, deposit further annuli. The biggest mean growth increments occur up to 7 years with the largest in individuals over the 5–12 year period. The proportion of immature tortoises, adult sex ratios, size and body mass structure, age distribution, annual recruitment and survivorship until full-grown, and abundance (sighting frequency) are compared in northern and southern range populations of NW. African T. g. graeca and S. Anatolian and SE. European (Thrace and Macedonia) ones of T. g. ibera. These are discussed in relation to other tortoise species.

The antiproteic-hormone antibodies STH, LTH and ACTH are each fixed on a well individualized cellular type. The anti-glycoproteic hormone antibodies identify a TSH cell; but two cell populations respond to the same beta LH antigonadotropic antibody. The question of the unicity or the duality of the gonadotrope cells is expressed.

AB  - Two types of pathogens cause highly contagious upper respiratory tract diseases (URTD) in Chelonians: testudinid herpesviruses (TeHV) and a mycoplasma (Mycoplasma agassizii). In captivity, these infections are frequent and can provoke outbreaks. Pet trade generates international flow of tortoises, often without sanitary checking; individuals intentionally or accidentally released in the wild may spread pathogens. A better understanding of the transmission of infectious agents from captivity to wild tortoises is needed. Many exotic individuals have been introduced in populations of the endangered western Hermann s tortoise (Testudo hermanni hermanni), notably spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca). We assessed the presence of TeHV and mycoplasma in native western Hermann s tortoises and in potential pet vectors in south-eastern France. Using a large sample (N=572 tortoises), this study revealed the worrying presence of herpesvirus in 7 free-ranging individuals (3 sub-populations). Additionally, Mycoplasma agassizii was detected in 15 of the 18 populations sampled with a frequency ranging from 3.4% (1 of 29 tortoises) to 25% (3 of 12 tortoises) 23.5 4 (1/29 tested) to 25 (3/12)%.. Exotic spur-thighed tortoises showed high frequency of mMycoplasma infection in captivity (18.2%) and in individuals (50%) found in native Hermann s tortoise sub-populations, suggesting that this species could be a significant vector. The paucity of information of TeHV on European tortoise URTD in natural settings, especially in combination with mycoplasma, prompts for further studies. Indeed, sick tortoises remain concealed and may not be easily detected in the field. Our results indicate that both the prevalence and health impact of URTD are high and should be scrutinized in the field.

AB  - Using mtDNA sequences and 12 microsatellite loci, we compare populations of Testudo graeca from Sardinia and North Africa. The observed pattern of almost no differentiation combined with reduced variation in the Sardinian population is consistent with introduction in prehistoric or historic times from what is now Tunisia and neighbouring Algeria. Furthermore, in the light of the recently published recommendation to eradicate the non-native T. graeca from Italy, we review recent studies on the archaeological and fossil record, on the phylogeography and population genetics of the three other chelonian species occurring in Sardinia (Emys orbicularis, T. hermanni, T. marginata). We conclude that the extant Sardinian populations of all four species are not native. However, they are and should be safeguarded under EC law (Council Regulation No 338/97 on the Protection of Species of Wild Fauna and Flora; Flora Fauna Habitat Directive: Appendix IV, Art. 12) because they serve as a back-up for the declining mainland populations. Moreover, these populations constitute an important part of the human-shaped natural heritage of the Mediterranean.

				<jats:p>Testudo graeca is one of the two species of tortoises from Romania, the other one being Testudo hermanni. It is well known that this species has a broad but fragmented distribution range and this fact labels this species as Vulnerable in the IUCN Red List. The population of Testudo graeca ibera from the Natura 2000 site “Marine dunes from Agigea” is characterized by a high percentage of injuries (84%) from the total of 43 individuals found alive. A high percentage of individuals have injuries on all the plates from carapace and plastron. All lesions appear to be chronic, suggesting that there is a series of predisposing factors, such as: inadequate terrain (concrete, metal, broken glass and other hard objects), high-density dog population and coprophagia, which could be a sign of unbalanced nutrition. This is the first report of a population of Testudo graeca which has such a high percentage of individuals with shell damage.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract Human behavior is an important factor in understanding the impact of exurban sprawl (i.e. low-density rural home development) on native species. We studied the long-term effect of pet collection on populations of the threatened spur-thighed tortoise by residents of exurban areas in southeastern Spain. We built a system dynamic model using authors’ own data and bibliographic data about tortoise population dynamics, the housing development dynamics, and the behavior of local residents toward this species. The model includes two submodels (spur-thighed population dynamics and households dynamics) interconnected through a tortoise collection submodel. Simulations showed that exurban intensity (i.e. size of a housing development) is essential in determining the intensity and speed of tortoise population decrease. Populations may become extinct due to collection in areas around medium to large housing developments (above 650 houses). Low housing development causes a considerable reduction of original population levels (more than 14%). Environmental education program by itself, with the aim of reducing the willingness of new residents to keep tortoises in captivity, does not seem very effective. The quality and the speed with which the educational program is initialized are key factors in determining the effectiveness of the educational program. The scenarios simulation results suggest that the integration of policies of strong development constraints and educational programs are the most effective way in reducing the impact of exurban development on tortoise populations.

AB  - Persistent grooves (growth-lines) in keratin formed during periods of slowed growth have been used to estimate age and growth rates of turtles since the midnineteenth century (Agassiz, 1857). Since then, many studies have used the growth lines (also termed growth rings or annuli) on the surface of plastral or carapacial scutes (reviewed by Gibbons, 1976), or rings of varying calcium matrix density in bones (reviewed by Castanet, 1982). Age has been estimated by enumeration of these growth lines, while growth of the carapace has been reconstructed by relating the past length of scutes (growth-line length) to past carapace length (Sergeev, 1937). The periodicity of growth-line addition should be tested wherever possible by directly comparing numbers of growth lines added with time elapsed (Dapson, 1980). Despite the great number of studies using growth lines for age estimates or growth studies in turtles (e.g., Chelydra serpentina: Gibbons, 1968a; Hammer, 1969; Graham and Perkins, 1976; Christiansen and Burken, 1979; Chrysemys picta: Sexton, 1959; Gibbons, 1967, 1968b; Wilbur, 1975a, b; MacCulloch and Secoy, 1983; Clemmys guttata: Ernst, 1975; Clemmys muhlenbergii: Ernst, 1977; Emydoidea blandingii: Graham and Doyle, 1977; Graptemys pseudogeographica: Moll, 1976; Macroclemys temmincki: Dobie, 1971; Testudo graeca: Lambert, 1982), only three previous studies of turtles have directly tested the periodicity of growthline deposition using recaptures of the same individuals. In Illinois, sliders (Pseudemys scripta: Cagle, 1946), and in Michigan, wood turtles (Clemmys insculpta: Harding, 1985) added single growth lines each year as juveniles, but deposited lines less frequently as they aged. However, a slider population in Panama added multiple growth lines each year (Moll and Legler, 1971). Apart from comparisons of recaptured individuals, periodicity of growth lines has been 'verified' by comparisons with growth rings in bones for snapping turtles (Hammer, 1969) and painted turtles (Chrysemys picta: MacCulloch and Secoy, 1983). Age estimtes based on growth rings in bones have been successful for many species of reptiles (Castanet, 1982), but the technique must be calibrated carefully for each species, and preferably for each population (Groupe d'Etude Practique de Squelettochronologie, 1977). However, one non-calibrated technique should not be used to 'confirm' another, as such comparisons provide nothing reliable about age, but describe the relationship between the two dependent variables (Dapson, 1980). The present study was undertaken to test whether growth lines were deposited annually on the fourth vertebral scutes of snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina serpentina) in a northern population. This scute was selected as it appeared to suffer less from wear than others, and because it was possible to reconstruct growth from this scute since it lay along the line of measurement of carapace length. This study was conducted in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, from May 1976 through July 1985, in the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources Wildlife Research Area (45?35'N, 78?30'W). Turtles were captured in the North Madawaska River watershed in lakes of 45 ha and smaller. The river itself is small

AB  - Hyalomma aegyptium (Linnaeus, 1758) (Ixodida: Ixodidae) has recently been confirmed as a carrier of numerous pathogenic, including zoonotic, agents. Four environmentally distinct regions of Algeria, located between the humid coastal zone and the arid Saharan Atlas range, were selected in order to compare differences in tick abundance among localities, and the correlations between tick abundance and host population characteristics and other environmental conditions. Sampling was carried out during May and early June in 2010-2012. A total of 1832 H. aegyptium were removed from 201 tortoises. Adult ticks accounted for 52% of the collection. In the pre-adult stages, larvae were dominant. Data on prevalence, intensity (mean ± standard deviation, range) and abundance of tick infestation were calculated for each locality. Locally, prevalences reached 100%. The sex ratio was biased in favour of males (4.2). Intensities of infestation differed significantly among the localities studied for all developmental stages of the tick. The intensity of infestation by adult ticks was positively correlated to the size of the tortoise and with tortoise population density in the habitat. However, findings for immature tick stages were independent of both variables. No significant correlations between infestation intensities and the climatic parameters tested were found. Immature ticks were observed to prefer the front parts of their tortoise hosts, whereas the majority of adults were attached to the rear parts.

AB  - Ranaviral disease in amphibians has been studied intensely during the last decade, as associated mass-mortality events are considered to be a global threat to wild animal populations. Several studies have also included other susceptible ectothermic vertebrates (fish and reptiles), but only very few cases of ranavirus infections in lizards have been previously detected. In this study, we focused on clinically suspicious lizards and tested these animals for the presence of ranaviruses. Virological screening of samples from lizards with increased mortality and skin lesions over a course of four years led to the detection of ranaviral infections in seven different groups. Affected species were: brown anoles (Anolis sagrei), Asian glass lizards (Dopasia gracilis), green anoles (Anolis carolinensis), green iguanas (Iguana iguana), and a central bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps). Purulent to ulcerative-necrotizing dermatitis and hyperkeratosis were diagnosed in pathological examinations. All animals tested positive for the presence of ranavirus by PCR and a part of the major capsid protein (MCP) gene of each virus was sequenced. Three different ranaviruses were isolated in cell culture. The analyzed portions of the MCP gene from each of the five different viruses detected were distinct from one another and were 98.4-100% identical to the corresponding portion of the frog virus 3 (FV3) genome. This is the first description of ranavirus infections in these five lizard species. The similarity in the pathological lesions observed in these different cases indicates that ranaviral infection may be an important differential diagnosis for skin lesions in lizards.

AB  - Body size is an ecologically important variable in animals. The geographical size variation of most snakes and some lizards counters Bergmann's rule in that, among related taxa, the larger ones live at warmer latitudes. However, exceptions notwithstanding, and despite being ectothermic, turtles as a group tend to obey Bergmann's rule. We examined this idea in Testudo graeca, ranging from Morocco to Romania and to Iran with disputed systematics, both at the global scale (using literature) and within the focal area of Israel (using museum specimens). Both globally and locally, carapace length correlated with latitude, in accordance with Bergmann's rule. The scant data on reproduction fully support the hypothesis that Bergmann's rule enables larger clutches where the climate would limit repeated clutches. The sexual size dimorphism (SSD) was approached using two methodologies: (1) ‘conventional’, using globally literature data and locally museum samples and (2) ‘innovated’, using photographs of copulating tortoises from Israel and Turkey. By each methodology, SSD emerged as being male biased in the larger-bodied populations and female biased in the smaller-bodied populations, obeying Rensch's rule. Some observations support the hypothesis that the evolution of large males serves intermale combating. Finally, Rensch's rule was found to apply separately within Anatolia and within the Levant, possibly indicating that these populations are separate.

AB  - A reduction in adult survival in long-living species may compromise population growth rates. The spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) is a long-lived reptile that is threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation. Golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), whose breeding habitats overlap that of tortoises, may predate them by dropping them onto rocks and breaking their carapaces. In SE Spain, the number of golden eagles has increased in the last decades and the abundance of their main prey (i.e., rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus) has decreased. Our aims were to 1) describe the role of tortoises in golden eagles' diet, and 2) estimate the predation impact of golden eagles on tortoises in eagles' territories and in the regional tortoise population. We collected regurgitated pellets and prey remains under eagle nests and roosts, and obtained information on tortoise abundance and population structure and rabbit abundance. We found that tortoises were an alternative prey to rabbits, so that eagles shifted to the former where the latter were scarce. The average predation rate on tortoises was very low at the two studied scales. However, eagles showed a marked selection for adult female tortoises, which led the tortoise sex ratio to be biased towards males in those eagle territories with higher tortoise predation. Whether this may compromise the spur-thighed tortoise long-term population viability locally deserves further attention.

AB  - Human-mediated secondary contact of recently diverged taxa offers valuable opportunities for studying the evolutionary mechanisms involved in the establishment and maintenance of genetic boundaries between taxa. We used mitochondrial and microsatellite markers to examine a recently introduced population of the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) of mixed origin in the Donana National Park (SW Spain). The earliest records of tortoises in Donana trace back to the 18th century, but several population reinforcements in the 20th century with animals from Morocco are well-documented. Consequently, different genetic lineages, which represent distinct subspecies, are thought to co-exist there. Our results confirmed the presence of distinct lineages by revealing that tortoises of the subspecies T. g. marokkensis were introduced into a local allochthonous T. g. graeca population. Unexpectedly, T. g. marokkensis haplotypes exclusively appeared in males, and admixture levels were statistically sex-biased toward males. The sex ratio of the population deviated from parity, with males being 2.36-fold more abundant than females. Our results indicated that population reinforcements had a strong effect on the genetic composition of this population and aggravated its sex ratio deviation. We predict that this sex-biased pattern of introgression is ephemeral and advocated to the near loss of T. g. marokkensis haplotypes.

AB  - The diet of an Algerian population of spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) was studied with the aims of exploring: (i) the variation in diet among males, females and juveniles, (ii) the relationships between consumption and relative availability of the plant species, and (iii) which plant tissues, vegeta- tive or reproductive, are eaten by tortoises. We recorded more than forty plant species at the study area, with monocot species (n = 7) having a greater percent cover than that of dicot species (n = 31 species) or Gymnospermae (n = 2). Tortoise diet was studied by categorising 4422 plant and animal fragments in faecal pellets of 20 males, 16 females and eight juveniles. Tortoises ate a wide variety of plant species, including 13 dicots and three monocots, and occasionally invertebrates. The number of fragments for a plant species was correlated with plant species cover, and plant vegetative tissues exceeded plant repro- ductive tissues in the faeces. Dicots (Fabaceae, Composeae, Primulaceae, and Caryophyllaceae) accounted for over 70% of the diet (faecal fragments). The high dietary (niche) overlap, and null model analysis (RA3 algorithm with 30,000 Monte Carlo simulations), indicate that males, females and juve- niles did not partition food resources; all three groups ate the same plant species.

AB  - From March to April 2017, a total of 147 free-ranging spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) was captured in different habitat types of northern Tunisia and examined for tick infestation. A total of 134 was infested, yielding an infestation prevalence of 91.2%. From these tortoises, 1,174 ticks were collected, a subsample (10%, n=120) of which was randomly selected and identified; the remaining ticks were stored at -80 C and examined for zoonotic pathogens. Only adult Hyalomma aegyptium were found among the subsample of ticks collected for spur-thighed tortoise. The prevalence of tick infestation did not vary significantly within the study area but differences in intensity were observed in relation to the size of tortoises and the vegetation coverage. Our results provide strong evidence that adult H. aegyptium is the predominant tick species found on wild spur-thighed tortoises in northern Tunisia, where the species is commonly traded illegally across the Mediterranean Basin. Considering the potential transmission of several zoonotic pathogens by H. aegyptium to humans, we highlight the need to develop a surveillance system to prevent the introduction and the spread of tick-borne pathogens in the Mediterranean Basin.

AB  - While picornaviruses can cause diseases in many mammals, little is known of their host range for replication in non-mammalian vertebrates. Here, a picor- navirus in liver and kidney tissues from diseased Sulawesi tortoises (Indotestudo forsteni) was genetically character- ized. Tortoise rafivirus A (ToRaV-A, KJ415177) represents a potential new genus in the family Picornaviridae, for which we propose the name ''Rafivirus''. Our finding confirms the susceptibility of reptiles to picornaviruses.

AB  - The spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca ibera Pallas, 1814 is a good example of a vulnerable long-lived CITES species, which is widely bred as a pet and can be easily reproduced in captivity. However, the high number of bred tortoises makes it difficult to monitor the international pet trade. Despite microchipping being widely recommended as an identification method, it is unsuitable for hatchlings and young tortoises because implanting the chip in chelonians can sometimes cause health problems. We believe that these disadvantages can be resolved by plastron photo documentation but this method is still not considered a valid alternative. The objective of this study was to find a method for identifying a specimen from a photograph database using morphometrics, an approach potentially more reliable than other fingerprinting methods currently used for tortoises. We propose a combined dissimilarity measure calculated from the relative differences in seam distances between two plastron photographs.

AB  - Mate searching is a key component of sexual reproduction that can have important implications for population viability, especially for the mate-finding Allee effect. Interannual sperm storage by females may be an adaptation that potentially attenuates mate limitation, but the demographic consequences of this functional trait have not been studied. Our goal is to assess the effect of female sperm storage durability on the strength of the mate-finding Allee effect and the viability of populations subject to low population density and habitat alteration. We used an individual-based simulation model that incorporates realistic representations of the demographic and spatial processes of our model species, the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca). This allowed for a detailed assessment of reproductive rates, population growth rates, and extinction probabilities. We also studied the relationship between the number of reproductive males and the reproductive rates for scenarios combining different levels of sperm storage durability, initial population density, and landscape alteration. Our results showed that simulated populations parameterized with the field-observed demographic rates collapsed for short sperm storage durability, but were viable for a durability of one year or longer. In contrast, the simulated populations with a low initial density were only viable in human-altered landscapes for sperm storage durability of 4 years. We find that sperm storage is an effective mechanism that can reduce the strength of the mate-finding Allee effect and contribute to the persistence of low-density populations. Our study highlights the key role of sperm storage in the dynamics of species with limited movement ability to facilitate reproduction in patchy landscapes or during population expansion. This study represents the first quantification of the effect of sperm storage durability on population dynamics in different landscapes and population scenarios.

AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence and intensity of gastrointestinal parasites in wild Testudo graeca tortoises in Morocco. A total of 102 tortoises sampled in two arid areas: Central Jbilets Mountains (CJM) and Sidi Kaouki Forest (SKF) were macroscopically examined and subjected to qualitative (flotation and Baermann techniques) and quantitative (McMaster technique) microscopic examinations. The identified gastrointestinal parasites belong to two nematode families (Pharyngodonidae and Ascarididae) and three protozoa families (Balantidiidae, Eimeriidae and Entamoebidae). 92.1% of tortoises were determined to harbor one or more parasite types. Oxyurid adults were the most frequently encountered with a prevalence of 22.7% and 72.4% in CJM and SKF, respectively. Nematode eggs were found in almost all individuals of both populations studied. The prevalence of protozoa was 9.1% and 3.4% in CJM and SKF, respectively. Oxyurid adults showed the highest intensity in SKF (36.5 ± 30.2) whereas, ascarid adults are absent in CJM. Statistical analysis showed that the prevalence of infection by ascarids was significantly higher in adults than in juveniles. The intensity of infection by ascarid and oxyurid eggs differed significantly between sexes and localities, respectively. Our results showed a difference of infection between the two localities, which could be in relation with habitat quality. SKF is affected by both agriculture and overgrazing. In addition, the tortoises from this locality are active for a large part of the year, which increases their chance of encountering the parasites.

 packed cell volume (PCV).  Few
 studies on glutamate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, sodium, chloride, ionized calcium and
 potassium in the European tortoises exist. Studies on cholinesterase and fructosamine are non-existent to date.
 The blood
 samples were statistically analyzed as a combined total of all samples taken
 as well as according to species, gender, age and season.
 For the tested population following mean
 values were found: Alanine aminotransferase
 1,2 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase
 25,7 U/L, glutamate dehydrogenase 1,6 U/L, alkaline
 phosphatase 287 U/L, creatine
 kinase 63,3 U/L, cholinesterase 220 U/L, uric acid
 2,9 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen 7,7 mg/dl, cholesterol 118,2 mg/dl, total bilirubin 0,03 mg/dl, glucose 79,4 mg/dl, fructosamine 116,9 µmol/L, total protein 3,45 g/dl,
 albumin 1,48 g/dl, sodium 130,7 mmol/L, chloride
 109,4 mmol/L, total calcium 3,25 mmol/L, ionized calcium 1,35 mmol/L,
 phosphate 0,88 mmol/L,  potassium 4,6 mmol/L,
 packed cell volume 24,2 %.
 Biostatistical analysis of examined parameters
 resulted in the following: Creatine kinase, cholinesterase, uric acid, fructosamine,
 sodium and chloride showed evidence of statistically significant
 differences depending on species among  European tortoises. Apart from this
 and depending on the species examined, differences with regard to packed cell
 volume, alanine aminotransferase,
 aspartate aminotransferase,
 alkaline phosphatase, urea, cholesterol, glucose,
 total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, ionized
 calcium and phosphate were demonstrated, although not to a statistically
 significant degree. Cholesterol, sodium and total calcium showed
 evidence of statistically significant gender specific differences. Aspartate aminotransferase,
 urea, total protein, albumin and chloride showed evidence of gender specific
 differences as well, but not statistically significant. Cholinesterase, however, showed a statistically
 significant age related disparity. Packed cell volume, aspartate aminotransferase,
 alkaline phosphatase, creatine
 kinase, cholesterol, glucose, total protein,
 sodium, chloride, ionized blood calcium, total calcium and phosphate also
 demonstrated differences but none of statistic relevance. Packed cell volume, alanine
 aminotransferase, aspartate
 aminotransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase,
 cholinesterase, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, sodium, chloride,
 phosphate and potassium showed statistically significant, seasonal differences.

AB  - Animal populations have developed multiple strategies to deal with environmental change. Among them, the demographic buffering strategy consists on constraining the temporal variation of the vital rate(s) (e.g., survival, growth, reproduction) that most affect(s) the overall performance of the population. Given the increase in environmental stochasticity of the current global change scenario, identifying the thresholds beyond which populations are not able to remain viable -despite their potential buffering strategies- is of utmost importance. Tortoises are known to buffer the temporal variation in survival (i.e. this vital rate has the highest contribution to the population growth rate λ) at the expense of a high variability on reproductive rates (lowest contribution to λ). To identify the potential threshold in buffering ability, here we use field data collected across a decade on 15 locations of Testudo graeca along South-Eastern Spain. We analyse the effects of environmental variables (precipitation, temperature, and NDVI) on the probability of laying eggs and the number of eggs per clutch. Finally, we couple the demographic and environmental data to parametrise integral projection models (IPMs) to simulate the effects of different scenarios of drought recurrence on population growth rate. We find that droughts negatively affect the probability of laying eggs, but the overall effects on the population growth rates of T. graeca under the current drought frequencies (one per decade) are negligible. However, increasing the annual frequency of droughts decreases the buffering ability of T. graeca populations, with a threshold at three droughts per decade. Although some species may buffer current environmental regimes by carefully orchestrating how their vital rates vary through time, a demographic buffering strategy may alone not warrant population viability in extreme regimes. Our findings support the hypothesis that the buffering strategy indeed has a threshold of effectiveness. Our methodological approach also provides a useful pipeline for ecologists and managers to determine how effective the management of environmental drivers can be for demographically buffering populations, and which scenarios may not provide long-term species persistence.

AB  - Tortoises of the Testudo graeca complex inhabit a patchy range that covers part of three continents (Africa, Europe, Asia). It extends approximately 6500 km in an east-west direction from eastern Iran to the Moroccan Atlantic coast and about 1600 km in a north-south direction from the Danube Delta to the Libyan Cyrenaica Peninsula. Recent years have seen a rapid increase of recognized taxa. Based on morphological investigations, it was suggested that this group consists of as many as 20 distinct species and is paraphyletic with respect to T. kleinmanni sensu lato and T. marginata . Based on samples from representative localities of the entire range, we sequenced the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and conducted nuclear genomic fingerprinting with ISSR PCR. The T. graeca complex is monophyletic and sister to a taxon consisting of T. kleinmanni sensu lato and T. marginata . The T. graeca complex comprises six well-supported mtDNA clades (A-F). Highest diversity is found in the Caucasian Region, where four clades occur in close neighbourhood. This suggests, in agreement with the fossil record, the Caucasian Region as a radiation centre. Clade A corresponds to haplotypes from the East Caucasus. It is the sister group of another clade (B) from North Africa and western Mediterranean islands. Clade C includes haplotypes from western Asia Minor, the southeastern Balkans and the western and central Caucasus Region. Its sister group is a fourth, widely distributed clade (D) from southern and eastern Asia Minor and the Levantine Region (Near East). Two further clades are distributed in Iran (E, northwestern and central Iran; F, eastern Iran). Distinctness of these six clades and sister group relationships of (A + B) and (C + D) are well-supported; however, the phylogeny of the resulting four clades (A + B), (C + D), E and F is poorly resolved. While in a previous study (Fritz et al., 2005a) all traditionally recognized Testudo species were highly distinct using mtDNA sequences and ISSR fingerprints, we detected within the T. graeca complex no nuclear genomic differentiation paralleling mtDNA clades. We conclude that all studied populations of the T. graeca complex are conspecific under the Biological Species Concept. There is major incongruence between mtDNA clades and morphologically defined taxa. Morphologically well-defined taxa, like T. g. armeniaca or T. g. floweri , nest within clades comprising also geographically neighbouring, but morphologically distinctive populations of other taxa (clade A: T. g. armeniaca , T. g. ibera , T. g. pallasi ; clade D: T. g. anamurensis , T. g. antakyensis , T. g. floweri , T. g. ibera , T. g. terrestris ), while sequences of morphologically similar tortoises of the same subspecies ( T. g. ibera sensu stricto or T. g. ibera sensu lato) scatter over two or three genetically distinct clades (A, C or A, C, D, respectively). This implies that pronounced morphological plasticity, resulting in phenotypes shaped by environmental pressure, masks genetic differentiation. To achieve a more realistic taxonomic arrangement reflecting mtDNA clades, we propose reducing the number of T. graeca subspecies considerably and regard in the eastern part of the range five subspecies as valid ( T. g. armeniaca , T. g. buxtoni , T. g. ibera , T. g. terrestris , T. g. zarudnyi ). As not all North African taxa were included in the present study, we refrain from synonymizing North African taxa with T. g. graeca (mtDNA clade B) that represents a further valid subspecies.

AB  - Understanding how species have responded to past climate changes might inform how current climate change may affect species. However, current perspectives on species’ response to Quaternary cycles mainly stem from studies on mid and high latitudes and limited information is available at lower latitudes. In these systems a greater variation in individual species’ responses to glacial cycles has been suggested, but we lack of clear case studies of such variations. Here, by means of ecological niche modelling, we characterized the niche differentiation of the five subspecies of the tortoise Testudo graeca in north Africa and described the range dynamics suffered by each of the subspecies since the Last Glacial Maxima. Molecular data was employed to infer past population dynamics.



The five subspecies present a clear niche differentiation, particularly in relation to rainfall, covering a range from semiarid to humid species. The ecological differentiation among subspecies promotes very different, even opposite, post-glacial range dynamics. Since the Last Glacial Maxima, the ranges have either expanded (T. g. graeca), contracted (T. g. marokkensis), shifted northwards (T. g. soussensis) or remained stable (T. g. cyrenaica and T. g. nabeulensis). Molecular data supported the majority of these range dynamics. Our work exemplifies how, in a climate change scenario, phylogenetically very close taxa (i.e. at the subspecies level) might experience strikingly different biogeographical dynamics due to former niche differentiation. Our work supports an individualistic response to glacial cycles, which can be particularly strong in lower latitudes. In these areas precipitation changes during glacial periods may have strongly affected distribution ranges in idiosyncratic ways. We hypothesize that in those species limited by precipitation the response to glacial cycles (and climate changes) is more unpredictable than in those limited by temperature.

AB  - The Testudo graeca (i.e., Greek Tortoise or Spur-thighed Tortoise) origin in Western Europe is a subject of debate within the scientific community. The species is a part of the current Spanish biodiversity, with three isolated populations, located in the south-eastern (Almeria and Murcia) and south-western (Doñana National Park, Andalusia) areas of the Iberian Peninsula, and in the Mallorca Island (Balearic Islands). Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, putative references to the presence of Testudo graeca in the Iberian paleontological and archaeozoological records were relatively common. However, many of them were refuted in subsequent papers and, those that were not, are currently considered as doubtful. The aim of this work is to present and describe the oldest indisputable remains of Testudo graeca in the Iberian Peninsula. They correspond to several individuals, hitherto unpublished, recovered as grave goods in two tombs at the Plaza Marqués de Busianos 5 site (Valencia, eastern Spain), dated between the first and second centuries AD.

AB  - A reliable estimation of individuals’ age is helpful to conduct demographic studies on wildlife populations. In tortoises, many studies have estimated individuals’ age by counting growth rings on their scutes, assuming one ring per year (1:1 ratio). However, the accuracy of this method is controversial. The ring deposition pattern can vary depending on species, or even populations, and should be studied comprehensively. We studied the ring deposition pattern of Testudo graeca in southeastern Iberian Peninsula, using recaptures of 156 individuals between 2004 and 2010. We used a novel approach to explore the ring deposition pattern and to test possible differences between localities and individuals. Our results revealed that most analysed individuals (57.4%) showed a 1:1 ratio, in which rings were deposited during months of activity (spring to autumn). However, we found a trend to count less rings than years, which underestimated 1 year every 3 or 4 years. No differences in the deposition patterns were found among sites, sizes or sexes because the halt in growth during hibernation equally affects all tortoises in all sites. Our results support that the assumed 1:1 ratio in the assignment of individuals’ age is too simplistic. Since ring deposition patterns are complex, the use of statistical approaches capable of handling deviations from the assumed deposition ratios can help to better depict population age structures.

AB  - The land of the "Cetatea Histria" Museum Complex, the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve, holds a large population of Testudo graeca, relatively well isolated due to the existing fence around the land of museum and the lack of suitable habitat in the vicinity. The relative high density of individuals in this area, 1.68 individuals / ha, and low recapture rates, 9.25%, suggests a large population size. The presence of juveniles and the lack of individuals with tick infestation or traces of human violence on carapace or plastron indicate a viable population which occupies an area with limited human activity.

AB  - Demography and population biology aspects of the Moorish tortoise, Testudo graeca graeca were studied in the Parc National d'El Kala, north-eastern Algeria. Density, which was assessed by capture-mark-recapture procedures in a study plot of 30 ha surface, was 3.73 individuals × ha−1. Adult sex-ratio was nearly equal (1.06 : 1). Sexual maturity was reached at 7-8 years of age in the males and at 9-11 years in the females. The mean age of tortoises was 13.8 ± 6.4 years (n = 88). Maximum longevity was over 20 years in both sexes. The females reached larger body size than the males. The growth was rapid during the early years of age in both sexes, and tended to stop completely by the 9-12 years of life in the males and by the 8-10 years in the females. The instantaneous growth of adults which were recaptured in multiple years indicated an average growth rate of 11.34 mm/year in the males, and of 26.30 mm/year in the females. Mortality was estimated at 3.94%. The main mortality cause for the tortoises of this population was the occurrence of fires spreading throughout the study area. These data are of interest because demographic patterns of Testudo graeca seem to vary not only because of their relative genetical variability, but also because of their relative environmental stress.

AB  - Abstract The range of Agrionemys horsfieldii in Iran is outlined and known locality records are mapped, including seven new localities from northern and eastern Iran. New data on habitats and population densities in different landscapes are given. Population density varied between 0.7 and 2.15 ind./ha. An historical analysis of the habitat formation and divergence of the Horsfield tortoise on the Iranian Plateau is given. Information on morphology, ecology and parasitology of the populations from the environs of Mazdavand is presented. The morphometric characteristics of two populations were compared and some morphometric indices were found. The possible cooccurrence of Agrionemys horsfieldii and Testudo graeca zarudnyi is discussed. These two species show a preference for different conditions and rarely meet together in the same habitat.

AB  - The land of the “Cetatea Histria” Museum Complex, the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve, holds a large population of Testudo graeca, relatively well isolated due to the existing fence around the land of museum and the lack of suitable habitat in the vicinity. The relative high density of individuals in this area, 1.68 individuals / ha, and low recapture rates, 9.25%, suggests a large population size. The presence of juveniles and the lack of individuals with tick infestation or traces of human violence on carapace or plastron indicate a viable population which occupies an area with limited human activity. Resume. Le perimetre du Complexe Museal «Cetatea Histria», Reserve de la biosphere du Delta du Danube, est habite par une importante population de Testudo graeca relativement bien isolee en raison de la barriere existante et le manque d’habitat convenable a proximite. La forte densite relative des individus dans ce domaine et la recapture faible suggerent une grande population. La presence de nombreux juveniles et aucune infestation de tiques observees ou de violence humaine sur la carapace ou le plastron, montrent une reproduction de la population qui occupe une supericie ou l’activite humaine est limitee.

AB  - The world is facing a biodiversity crisis and populations of surviving species have substantially declined. This has led to small and fragmented wildlife populations that are then at greater risk of extinction from intrinsic population factors and chance events. Conservation translocations can counter and reverse some of these effects by demographically or genetically augmenting small wild populations or re‐establishing new ones. Zoos and aquariums are developing into conservation organizations, and have a suite of expertise and experience that can be applied to securing populations of threatened species through conservation translocations. The papers in this volume provide examples of this, and highlight some of the challenges and solutions associated with this area of conservation.

Nevertheless, in hatchlings, and to alesser extent, in juveniles the shell is soft and/ornot solid enough to resist to many predatorssuch as monitors, dogs, or birds for example(DouglasandWinegarner,1977;FitzpatrickandWoolfenden, 1978; Branch and Els, 1990; Gef-fen and Mendelssohn, 1997; Keller et al., 1998;Hill, 1999; Lagarde et al., 2001; Boarman,2002).

AB  - We studied the long-term response of a cohort of eight female Agassiz’s desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) during the first 15 years following a large fire at a wind energy generation facility near Palm Springs, California, USA. The fire burned a significant portion of the study site in 1995. Tortoise activity areas were mapped using minimum convex polygons for a proximate post-fire interval from 1997 to 2000, and a long-term post-fire interval from 2009 to 2010. In addition, we measured the annual reproductive output of eggs each year and monitored the body condition of tortoises over time. One adult female tortoise was killed by the fire and five tortoises bore exposure scars that were not fatal. Despite predictions that tortoises would make the short-distance movements from burned to nearby unburned habitats, most activity areas and their centroids remained in burned areas for the duration of the study. The percentage of activity area burned did not differ significantly between the two monitoring periods. Annual reproductive output and measures of body condition remained statistically similar throughout the monitoring period. Despite changes in plant composition, conditions at this site appeared to be suitable for survival of tortoises following a major fire. High productivity at the site may have buffered tortoises from the adverse impacts of fire if they were not killed outright. Tortoise populations at less productive desert sites may not have adequate resources to sustain normal activity areas, reproductive output, and body conditions following fire.

AB  - The overwhelming majority of animal conservation projects are focused on vertebrates, despite most of the species on Earth being invertebrates. Estimates state that about half of all named species of invertebrates are parasitic in at least one stage of their development. The dilemma of viewing parasites as biodiversity or pest has been discussed by several authors. However, ticks were omitted. The latest taxonomic synopses of non-fossil Ixodidae consider valid 700 species. Though, how many of them are still extant is almost impossible to tell, as many of them are known only from type specimens in museums and were never collected since their original description. Moreover, many hosts are endangered and as part of conservation efforts of threatened vertebrates, a common practice is the removal of, and treatment for external parasites, with devastating impact on tick populations. There are several known cases when the host became extinct with subsequent coextinction of their ectoparasites. For our synoptic approach we have used the IUCN status of the host in order to evaluate the status of specifically associated hard-ticks. As a result, we propose a number of 63 coendangered and one extinct hard-tick species. On the other side of the coin, the most important issue regarding tick-host associations is vectorial transmission of microbial pathogens (i.e. viruses, bacteria, protozoans). Tick-borne diseases of threatened vertebrates are sometimes fatal to their hosts. Mortality associated with pathogens acquired from ticks has been documented in several cases, mostly after translocations. Are ticks a real threat to their coendangered host and should they be eliminated? Up to date, there are no reliable proofs that ticks listed by us as coendangered are competent vectors for pathogens of endangered animals.

AB  - Dry rivers are a type of non-perennial river characterized by extreme dry conditions and dominance of terrestrial habitats. They are present in all continents, being especially abundant in arid and semiarid regions. Recent studies have shown their capacity to provide ecosystem services, although they are often undervalued and altered. This study is a literature review on the ecosystem services provided by dry rivers to human well-being. We apply the conceptual framework for the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. First, we describe and exemplify the services provided by the natural system and its biodiversity. Second, we present the contributions of the local social system to service provision through co-production processes. Finally, the main drivers of ecosystem change that alter service provision are listed and discussed. We found that dry rivers and their biodiversity contribute to local human well-being. The ecological knowledge and culture of local human communities acquired over generations contribute to service provision maintaining the socio-ecological system’s sustainability and its resilience to disturbances. Among drivers of change, those of a social-cultural (e.g., sedentarization) and economic (e.g., globalization) nature affect dry rivers’ capacity to provide ecosystem services the most. Reconciling people and dry rivers requires a great deal of research and education.

AB  - Background Recent reports have demonstrated the presence of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) genomic material in Hyalomma aegyptium ticks feeding primarily on tortoises belonging to the genus Testudo. This raises the question if these ticks and their hosts play a role in the natural transmission dynamics of CCHFV. However, the studies are limited, and assessing the relevance of H. aegyptium in perpetuating the virus in nature, and a potential spillover to humans remains unknown. This study aimed to detect CCHFV in H. aegyptium ticks and their tortoise hosts in the East Thrace region of Turkey, where H. aegyptium is the most common human-biting tick and where a high density of tortoises of the genus Testudo can be found. Methods During the study period, 21 blood samples from different tortoises (2 T. hermanni and 19 T. graeca), 106 tick pools (containing 448 males, 152 females, 93 nymphs and 60 larvae) collected from 65 tortoises (5 T. hermanni and 60 T. graeca), 38 adult unfed questing ticks (25 males and 13 females, screened individually) and 14 pools (containing 8 nymphs and 266 larvae) of immature unfed questing ticks collected from the ground were screened for CCHFV genome by nested PCR and partial genomes sequenced. Results As a result of the screening of these 179 samples, 17 (9.5%) were detected as positive as follows: 2 of 21 blood samples (9.52%), 13 (containing 18 nymphs in 3 pools, and 52 males and 8 females in 10 pools) of 106 tick pools from tortoises (12.26%), and 2 of 38 adult questing ticks (5.26%). No positive result was determined in 14 pools of immature questing ticks. Conclusions Previous studies have shown that reptiles can participate in the transmission of arthropod-borne viruses, but they may contribute to different aspects of the disease ecology and evolution of tick-borne viral pathogens. Our results indicate the presence of CCHFV in questing and feeding H. aegyptium ticks as well as tortoise hosts. This may indicate that CCHFV circulates in a cryptic transmission cycle in addition to the primary transmission cycle that could play a role in the natural dynamic of the virus and the transmission to humans.

AB  - Abstract We examined a total of 29 specimens of the Mediterranean Spur-thighed Tortoise, Testudo graeca, from two localities in the Aegean region and southeastern Turkey: 7♂ and 9♀ from Izmir and 4♂ and 9♀ from Adiyaman. An analysis of variance based on 31 morphometric ratios revealed significant differences (p<0.05) in the ratios of straight carapace length/femoral suture length, straight carapace length/plastron width 2, plastron length/plastron width 2, carapace width/carapace height, carapace width/gular suture length, carapace width/femoral suture length, nuchal length/nuchal width, and carapace width/plastron width 2. Both populations can be characterized by those parameters. The colour and pattern were inconsistent in both populations, but black is generally dominant in the Aegean population, whereas the prevailing colour in the southeastern population is yellow.

AB  - An epidemic of chronic rhinitis in a population of 50 captive spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca graeca) from Palafrugell (Girona, Spain) is described, in which eight animals died and 12 were euthanatized to perform necropsies and post-mortem studies. The main clinical sign was a bilateral, seromucous rhinitis often accompanied by stomatitis and glossitis. Hematology and serum biochemistry were performed in 33 of the 50 ill animals and in 29 healthy tortoises from three disease-free populations. Lymphocyte count, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity, and α-globulin levels were significantly higher in the animals from the sick population. The heterophil count was significantly lower in the sick animals. Some of the diseased tortoises also showed a normocytic-normochromic anemia. Lesions were restricted to the respiratory system and oral cavity. Marked epithelial hyperplasia and presence of a severe mixed inflammatory infiltrate in the epithelium of the oral, nasal, and tracheal mucosae were observ...

AB  - Traditional and local ecological knowledge (TEK/LEK) are important sources of information for wildlife conservation. However, there are often limitations and biases in the TEK/LEK methods used. In this study, we examined and implemented strategies to address the limitations and biases we identified while analyzing the mapped observations collected from 27 interviews as part of a larger project on walruses in Nunavik (Canadian Arctic). Our main objectives were to: (1) examine the importance of recording participants’ temporal and spatial limits of observations; (2) identify the factors influencing the quantity and diversity of mapped observations; (3) study the importance of documenting approximate numbers of animals observed; (4) examine the importance of gathering and presenting data at consistent and standardized spatial scales. We found that by adding to maps the geographic limits of participants’ common areas of observations, we were able to distinguish areas that hunters typically visited and did not see walruses, from areas that hunters never visited. Furthermore, we showed that the variability in the quantity of mapped observations was explained by the community of residence and average number of hunting trips per participant, but not by participant age. Finally, although careful adjustments and standardization would be needed, we showed that by having an estimate of the number of walruses observed per area drawn, it would be possible to estimate mean local abundances of walruses. We hope this careful examination of TEK/LEK methods will help to increase confidence in these datasets as a valuable source of knowledge for wildlife conservation.

AB  - Chelonid herpesvirus (ChHV) and mycoplasmal infections cause similar clinical signs in terrestrial tortoises and may be the most important causative agents of rhinitis- stomatitis complex, a common disease in captive tortoises worldwide. Currently, diagno- sis of ChHV and Mycoplasma spp. infections is most often based on serologic testing. However, serologic results only detect past exposure, and the specificity of these tests can be reduced due to antigenic cross-reactions with other patho- gens. Molecular-based techniques could help to define the causative agent and to better manage infected tortoises. Using polymerase chain reaction, we analyzed 63 tortoises (59 spur-thighed tortoise, Testudo graeca; three Greek tortoise, Testudo ibera; and one Russian tortoise, Agryonemys horsfieldii) with clinical signs of rhinitis-stomatitis complex to identify the causative agent. Molecular evidence of ChHV type I (24%), type II (3%), and Mycoplasma agassizii (6%) infections, as well as coinfection of Mycoplasma-ChHV and both types of ChHV, were detected. Both ChHV and M. agassizii are considered pathogenic in captive tortoises and both are a threat to wild populations. However, neither agent was de- tected from most of the symptomatic tortoises we evaluated, indicating that other agents could be involved in the rhinitis-stomatitis complex.

AB  - In the present work we analyzed the genetic structure of the populations of the terrestrial tortoise Testudo graeca graeca in southeastern Spain, identified as a recent range expansion from North Africa. The study and interpretation of the species' genetic spatial pattern could provide clues to the processes related to the species' arrival and, because of its endangered status, is especially useful in implementing appropriate management measures. We used microsatellite markers to analyze 17 populations located in the coastal region of the species' range in southeastern Spain, and an external group of Algerian tortoises. Three genetic units with a high level of spatial coherence and moderate levels of admixture resulted from a cluster analysis, and an isolation-by-distance pattern covering the entire study area was detected. These results suggest that southeastern Spanish populations show a complex spatial genetic pattern resulting from their isolation from North African populations and their natural dispersal in this region. Finally, our work shows that conservation actions such as captive breeding, introductions or translocations, may have played a relevant role in the modification of the genetic structure of some populations in southeastern Spain. Therefore, these types of conservation measures should be carried out with more caution.

AB  - Our compilation of zooarchaeological data from a series of important archaeological sites spanning the Epipaleolithic through Pre-Pottery Neolithic B periods in the Mediterranean Hills of the southern Levant contributes to major debates about the beginnings of ungulate management in Southwest Asia. The data support an onset of ungulate management practices by the Early PPNB (10,500-10,000 cal. BP), more than 500 years earlier than previously thought for this region. There is a clear developmental connection between reduced hunting intensity and the uptake of ungulate management, confirming that this process began in response to local, density-dependent demographic factors. The early process of goat domestication in the southern Levant appears to have been overwhelmingly local. This may have been true for cattle and pigs as well. Nevertheless, the loose synchrony of animal management trends across Southwest Asia was undoubtedly enabled by large-scale social networks that transmitted knowledge. The results add to growing evidence that animal management processes followed multiple regional evolutionary pathways within the Fertile Crescent.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry has been proposed as a useful noninvasive tool for detecting the influence of the environment on body development. In the present study, we used digital images to estimate the fluctuating asymmetry of the plastron in an isolated Testudo graeca population in Dobrogea, Romania. We extracted data from the photos regarding the area, height, and width of 3 plastron scutes. A total of 155 adult tortoises analysed showed reduced variation in plastron asymmetry and no significant relationship was detected between fluctuating asymmetry and sex or body size. We suggest that fluctuating asymmetry may be an individual trait, with no predictive value at the population level.

AB  - The trading and collection of wild animals as pets may be cause for concern regarding animal welfare and species conservation. These concerns can be exemplified by Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca), a long-living species whose use as pets is long established. The human dimension plays a major role in the wildlife for the pet collection, and is particularly important in countries like Morocco, where this might pose a threat to the conservation of the species involved. This study, which is based on a questionnaire survey (n = 480 participants), documents the fact that many people in Morocco keep tortoises as pets: 55% of the participants in the survey and over two tortoises/person. Importantly, most captive tortoises, particularly juveniles, had been collected directly from wild populations by their owners (42%, n = 264). In general, the tortoise owners had limited knowledge of their tortoises’ habits and requirements, although rural people were more likely to acknowledge that the tortoise is a wild and threatened species. Our study reveals that non-commercial collection is a common activity in Morocco that may threaten wild tortoise populations and hence species conservation, and it could have consequences regarding the welfare of the animals. We were also able to identify the profile of people towards whom education campaigns should be directed in order to reduce the number of tortoises collected from wild populations. Additional field research should also be conducted to quantify the impact of pet collection on wild tortoise populations.

AB  - Until the late 1970s spur-thighed tortoises Testudo graeca , endemic to the Mediterranean region, were exported from range countries in large volumes for the pet trade. Testudo graeca was included on CITES Appendix II in 1975, and in 1978 Morocco introduced national protection, banning domestic and international trade. However, the species is still openly traded in Moroccan markets. In 2013-2014 we conducted 48 surveys in 20 Moroccan towns and cities and single surveys in two Spanish exclaves to assess trade levels, size-composition, turnover, and variation between cities. We recorded 3267 T. graeca in 107 shops in 12 cities. Of 989 tortoises measured, two-thirds measured <10 cm (∼2-8 years of age) and <3% could comprise first-year individuals. There is a clear relationship between price and size, with ‘average’ tortoises costing USD 9.20. The largest volumes were observed in Tangier (869) and Rabat (752), two cities that are well-connected centres of export. The largest proportion of shops selling tortoises was in Agadir (78%) and Fez (63%), and turnover was highest in Tangier (32/week) and Casablanca (28/week). Country-wide turnover was ∼30% after two weeks and ∼80% after 10 weeks. Annual turnover was estimated at 3500-7000 tortoises, with a monetary value of USD 30 000-60 000. Predictors for volumes of trade and proportion of shops selling tortoises are: the number of wildlife shops in markets, diversity of wild vertebrate species the shops have on offer, and city population. While legal, large-scale international trade of spur-thighed tortoises from Morocco has diminished over the last decades, domestic smaller-scale trade continues to impede their conservation. Consistent punitive measures are required to enforce new laws.

AB  - <jats:p>Due to phenotypic plasticity and sex-biased selective pressures, intraspecific variation in tortoise morphology is usually assessed by studying sexual dimorphism. However, inferences may differ based on the choice of shell size measurements for analyses. In this work, we identified linear measurements that best describe sexual dimorphism for the spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca whitei. We assessed 34 carapace and plastron measurements in 67 individuals (24 males, 43 females) in a population at the natural Mergueb site located on the central limit of the Algerian steppe. Twenty-two out of 34 measurements significantly showed sexual size dimorphism in ANOVA tests. When analyzing sexual shape dimorphism with ANCOVAs, nine measurements showed no shared allometry with the measurements used as covariates to correct by size. Meanwhile, 17 out of the remaining 23 measurements showed significant differences in shape. PCA analyses similarly described T. graeca’s sexual dimorphism. In general, females tend to be bigger than males, especially in central scutes what is probably linked with clutch sizes commitments. On the other hand, males are larger-sized in anterior and posterior scutes, probably as a result of courtship, male fighting and copulation. Some of the analyzed measurements are revealed as being especially adequate for further studying the geographical variation of sexual dimorphism in Testudo graeca</jats:p>

AB  - Concurrent surveys of the mortality of tortoises, after purchase from pet shops, were undertaken during the periods May 1982 to May 1986 and May 1983 to May 1986. The first survey involved 499 Testudo graeca ibera and the second 106 Testudo hermanni hermanni. By the end of the survey periods 91·8% of the T. graeca were dead and 86·8% of the T. hermanni. A yearly mortality rate of between 23% and 29% is much greater than would be expected in a stable wild population. Problems associated with hibernation accounted for 84·5% of deaths. On the basis of this survey the mass importation of tortoises, into the United Kingdom, cannot be justified.

AB  - Bird nest selection in forests can be influenced by the composition of key structural elements and resources. This has important consequences in terms of species population dynamics since it can determine reproduction success. Here, we assessed Common raven nest-site selection and reproductive success, and how these might be determined by foraging behavior and habitat structure. A previously documented breeding raven population that exerts high predation pressure on young Spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) in a Mediterranean forest was monitored. Generalized linear mixed models were performed to determine the singularities of the trees with nests and the drivers of reproductive success of breeding pairs of ravens. The results showed a high density of breeding pairs in the study area (0.8 pairs/km2), which selected taller trees in areas with higher bare ground cover and a high density of tortoises for nesting. Nests were spatially aggregated; breeding pairs occupied smaller territories and intraspecific competition seemed relaxed, reflecting the abundance of food resources. Most breeding pairs occasionally predated on young tortoises. Tortoises seem to play a part in raven reproductive success in our study area, which might be associated with the availability/catchability of young tortoises. The study illustrates that Spur-thighed tortoise distribution and abundance plays a role in the breeding behavior of ravens and is mediated by habitat structure. Understanding the drivers of nest-site selection and the breeding behavior of ravens is pivotal to implementing appropriate habitat management and conservation strategies across their distribution range, particularly in areas where ravens potentially affect threatened species.

AB  - AT the meeting of the Convocation of the University of London on Tuesday, the University was saved from committing an act detrimental to its best interests. The report of the annual committee condemning the recommendations of the Gresham Commissioners as to the reconstruction of the University was under consideration. It was urged by the supporters of the report that the rapidly increasing number of candidates who present themselves for the University examinations, was a sufficient argument against any change of constitution. We agree with Dr. Hart, that the University has raised the standard of education, that it has encouraged the aspirations of persons unable to bear the expense of residence in University towns, and that it has done much for the higher education of women. But the time has arrived when the University must become more than a mere examining body, if it wishes to keep pace with the times. Members of Convocation who are jealous of the prerogative position at present occupied should look around, and then ask themselves whether London ought not to have a teaching University like those of other capitals in Europe. A mistaken idea as to the dignity of the University should not be allowed to stand in the way of the proposed developments. It would be far more dignified to accept the changes, unless, indeed, the University of London desires to find itself eclipsed by another with a charter more suited to the requirements of to-day. Some of the most eminent members of Convocation recognise the necessity of the old order giving place to the new. Prof. Sylvanus Thompson pointed out that when functions were, as in the case of London University, extremely limited, they should be extended. “Why should not,” he said, “the University perform all those great duties of encouraging research and learning and of teaching, which were an essential part of a true University. He hoped the matter would be approached in a temperate spirit, and that they would not stand on a mistaken notion of their dignity. There might be blots on the scheme which they should seek to remove, but was it wise to oppose the scheme in a thoroughly hostile spirit? Let them beware of showing such a spirit, for it might be that a new University would arise, discharging all the functions of a University, and the present University of London might be left in the cold. The substitution of a new charter for an old did not, as they knew from past experience, impair the continuity of their existence. It would be a great pity if two Universities should arise—one not called by the name of the capital, but doing all the work of a University, whilst that which was called the University of London was restricted to the narrow sphere of examinations.” Mr. Thiselton Dyer also supported the recommendations of the Royal Commissioners, rightly remarking that the scheme would enable the University to develop its full powers, especially in the department of post-graduate study, in which lies the true glory of a University. The resolution of the annual committee, protesting against the withdrawal of the present charter, was eventually set aside by an almost unanimous vote. This is satisfactory as far as it goes, but it does not dispose of the matter in a very effective manner. A motion was afterwards proposed by Sir Albert Rollit, in the following form:—“That, with a view to the speedy and satisfactory reconstitution of the University, it is desirable to secure, if possible, the co-operation of the Senate and Convocation, and with this object Convocation refers the whole question of the reconstitution of the University to the annual committee, with power to nominate members of a joint consultative committee of the Senate and Convocation.” This was unanimously adopted; so the University is once more given the chance of reconsidering its policy, and of gracefully accepting the proposed changes before they are forced upon it.

AB  - We searched for patterns in the local abundance of Testudo graeca graeca with respect to relief characteristics in south-east Spain. The detection of tortoises during linear transects, in sampling plots and through fortuitous observations was used to examine distribution in relation to aspect and to topographic position at two different local scales. Both aspect and run-off gradients produced spatial patterns in the local abundance of T. g. graeca. These patterns are discussed with regard to the key conditions and resources for the species (solar radiation, food and nesting sites). At both scales tortoises were more abundant on north-west facing slopes, where solar radiation levels are assumed to be moderate to high, and where there are probably plenty of food resources. The apparent avoidance of north-east facing slopes, despite an abundance of food, suggests that tortoises may not be able to thermoregulate adequately in these areas and that thermoregulation may be the most important requirement for the species. Valley bottoms, mainly occupied by non-irrigated crops, were also selected. Therefore, our results suggest that there is a spatially aggregated population structure at a local scale that is caused by factors associated with relief.

AB  - Two types of pathogens cause highly contagious upper respiratory tract diseases (URTD) in Chelonians: testudinid herpesviruses (TeHV) and a mycoplasma (Mycoplasma agassizii). In captivity, these infections are frequent and can provoke outbreaks. Pet trade generates an international flow of tortoises, often without sanitary checking; individuals intentionally or accidentally released in the wild may spread pathogens. A better understanding of the transmission of infectious agents from captivity to wild tortoises is needed. Many exotic individuals have been introduced in populations of the endangered western Hermanns tortoise (Testudo hermanni hermanni), notably spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca). We assessed the presence of TeHV and mycoplasma in native western Hermanns tortoises and in potential pet vectors in south-eastern France. Using a large sample (N=572 tortoises), this study revealed, by PCR, the worrying presence of herpesvirus in 7 free-ranging individuals (3 sub-populations). Additionally, Mycoplasma agassizii was detected, by PCR, in 15 of the 18 populations sampled with a frequency ranging from 3.4% (1 of 29 tortoises) to 25% (3 of 12 tortoises). Exotic spur-thighed tortoises showed a high frequency of mycoplasma infection in captivity (18.2%) and in individuals (50%) found in native Hermanns tortoise sub-populations, suggesting that this species could be a significant vector. The paucity of information of TeHV on European tortoise URTD in natural settings, especially in combination with mycoplasma, prompts further studies. Indeed, sick tortoises remain concealed and may not be easily detected in the field. Our results indicate good health for most infected tortoises but they should be screened in the field as well as in captivity.

AB  - We present 10 nearly complete mitochondrial genomes of the extinct tortoise Chelonoidis alburyorum from the Bahamas. While our samples represent morphologically distinct populations from six islands, their genetic divergences were shallow and resembled those among Galapagos tortoises. Our molecular clock estimates revealed that divergence among Bahamian tortoises began ~ 1.5 mya, whereas divergence among the Galapagos tortoises (C. niger complex) began ~ 2 mya. The inter-island divergences of tortoises from within the Bahamas and within the Galapagos Islands are much younger (0.09–0.59 mya, and 0.08–1.43 mya, respectively) than the genetic differentiation between any other congeneric pair of tortoise species. The shallow mitochondrial divergences of the two radiations on the Bahamas and the Galapagos Islands suggest that each archipelago sustained only one species of tortoise, and that the taxa currently regarded as distinct species in the Galapagos should be returned to subspecies status. The extinct tortoises from the Bahamas have two well-supported clades: the first includes one sample from Great Abaco and two from Crooked Island; the second clade includes tortoises from Great Abaco, Eleuthera, Crooked Island, Mayaguana, Middle Caicos, and Grand Turk. Tortoises belonging to both clades on Great Abaco and Crooked Island suggest late Holocene inter-island transport by prehistoric humans.

AB  - Abstract
The tracheal epithelium of Testudo graeca and Pseudemys scripta elegans was studied by means of light and electron microscopy, histochemistry and immunocytochemistry. Three cell types were detected by conventional light microscopy: mucous, ciliated and basal. The Grimelius silver argyrophil technique was positive in a population of tracheal cells. By immunocytochemistry, serotonin-containing cells were identified. The mucous cells of Testudo graeca contained sialomucins and sulphomucins; however, only sialomucins were detected in Pseudemys scripta elegans. By electron microscopy four cell types were observed: mucous, ciliated, basal and endocrine. Plasma cells were also found. The differences between the species studied lay mainly in the ultrastructure of the ciliated cells, the mucous granules and the presence of a special type of basal cell called 'clear basal cells' in non-hibernating specimens of Testudo graeca. During hibernation, the tracheal epithelium of Testudo graeca showed the following changes: (1) Myelin bodies were present in the cytoplasm. (2) The intercellular spaces were remarkably widened. (3) No 'clear basal cells' were present. In conclusion, the tracheal epithelium of the reptiles studied showed a pattern similar to that described in mammals but some differences from reptiles previously studied were found.

AB  - Accurate information on density, structure and vulnerability of wild populations occupies a central place in conservation biology. A mark-recapture study was carried out during the 2003 activity season in a population of Testudo graeca in the Central Jbilets (Morocco). Juveniles were poorly represented in our data set, suggesting that juvenile numbers are actually low in our population and/or that tortoises are easier to capture after the behavioural shift of the acquisition of sexual maturity. Although the studied population was localised in a severely over- grazed area, the estimated adult and sub-adult population density, six individu- als/ha, was relatively high comparatively to available estimates in other places. However, within three months of fieldwork, it was possible to capture most of the adults (60%), suggesting that Testudo graeca graeca populations are very sensitive to illegal and repeated harvesting. Long-term monitoring of the population is re- quired to better appreciate the demographic trend of this population.

AB  - The use of local ecological knowledge (LEK) has been advocated for biodiversity monitoring and management. To date, however, it has been underused in studying wild populations of animals and, particularly, in obtaining quantitative abundance estimates. We evaluated LEK as a tool for collecting extensive data on local animal abundance and population trends. We interviewed shepherds in southeastern Spain, asking them to estimate the local abundance of the terrestrial tortoise Testudo graeca. We quantified reliability of abundance estimates derived from interviews by comparing them with those obtained from standard field-sampling protocols (distance sampling). We also explored the complementarity of these 2 approaches. LEK provided high-quality and low-cost information about both distribution and abundance of T. graeca. Interviews with shepherds yielded abundance estimates in a much wider range than linear transects, which only detected the species in the upper two-thirds of its abundance range. Abundance estimates from both methodologies showed a close relationship. Analysis of confidence intervals indicated local knowledge could be used to estimate mean local abundances and to detect mean population trends. A cost analysis determined that the information derived from LEK was 100 times cheaper than that obtained through linear-transect surveys. Our results should further the use of LEK as a standard tool for sampling the quantitative abundance of a great variety of taxa, particularly when population densities are low and traditional sampling methods are expensive or difficult to implement.

AB  - AbstractThe spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca has a wide distribution encompassing southern Europe and the Middle East through to northern Africa. The populations at the northern limit of T. graeca’s range in the province of Dobrogea (Romania) are sparsely distributed across the entire area, with higher densities found in the hilly forested areas. Although strictly protected, the spur-thighed tortoise was and continues to be impacted by human activities. This study investigated the presence and characteristics of scars from past injuries on their shells. We studied three populations from protected areas, situated along a north–south gradient of approximately 150 km: Macin Mountains National Park (northernmost limit of T. graeca’s range), Cetatea Histria, located within the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve, in the central part of the region, and the Dumbraveni Forest Natural Reserve in the south. All three populations had individuals with scars from past injuries on their shells. The highest numbers of in...

Over recent decades, human activities (e.g. rural abandonment, monoculture plantations) and global warming are magnifying the risk of fire, with changes in fire intensity and frequency. Here, we offer the first study that examines the impact of fire on the spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca living in a native cork oak forest and pine plantation in north-western Africa. A total of 44 transects (22 burnt and 22 unburnt) were sampled at 8 sites affected by fires of natural cork oak forest and pine plantation with 8 surveys per site in 2015–2017 (264 hours of sampling effort). Tortoise densities were estimated with line-transect distance sampling. The detection probability of tortoises was higher in burnt (0.915) than unburnt (0.474) transects. The density of tortoises was negatively associated with elevation and declined with fire by c. 50% in both forest types. The negative response of T. graeca to fire should be considered in conservation planning of this species in north-western Africa in a future scenario of changes in fire regime.

AB  - Rhinitis is a common condition of captive Mediterranean tortoises (Testudo species). The interpretation of the results of the bacteriological examination of naso-oropharyngeal swabs from affected individuals has proved difficult, because the normal bacterial population of this region was unknown. No substantial differences in the strains of bacteria isolated from healthy individuals and from those affected by rhinitis could be found in this study. The report that Sendai virus was implicated in the genesis of rhinitis in tortoises could not be substantiated. Paired blood samples failed to show a rise in titres against Sendai virus in either study group.

AB  - In 1969 an investigation supported by the FPS/WWF Revolving Fund established that there had been wholesale collecting of tortoises Testudo graeca throughout Morocco. The three exporting dealers reported that tortoises were very sparse in the Casablanca region, their exporting centre; only in the Oued Souss valley of south-west Morocco were they to be found in any numbers. The total Moroccan population in 1969 was estimated to be about five million, occupying an area of approximately 162,000 sq km at a mean density of around 30 per sq km. Because so few were found (only 23), comparisons in abundance between different regions were made only in relative terms; the effects of bulk trade collection on population size and structure could not be pinpointed. Routine size/weight measurements were made in relation to age, sex and maturity; air temperature measurements were recorded in relation to activity and time of year.

AB  - Abstract Morphological variation among a population of Testudo graeca from two neighbouring sites of the Nemrut Volcano has been analysed, and six morphometric characters have been assessed in 305 specimens, mainly adults. This population shows remarkable morphometric differences. Macrohabitat differences among sites have been involved to explain this variability in the light of the huge morphological plasticity of this wide-ranging taxon.

AB  - Abstract The global trade in tortoises of the genus Testudo was reviewed by using compiled import data from Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) for 1975–2005. A total of 58 importing and 112 exporting countries were recorded as being involved with the Testudo trade. Turkey, the former Soviet Union, the former Yugoslavia, Morocco, Uzbekistan, Russia, and Ukraine accounted for 81% of the recorded exports; whereas, the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States dominated the import market with 67% of the individuals. Testudo horsfieldi accounted for 48% of the exports, followed by Testudo graeca (37%) and Testudo hermanni (13%). A total of 2,062,289 individuals were traded internationally, and of these, 99% were live animals. Of the animals from known sources, 67% were from the wild, and 16% were allegedly captive bred; the source of 70% of all declared trade animals was unknown.

AB  - ABSTRACT The growth dynamics of Testudo graeca L. in the Iberian Peninsula were studied, taking into account weight and length of carapace, using embryos and both male and female, immature and adult specimens. The results suggest that weight is a strongly allometric parameter in relation to carapace length. The growth factors of these reptiles are discussed and compared with those of other populations of circum-Mediterranean Testudinidae.

          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Male L. ocellata individuals (n = 75) collected from the territory of two provinces (Lampang and Tak) in northern Thailand exhibited annual variation in sex hormonal, histomorphometric, and histochemical characteristics of the male reproductive system. The reproductive cycle was subdivided into eight reproductive periods (early first active, first active, resting, second recrudescent, second active, regressive, quiescent, and first recrudescent), thus displaying a bimodal pattern with two actively reproductive periods. Circulating sex hormones (testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone) peaked in the first active (February) and the second active (June-July) periods. Likewise, gonadosomatic index (GSI) and histomorphometric variables of the testes and of the genital ducts (rete testis, ductuli efferentes, ductus epididymis, and ductus deferens) revealed their highest values in the first active period. Marked increase in protein and carbohydrate production was detectable in the ductuli efferentes during the active periods.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The male reproductive cycle of L. ocellata showed a biannual pattern of the hormonal profile, and detailed histomorphometric and histochemical characteristics of the entire reproductive system. Hence, the present study provides improved basic knowledge on the reptilian reproductive biology with comparative viewpoints to other reptiles.</AbstractText>

Une population a ete etudiee de la mi Avril a la fin Mai 2010 au niveau des steppes d’Aflou. L’objectif de cette etude est l’identification et la quantification de la charge parasitaire en tiques. Ainsi, que l’examen des frottis sanguin afin d’identifier les hemoparasites. Hyalomma aegyptium s'est avere la seule espece de tiques qui parasite notre population de tortue avec presque le meme degre pour les mâles et les femelles. La prevalence totale d’ Hyalomma est de 59.71 % d’un nombre global de 105 tiques collectees. L’intensite moyenne totale est de l’ordre de 2.83 ; plus importante chez les femelles que chez les males avec des valeurs respectives de 3.72 et 2.57 et beaucoup plus faible chez les juveniles avec une valeur de 1.00. L’abondance egalement est tres faible dans la population etudiee, avec une valeur de 1.69 seulement. Il n’existe aucune correlation entre la charge parasitaire et les parametres morphologiques ou physiologiques des tortues. En effet, la partie anterieure de la tortue est la plus parasite avec un taux de 77,69%.

AB  - Morphometric measurements, ratios and body condition indices of Testudo graeca populations distributed in Thrace Region (Çanakkale, Tekirdağ, Kırklareli, Edirne) were examined in order to compare morphological differences in both intra-population and inter-population. Morphological measurements were taken from a total of 133 adult tortoises (66 ♂♂, 67 ♀♀). Statistically significant differences were found when all morphometric measurements of male and female individuals within the populations were compared, and it was found that females were larger. In addition, statistically significant differences were found between male and female individuals when four populations compared between populations, and it was found that largest individuals were in Kırklareli population, and smallest individuals were in Edirne population. When all populations were examined, it was determined that all populations showed female-biased sexual dimorphism. With this study, Body Condition Index data of Testudo graeca populations were revealed for the first time.

AB  - Ticks carry a diverse community of microorganisms including non-pathogenic symbionts, commensals, and pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, protozoans, and fungi. The assessment of tick-borne microorganisms (TBM) in tortoises and their ticks is essential to understand their eco-epidemiology, and to map and monitor potential pathogens to humans and other animals. The aim of this study was to characterize the diversity of microorganisms found in ticks collected from the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) in North Africa and Anatolia. Ticks feeding on wild T. graeca were collected, and pathogens were screened by polymerase chain reaction using group-specific primers. In total, 131 adult Hyalomma aegyptium ticks were collected from 92 T. graeca in Morocco (n = 48), Tunisia (n = 2), Algeria (n = 70), and Turkey (n = 11). Bacteria and protozoa detected included Hemolivia mauritanica (22.9%), Midichloria mitochondrii (11.4%), relapsing-fever borreliae (8.4%), Ehrlichia spp. (7.6%), Rickettsia spp. (3.4%), Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. (0.9%), Francisella spp. (0.9%), and Wolbachia spp. (0.8%). The characterization of Rickettsia included R. sibirica mongolitimonae (Algeria), R. aeschlimannii (Turkey), and R.africae (Morocco). Hemolivia mauritanica and Ehrlichia spp. prevalence varied significantly with the sampling region/country. We did not detect significant associations in microorganism presence within ticks, nor between microorganism presence and tick mitochondrial DNA haplogroups. This is the first report of Francisella persica-like, relapsing fever borreliae, M. mitochondrii, and Wolbachia spp. in H. aegyptium ticks collected from wild hosts from the South and Eastern Mediterranean region, and of R. sibirica mongolitimonae and R. africae in H. aegyptium from Algeria and Morocco, respectively. Given that T. graeca is a common species in commercial and non-commercial pet trade, the evaluation of the role of this species and its ticks as hosts for TBM is particularly relevant for public health.

AB  - Chelonians are among the animal groups with the poorest conservation status. Since tortoises are long-lived species that need very long time to reach sexual maturity, they are extremely vulnerable to human pressure. Despite their endangered status, there are no common strategies for the development of conservation actions. At the “Mediterranean workshop to develop tortoise conservation strategies”, scientists, conservation associations, environmental managers, IUCN advisers and CITES inspectors met in October 2019 in Alicante (Spain). The aims were to update the diagnosis of the conservation status of the Hermann’s tortoise (Testudo hermanni) and the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) and to suggest strategies that guarantee their preservation at the Mediterranean Region. The main conclusions are summarized by:
i) Mediterranean tortoises are wild endangered species that must be protected in, and together with, their natural habitat. Their main threats are habitat loss and fragmentation and pet trade, but we should also pay attention to wildfires, spread of diseases, the introduction of exotic species or lineages and climate change.
ii) Long-term efforts and stablished protocols are needed to accurately diagnose and monitor the conservation status of wild populations, as well as flows among captive and wild animals.
iii)  Tortoise trade should be banned because it threatens the conservation of wild populations of tortoises. Illegal practices related to tortoises should be decidedly persecuted. People should consider tortoises as wild animals that are endangered and deserving of protection. It is possible to enjoy them by responsibly observing them in their habitat.
iv) Tortoises may carry pathogens or parasites and their sanitary status cannot be fully assessed. They should always be considered potential vectors of tortoise diseases and of zoonosis. Hygiene protocols should be implemented when managing them.
v) The researchers attending this workshop aimed to develop a scientific network for the long-term monitoring of graeca and T. hermanni populations in the Mediterranean Region. They will need the support from public administrations.

AB  - The species and subspecies of W Palaearctic tortoises include six, which are widespread in southern Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, and four with restricted ranges in the Mediterranean region. The Central Asian Testudo (Agrionemys) horsfieldii GRAY overlaps with Testudo graeca zarudnyiNIKOLSKY in Iran and Afghanistan. The distributions of the remainder border the Mediterranean Sea. Their survival is threatened directly or indirectly by human activity over many years and include habitat destruction (urbanization, touristic development, road-building, scrubland fires and agriculture), bulk pet and food trade collection for export to NW Europe (Testudo graeca graeca L., Testudo graeca ibera PAL-LAS, Testudo hermanni hermanni GMELIN, T. (A.) horsfieldii and sometimes Testudo marginata SCHOEPFF), isolation of populations with restricted ranges (Testudo hermanni robertmertensiWERMUTH, Testudo (Pseudotestudo) kleinmanni LORTET, T. marginata and Testudo graeca floweri BODENHEIMER), and desertification, especially in the Saharan encroachment zone of northern Africa from wood burning, animal grazing and rainfall decrease (T. g. graeca and T. (P.) kleinmanni). A circum-Mediterranean investigation would establish the population status of all species and their habitats. Countries of the Council of Europe and European Economic Community by ratifying C.I.T.E.S. (Washington Convention 1973) have established the extent of the bulk trade. This should only be allowed in captive-bred animals which, like other domestic pets, could be commercially farmed, probably by necessity in the Mediterranean bioclimatic zone.

AB  - Abstract A total of 79 species of local vertebrates (birds, mammals, and reptiles) are found to be in illegal trade in the West Bank, Palestine, during 2013–2020. Data were collected from visits to the animal markets in the main cities of the West Bank (Bethlehem, Hebron, Jenin, Jericho, Nablus, Ramallah, and Salfit) and from advertisements in social media. Birds were the most traded animals represented in 59 species (74.7%), followed by 12 species of reptiles (15.2%) and eight species of mammals (10.1%). Nineteen species are listed under CITES appendices (17 birds and 2 mammals under appendixes II and III, respectively). As for the conservation status according to the IUCN Red List, two bird species (Streptopelia turtur and Serinus syriacus) and one reptile (Testudo graeca) are listed as VU, while two mammals (Hyaena hyaena and Gazella gazella) are listed as NT and EN, respectively. Based on the local status, three species of bird are considered critically endangered (Coturnix coturnix, Asio flammeus, and Aquila chrysaetos), one bird is endangered (Falco subbuteo), and two mammals (Hyaena hyaena and Gazella gazella) are considered endangered and vulnerable respectively. This study reveals the urgent need to control animal trade in the Palestinian Territories.

AB  - <jats:p>This study was carried out in order to identify the different parasites (ecto and mesoparasites) infesting the tortoise Testudo graeca graeca. For this, a population of 24 tortoises was studied from mid-March to May 2018, in the region of Aflou-Laghouat, within two sites: Djellel and Oued Sebgag. The turtles were captured at the time of their activity; sex, age, body weight, total length of the shell and body height were determined. A careful search for parasites has been carried out using various recommended techniques. A total of 126 Hyalomma aegyptium ticks were identified, with an overall prevalence of 71%, an average intensity of 7.4 and an abundance of 5 ticks per individual. The stool examination identified six mesoparasites, namely: Angusticaecum holopterum, Enterobius vermicularis, Strongylus sp, Nematodirus sp, Trichostrongylus sp, Fasciola hepatica. The sex of the host showed a significant influence on the parasitic infestation: the females were four times more infested than the males.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract Survival is a key parameter in species' management and conservation. Most methods for estimating survival require time series data, large sample sizes and, overall, costly monitoring efforts. Inverse modeling approaches can be less data hungry, however they are underused in conservation sciences. Here we present an inverse modeling approach for estimating relative survival rates of long-lived species that is mathematically straightforward and evaluate its performance under constraints common in conservation studies related to small sample sizes. Specifically, we (i) estimated the relative survival rates in a Testudo graeca population based on one-year monitoring, (ii) assessed the impact of sample size on the accuracy, and (iii) tested alternative hypotheses on the impact of fire on the survival rates. We then compared the results of our approach with capture-recapture (CRC) estimates based on long-term monitoring. Our approach (153 individuals within a single year) yielded estimates of survival rates overlapping those of CRC estimates (11 years of data and 1009 individuals) for adults and subadults, but not for juveniles. Simulation experiments showed that our method provides robust estimates if sample size is above 100 individuals. The best models describing the impact of fire on survival identified by our approach predicts a decrease in survival especially in hatchlings and juvenile individuals, similar to CRC estimates. Our work proves that inverse modeling can decrease the cost for estimating demographic rates, especially for long-lived species and as such, its use should be encouraged in conservation and management sciences.

AB  - The Eastern box turtle (Terrapene carolina carolina) is a primarily terrestrial chelonian distributed across the eastern US. It has been proposed as a biomonitor due to its longevity, small home range, and reliance on the environment to meet its metabolic needs. Plasma samples from 273 free-ranging box turtles from populations in Tennessee and Illinois in 2011 and 2012 were evaluated for presence of heavy metals and to characterize hematologic variables. Lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn), chromium (Cr), selenium (Se), and copper (Cu) were detected, while cadmium (Cd) and silver (Ag) were not. There were no differences in any metal detected among age class or sex. However, Cr and Pb were higher in turtles from Tennessee, while As, Zn, Se, and Cu were higher in turtles from Illinois. Seasonal differences in metal concentrations were observed for Cr, Zn, and As. Health of turtles was assessed using hematologic variables. Packed cell volume was positively correlated with Cu, Se, and Pb in Tennessee. Total solids, a measure of plasma proteins, in Tennessee turtles were positively correlated with Cu and Zn. White blood cell count, a measure of inflammation, in Tennessee turtles was negatively correlated with Cu and As, and positively correlated with Pb. Metals are a threat to human health and the health of an ecosystem, and the Eastern Box Turtle can serve as a monitor of these contaminants. Differences established in this study can serve as baseline for future studies of these or related populations.

AB  - Abstract Macroparasites in general, and ectoparasites in particular, have the potential to regulate host population dynamics. In this context, this study addresses the tick parasitism traits of the Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) in the core area of its distribution range (northwestern Morocco, Maamora). It was discovered that 92.5% of the tortoises were parasitized by ticks in spring, with an infestation intensity and an abundance of 6.7 and 6.2 tick/tortoise, respectively. The observed parasitization rates were among the highest reported worldwide for T. graeca, which could relate to density-depended effects driving host-parasite interactions. The main tick species that parasitized the tortoises were Hyalomma aegyptium (95.6% of the ticks and in the 100% of the parasitized tortoises), Hy. marginatum, Hy. excavatum and Hy. scupense. Individual predictors for the tortoises, such as age, sex and the interaction between body condition and sex, were significantly related to tick abundance. Age-related behavioural differences might favour a higher host-tick effective contact in adults than in juveniles. The fact that males are more active in spring - the breeding season - might explain the observed male-bias in tick abundance and may also be responsible for the negative effect of male body condition on tick infestation rate in contrast to females. Given the potential role played by parasites as regards modulating population dynamics, our results suggest that ticks should be taken into account in the conservation and management programmes of this tortoise species.

AB  - During a herpetological survey at the island of Kos, the authors observed Testudo graeca ibera . The portion of tortoises that show a divided supracaudal shield was analysed. This question is of interest because in the literature this is one of the so-called typical characters used to separate it from other European species Testudo hermanni (s.l.). From 115 specimens examined, 8 showed a divided supracaudal, thus 7 % in total. Furthermore significant differences exist between sites. In one place only 2 of 60 had this characteristic, but 5 of 24 at another site. Additionally the authors remark on unexpected differences in morphology (Marginalia) in one population.

AB  - Using data for the body size and shell shape of Algerian <i>Testudo graeca</i>, we assessed how proximate causes shaped the observed variation in the morphology of adults. All of the studied populations displayed significant sexual size and shape dimorphisms. Relative to body length, females displayed larger, more voluminous and domed shells than males. We found clear evidence that variation in body size at maturity influenced sexual size dimorphism. Body size at maturity depends on the duration of growth from hatching up to the point of reaching sexual maturity. In the studied populations, sexual maturity, estimated by counting growth lines, was always reached earlier in males than in females (a time difference of 1.4-3.0 years). Similar to sexual size dimorphism, geographic variation in adult body sizes was also influenced by variations in the corresponding sizes at maturity. Remarkably, the population with the largest tortoises had the latest mean maturation time: 9.1 for males and 10.5 for females. Thus, the later completion of maturation was a determinant for a larger size in adulthood. The largest tortoises among the studied populations were measured at the Djelfa locality, where the recorded sizes of males and females reached 186 and 230 mm, respectively.

AB  - Abstract We studied plastron-shaped asymmetry of the Eurasian Spur-Thighed Tortoise, Testudo graeca ibera, as related to life stage, gender, and distribution. Our analyses of 523 individuals showed that fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in plastron shape varied with gender (males exhibited higher levels of FA than did females) and across populations, whereas life stage had no significant effect. Although we could not identify the potential sources of variation responsible for the observed patterns of developmental instability, our study shows the value of FA as a method for studies of developmental instability in turtles.

AB  - <jats:p>Between February and September 2014, we performed a survey of 23 animal markets in Beirut. Trade in wild animals including reptiles, birds and mammals comprise a large volume (25704 specimens). The estimated value of wildlife trade in Lebanon in the visited shops and during the study period is 431371 US$, out of which 97 % is for birds. This number indicates the economical importance of wildlife trade in Lebanon. Due to the high demand by the public, birds constituted the majority of the traded species which consisted mostly of cage-bred or imported species. Lebanon’s biodiversity is not threatened by the trade of wild species, except for some species like the Spur-thighed tortoise. However, the risk of transmission of diseases due to trade in wildlife is evident. The prices of traded animals varied according to their conservational status, their origins (local, captive-bred, imported or smuggled), supply and demand, and specific features of species. Highest prices were observed when all factors are combined (i.e. case of the Macaw parrot). Most (64%) traded species are not listed under any appendix of CITES, only 16 species are listed under Appendix-II and one species is listed under Appendix-III. Regarding IUCN status of traded species, five species are considered vulnerable, one is endangered, one is near threatened and the rest are considered as least concern. Furthermore, most (70%) of the shops visited were in poor conditions, while shops in excellent conditions are exclusively the licensed shops. Hence, law enforcement and regulation of wildlife trade will have a positive impact on not only shop conditions, but also on animals well being, reduced degree of mortality in trade, reduced smuggling, and consequently a better conservation of wildlife in Lebanon.</jats:p>

AB  - A small population of Testudo hermanni boettgeri Mojsisovics, 1889, was discovered and studied in detail in the easternmost part of the Balkan Mountain Range - Eminska Mountain. 57 Testudo hermanni GMelin, 1789, with adult sex ratio males/females of 1.52 were marked and described. Only one male specimen of Testudo graeca ibera Pallas, 1814, was found and marked. The age structure was skewed, low juvenile/ female ratio - 0.19 pointed at an alarming decline of population density. Detailed, continuous observa- tions over the seasonal and daily activity level, territorial and courtship behaviour were conducted in the field and within the enclosed protected 2000 sq. m area. Seven adult females, 3 males and 12 hatchlings were the object of detailed observations in the enclosed protected area. The actual nest excavation and the egg laying process were precisely described, along with some unusual behaviour, the preferred time for nesting was assumedly established. Monitoring of temperatures during incubation period of a natural nest was carried out and the results were compared with the ones measured in an artificial incubator environ - ment. Detailed description of the hatchlings and their development and growth rate during the first 90 days was made.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Cutaneous lesions were observed in a wild population of freshwater turtles during routine disease surveillance at Alligator Creek, Townsville, Australia. Previous attempts to identify the causative agent of these lesions were unsuccessful; however, existing evidence suggests viral etiology. To further investigate these events, blood samples and lesion, oral and cloacal swabs collected from 128 freshwater turtles at two locations (Alligator Creek and Ross River) were screened for herpesvirus, adenovirus, poxvirus and papillomavirus by polymerase chain reaction. We detected three novel herpesviruses (chelid herpesvirus 1–3) as well as three adenoviruses (saw-shelled turtle adenovirus 1–3). Phylogenetic analyses showed that the herpesviruses formed a distinct clade with the tumour-associated chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5 (<jats:italic>Scutavirus chelonidalpha5</jats:italic>) within the subfamily <jats:italic>Alphaherpesvirinae</jats:italic>. The adenoviruses clustered with members of the genus <jats:italic>Testadenovirus</jats:italic>. Although the novel herpesviruses and adenoviruses could not be linked to the occurrence of cutaneous lesions, further characterisation will help provide better insights into their clinical, epidemiological and conservation significance.</jats:p>

AB  - The land of the "Cetatea Histria" Museum Complex, the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve, holds a large population of Testudo graeca, relatively well isolated due to the existing fence around the land of museum and the lack of suitable habitat in the vicinity. The relative high density of individuals in this area, 1.68 individuals / ha, and low recapture rates, 9.25%, suggests a large population size. The presence of juveniles and the lack of individuals with tick infestation or traces of human violence on carapace or plastron indicate a viable population which occupies an area with limited human activity. Resume. Le perimetre du Complexe Museal «Cetatea Histria», Reserve de la biosphere du Delta du Danube, est habite par une importante population de Testudo graeca relativement bien isolee en raison de la barriere existante et le manque d'habitat convenable a proximite. La forte densite relative des individus dans ce domaine et la recapture faible suggerent une grande population. La presence de nombreux juveniles et aucune infestation de tiques observees ou de violence humaine sur la carapace ou le plastron, montrent une reproduction de la population qoccupe une supericie ou l'activite humaine est limitee.

AB  - I PURPOSE dealing with statistics compiled from information afforded me by two German firms and one Austrian, Messrs. Zeiss, Leitz and Reichert respectively, all of whom are well-known makers of microscopes, and the first named of many other optical instruments, including prismatic field glasses, of which, as is well known to you all, they were the originators. I must say that the figures quoted refer approximately to the end of the year 1899, since which date the average rate of increase has been more than maintained. Taking first the firm of Zeiss, in Jena, twenty years ago they employed fifty men; five years later the number had leaped up to 170, or more than three times as many; in another five years the number had practically been doubled, 327 being the precise number; yet another five years saw the number 580; while to-day (1899) they employ the astonishing number (astonishing, that is, for the class of instruments they manufacture) of 946 men, this grand total being made up as follows: theoretical staff, 22; office and dispatch, 36; mechanics, 322; opticians, 371; wood-workers, leather-workers, foundry-men, &c., 129. Of these men, 832 in number, including only those actually at work in the shops, 58, or 7 per cent, are foremen, and 178, or 27 per cent., are youths under eighteen. Turning now to Leitz, in Wetzlar, who, I may say, manufactures microscopes almost exclusively, we find the same steady progress, if not exhibited in such a striking degree. The numbers employed were: in 1879, 35; in 1884, 100; in 18F 160; in 1894, 200; and at the present day (1899) 253. This number is divided up as follows: theoretical staff, 4; office and dispatch, 9; mechanics, 164; opticians, 60; case work, &c, 16. The foremen number 10, or 4.2 per cent., and the boys 18, or 7.25 per cent, of the total number actually employed in the shops, viz., 240. The firm of Reichert, in Vienna, although smaller, shows an almost identical rate of progress with that of Leitz, the numbers being: employed in 1879, 20; in 1884, 40; in 1889, 75; in 1894, 100; present day (1899), 150; of these, 3 form the theoretical staff, 8 are employed in the office and dispatch department; while of the remainder 120 are mechanics, 30 opticians and 8 case-makers, &c, the boys being 15 per cent, of the whole. I am afraid the numbers given in detail do not always agree with the totals, but I give them as received.....

                <jats:p>Land-use change is one of the main threats to biodiversity on the global scale. Legacy effects of historical land-use changes may affect population dynamics of long-lived species, but they are difficult to evaluate through observational studies alone. We present here an interdisciplinary modelling approach as an alternative to address this problem in landscape ecology.</jats:p>
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Objectives</jats:title>
                <jats:p>Assess effects of agricultural abandonment and anthropisation on the population dynamics of long-lived species. Specifically, we evaluated: (a) how changes in movement patterns caused by land-use change might impact population dynamics; (b) time-lag responses of demographic variables in relation to land-use changes.</jats:p>
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
                <jats:p>We applied an individual-based and spatial-explicit simulation model of the spur-tighed tortoise (<jats:italic>Testudo graeca</jats:italic>), an endangered species, to sequences of real-world landscape changes representing agricultural abandonment and anthropisation at the local scale. We analysed different demographic variables and compared an “impact scenario” (i.e., historical land-use changes) with a “control scenario” (no land-use changes).</jats:p>
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
                <jats:p>While agricultural abandonment did not lead to relevant changes in demographic variables, anthropisation negatively affected the reproductive rate, population density and the extinction probability with time-lag responses of 20, 30 and 130 years, respectively, and caused an extinction debt of 22%.</jats:p>
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
                <jats:p>We provide an understanding of how changes in animal movement driven by land-use changes can translate into lagged impacts on demography and, ultimately, on population viability. Implementation of proactive mitigation management are needed to promote landscape connectivity, especially for long-lived species for which first signatures of an extinction debt may arise only after decades.</jats:p>

AB  - Sixteen individuals of Testudo graeca from four populations in southern Morocco were sequenced for part of the 12S rRNA mitochondrial gene to determine genetic variation between T. graeca soussensis and T. g. graeca, and to compare southern with northern populations of T. g. graeca. A network was produced including published sequences. Neither T. g. soussensis nor T. whitei can be distinguished from T. g. graeca using this marker. The Moulouya river valley has previously been suggested to separate western and eastern forms, but the western haplotype is also found in Algerian tortoises. The current molecular data support the existence of a single taxonomic unit in North Africa, T. g. graeca. Additional detailed morphological and ecological studies are needed to confirm this.

AB  - In the present study we describe the seasonal and daily activity patterns of the spur-thighed tortoise ( Testudo graeca graeca ) in the Southeastern Spain. We radiotracked eleven individuals (six females and five males) in the Sierra de Almenara (Murcia) between April 1998 and November 1999. Radiolocations were weekly and each individual was located between three and five times per day. In order to study the seasonal activity pattern we used the distances moved by the tortoises and the number of active and inactive tortoises. Daily activity pattern was assessed dividing the day into five periods and comparing the number of active tortoises in each periods. Our results describe a principal activity period during spring and an inactivity one during winter. The species can be active during autumn and be inactive during summer also, but in those cases the activity or inactivity are less intensive than during spring and winter respectively and it varies greatly among individuals. In general terms, the results are similar to those found at Southwestern Spain, but not to those found in Southern Morocco where there is no hibernation because they have moderate temperatures favourable for the species during winter. On the other hand, the differences with the population of Donana are the duration of the activity period and the dates when the autumn activity period occurs. These differences could be explained as a consequence of the climatical differences between these two sites. The ultimate results is a much longer activity period in Donana that could explain the bigger body size in the population of Donana.

AB  - Contact zones are considered as windows into the evolutionary process, allowing identification of factors influencing the evolutionary forces. Here, we combined phylogenetic and morphometric analyses to explore the evolutionary process affecting the taxonomic pattern of two subspecies of Testudo graeca (T. g. buxtoni and T. g. zarudnyi) across their contact zone in Central Iran. Our results showed high levels of phylogeographic and phenotypic variation in the contact zone. Two monophyletic clades including, clade 1 (T. g. zarudnyi) and clade 2 (T. g. buxtoni) were identified. Furthermore, four distinct subclades were found in T. g. buxtoni, across a wide geographic range. Divergence time analysis suggests that the two subspecies diverged from one another after the uplifting of the Zagros Mountains during the early Pliocene. Using neutrality tests and mismatch distribution analysis, we found no evidence of recent population expansion. Morphological associations among geographical populations in the contact zone found more distinctions, with some significant adaptive and non-adaptive morphological variations in these populations. These distinctive morphological populations can be considered as management units (MUs) to conserve the evolutionary potential of this species. Finer scale evolutionary studies are required to address the southern part of the Zagros mountain range, where the overlapping of mitochondrial clades and subclades has occurred. Such information is essential for effective conservation of T. graeca populations, preventing translocation or mixing of individuals without comprehensive genetic and morphological assessment.
