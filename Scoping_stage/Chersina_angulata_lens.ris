AB  - Abstract The reproductive cycle and egg production of Chersina angulata females, maintained under natural climate conditions, were studied over 29 months using ultrasonography. Angulate tortoises initiated egg production in February (late summer) and were gravid through most of the year. A short nongravid period in January indicates a cyclic rather than continuous reproductive pattern. Chersina angulata females produced one egg at a time, and clutch frequency ranged from one to six per year. Annual fecundity was influenced by the date of reproductive onset and egg-retention time; early ovulation and a short retention time increased annual fecundity. Egg retention time was highly variable (23–212 days) and correlated to ambient temperature (inversely) and rainfall (positively). Temperature had no direct effect on oviposition, but rainfall served as an important exogenous cue, perhaps facilitating nesting. Oviposition and ovulation were synchronized and females prepared a new egg immediately after ovipositi...

AB  - The heating and cooling rates of adult Chersina angulata were investigated to ascertain whether these tortoises can physiologically alter their rates of heat exchange. In addition, heart rates were recorded to provide an insight into the control of heat exchange.  C. angulata  heats significantly faster than it cools. Heart rates increase with increasing body temperature, and for all body temperatures heart rates were greater during heating than during cooling. This suggests that the cardiovascular system plays a role in the heat exchange of the tortoises, but further study is required to completely understand the thermoregulatory process.

AB  - <jats:p>In a captive colony of <jats:italic>Chersina angulata</jats:italic> in Cape Town, South Africa, we observed in 2015/16 retention of the last egg clutch inside the female until the hatching stage was reached, conforming to the generally accepted definition of viviparity. Retrospective climatic analysis indicates egg retention until the hatching stage co-occurred with unusually hot summer weather: the average air temperatures in December 2015 and January and February 2016 were higher than during the preceding five and the following 5 years when facultative viviparity could not be observed. Late December and January appears to be the critical period for females to either deposit their last clutch of the nesting season into a nest, or to retain the last clutch for embryonic development inside the female. Over the 28 December to 24 January period the minimum, average and maximum air temperatures in 2015–16 were about 3°C higher than in the five following years. This association of facultative viviparity with unusual summer heat suggests that hot ambient temperatures at the end of the nesting season may cue females to switch from oviposition to facultative viviparity. Compared to incubation in a nest this phenotypic plasticity of the reproductive mode—to retain during hot summers the season’s last clutch inside the female—may buffer the developing embryos from excessive heat exposure: females can thermo-regulate by moving among microhabitats whereas sun exposed shallow nests cannot escape high ground temperatures. This novel reproductive strategy has the potential to enhance the resilience of species to global warming.</jats:p>

AB  - Captive reproduction of the Burmese brown tortoise (Geochelone emys) has occurred repeatedly over a five-year period in the Honolulu Zoo. Maximum clutch size (51 eggs) exceeds that reported for other members of the Testudinidae. Nesting behavior in G emys includes construction of a large leaf-litter mound. Collection of nest-building material is accomplished by “back-sweeping” of ground litter within a distance of up to 4 m from the nest site. The nesting female assumes a “nest-guarding” behavior for a period of 2–3 days following egg laying. Eggs incubated artificially hatched in 63–84 days, with egg fertility at 78–84%. One hundred and three G emys were successfully hatched and reared during the period 1978–82.



A colony of endangered Madagascar angulated tortoises (Geochelone yniphora) have been maintained at the Honolulu Zoo since 1971. Courtship and mating behavior is similar to that described for the consubgeneric G radiata. Distinctive male “hooking” behavior during courtship in G yniphora is related to the exaggerated epiplastron development in this species. Egg laying has occurred repeatedly in the G yniphora colony since 1979 (mean clutch size = 4.2; N = 6) although no eggs have yet proved fertile.

AB  - Chelonian intranuclear coccidiosis has been reported once, in two radiated tortoises (Geochelone radiata), and is apparently rare. We describe intranuclear coccidiosis diagnosed histologically in two radiated tortoises, three Travancore tortoises (Indotestudo forstenii), two leopard tortoises (Geochelone pardalis), one bowsprit tortoise (Chersina angulata), and one impressed tortoise (Manouria impressa). Infection was systemic and involved alimentary, urogenital, respiratory, lymphoid, endocrine, and integumentary systems. Trophozoites, meronts, merozoites, macrogametocytes, microgametocytes, and nonsporulated oocysts were seen histologically or by electron microscopy. Intracytoplasmic and extracellular stages of parasite development also were identified histologically. Sequencing of a coccidial 18S rRNA consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product revealed a novel sequence that provided phylogenetic information and may be useful for further diagnostic test design. Intranuclear coccidiosis was associated with variable degrees of inflammation in all cases, was considered the cause of death in six tortoises, and was a substantial contributing factor to the cause of death in two tortoises.

AB  - Behavioural frequencies and time budgets for male and female Chersina angulata were recorded in spring, September 2004. The daily activity of the population was 10.51 ± 0.42 h (mean ± CI), but individual males and females were in the open for 2.57 ± 1.12 h and 1.58 ± 1.44 h, respectively. Both sexes spent nearly 3.5 h per day basking with 90% of the basking time in the cover of sparse vegetation. Feeding and walking were the most frequent active behaviours. The activity pattern of the sexes differed between 10:00 and 12:00 in the morning when males spent more time out of cover on active behaviours, particularly feeding, than females did. The daily activity pattern of the population peaked between 10:00 and 12:00, reflecting the activity pattern of the more active sex, males. Females were out of cover, active, and feeding at higher temperatures than were males. The high temperatures probably allowed females to complete activities more efficiently, reducing their exposure time and predation risk. Although fighting and mating represented small fractions of male time budgets, the extended physical presence through walking and feeding may help males to establish dominance hierarchies and enhance mating success.

AB  - Understanding variation in vegetation communities is integral to characterizing resource requirements of herbivores over their range. We evaluated seasonal environmental effects on the plant composition of two contrasting angulate tortoise habitats in the southwestern Cape. Plant cover, species diversity and the variety of growth forms were substantially greater at the West Coast National Park (WP) than on Dassen Island (DI). Although shrubs and grasses were dominant growth forms at the WP, herbs, succulents, restios, sedges and parasitic plants contributed 30% of the cover. Most species had low relative cover indices, and a few perennial species provided most of the cover. On the island, succulents and herbs were the only growth forms, and ephemeral plants contributed more than perennials did to plant cover throughout the year. Seasonal fluctuations in plant cover, species richness and diversity on DI were larger than in the WP, despite the island experiencing higher annual rainfall and milder temperatures. The perennial flora in the WP provided greater stability with smaller responses to high summer aridity and large temperature fluctuations. Although the WP supports a greater variety of herbivores, the island has a higher density of angulate tortoises, showing this species’ adaptability to a depauperate flora.

AB  - Angulate tortoises (Chersina angulata) were probably introduced onto Dassen Island, South Africa, at the beginning of this century. Historical records indicate distance from the mainland appears to prevent emigration from, or immigration to, this island population. We estimated population size and density using a mark-recapture method, and determined sex ratio and population structure in 1978 and again in 1989. These figures were compared with published values for a mainland population. Population sizes and sex ratios did not differ significantly between 1978 and 1989: density was 31.2/ha and 34.2/ha, and sex ratios were 1:1.18 and 1:1.17 in favor of males, respectively. In both years the population showed a preponderance of adults. However, mean and maximum adult body size was greater in 1989. The island population was similar to the mainland population in terms of sex ratio and density, but differed in that there were proportionately more large males and females on the island. Factors that might cause an increase in size of island tortoises include predation on different sized tortoises by mainland compared with island predators. Reduced competition on the island and the potential effects of isolation may also affect body size. We suggest that the limits to the size of the island tortoise population will be primarily determined by numbers of breeding penguins and rabbits, whose activities remove vegetation used by tortoises for food and cover.

AB  - Ultrasonography is a powerful new tool in reproductive physiology and ecology but quantitative evaluations of acoustic window efficacies are necessary to assess methodological accuracy. We evaluated the efficacy of the left inguinal, right inguinal and cranial acoustic windows for detecting ovarian follicles and oviducal eggs in three tortoise species. Incorporating cranial results improved upon inguinal efficacies for detecting follicles in the three species, and for detecting eggs in Chersina angulata, which had small inguinal apertures for its body size. The cranial window provided the best follicle results (highest numbers detected) but the left inguinal window provided the best egg results. This asymmetry was probably due to the primarily posterior position of the oviducts (eggs) and the pliable ovarian sheets allowing follicles to move cranially. The left-right asymmetry may result from intestinal asymmetry (i.e., between the cecum and descending colon) in obscuring ultrasound transmission or displacing follicles and eggs. Seasonal influences upon efficacies varied with species, partially due to species differences in a) reproductive cycles and b) size and number of follicles and eggs. We attributed other efficacy differences among species to differences in body size and shell morphology, especially the inguinal apertures. Correlation analyses revealed strong individual influences upon window efficacy, suggesting that individuals varied in the position of follicles and eggs and the degree of obfuscation by nonreproductive structures. The paucity of correlations between efficacies and body size reflects the complex interactions of body size, shell morphology, reproductive structures and reproductive cycles on efficacies.

Previous authors claimed that regional differences in body size, gular shield length and plastron concavity occur in the angulata tortoise, Chersina angulata, but no statistical evidence in support of these claims was provided. We obtained comparative data for the angulate tortoise from three regions in the Cape Province, namely the eastern Cape, the southwestern Cape and Namaqualand. Our data suggest that males from the three regions do not differ significantly in adult body size. Southwestern Cape females are, however, significantly smaller than those from the other two regions. Sexual dimorphism in body size, size of the gular shield and plastron concavity is well-developed in this species, although no significant difference in body size was found between males and females from Namaqualand. A similar pattern of geogra...

AB  - Elands Bay Cave has provided abundant large mammal and angulate tortoise bones from three Later Stone Age occupational pulses, bracketed by radiocarbon between 13 600 and 7800 b.p., 4300 and 3100 b.p., and 1800 and 300 b.p. (the radiocarbon ages here and below are uncalibrated). The mammal bones come from thirty-four species as large or larger than the Cape dune molerat. Fur seals, steenbok/grysbok, and molerat dominate heavily. Other species occur mainly as traces, especially in deposits postdating 9600 b.p. Fur seal bones appear first in layers dated to about 11 000 b.p., where together with intertidal shells, they record the post-glacial rise in sea level that brought the coastline to approximately its current position about 1400 years later. The terrestrial mammals record a change from moister, grassier surroundings before about 9600 b.p. to drier, scrubbier ones afterwards. Deposits dated between 12 000 and 10 000 b.p. document the youngest known occurrence of the large, extinct Cape zebra. Median tortoise size suggests that local human collectors were most numerous about 10 000 b.p., coincident with the time when the density of occupational debris implies especially intensive human use of the cave. Average fur seal age suggests people were present mainly in the August–October interval when dead or exhausted 9–11 month old seals would have been especially abundant on the nearby shore.

AB  - Fifty-two tortoises, comprising 50 leopard tortoises Geochelone pardalis, one angulate tortoise Chersina angulata and one marsh terrapin Pelomedusa subrufa were found dead along 8,4 km of electrified fences in the Thomas Baines Nature Reserve, eastern Cape Province. Sixteen of these mortalities occurred during a 132-day study period. Assuming reduced tortoise activity in winter, a conservative mortality rate of about 30 tortoises per year is estimated along the electrified fence in the reserve. Using regression curves based on detailed measurements of 109 leopard tortoises, the total length and shell height of 42 of the electrocuted animals were calculated from their plastron lengths. Most tortoises (93%) killed were young adults (200-400 mm total length). The height of the electrified wire measured at the point of electrocution of 30 dead tortoises was, with one exception, less than 200 mm above ground level. To reduce tortoise mortality in the reserve it is recommended that the electrified wire height be maintained at at least 250 mm above ground level, and that the fences be powered only at night.
Twee en vyftig dooie skilpaaie (50 bergskilpaaie Geochelone pardalis, een ploegskaarskilpad Chersina angulata en een gewone waterskilpad Pelomedusa subrufa) is langs 8,4 km geelektrifiseerde omheinings in die Thomas Baines-natuurreservaat in die oostelike Kaapprovinsie gevind. Sestien van hierdie skilpadvrektes het plaasgevind gedurende 'n studietydperk van 132 dae. As aanvaar word dat skilpaaie minder aktief is gedurende die winter, dan word daar na beraming ongeveer 30 skilpaaie jaarliks deur hierdie geelektrifiseerde drade gedood in die reservaat. Met behulp van regressiekrommes,gebaseer op mates van 109 bergskilpaaie, is die plastronlengtes van 42 van die dooie skilpaaie gebruik om hul totale lengtes en dophoogtes te bereken. Die meeste van die dooie skilpaaie (93%) was jong volwassenes (200-400 mm totale lengte). Die hoogte van die geelektrifiseerde drade, gemeet by die punt van elektrokusie van 30 skilpaaie was, met een uitsondering, minder as 200 mm bokant grondvlak. Dit word aanbeveel dat die hoogte van geelektrifiseerde drade ten minste 250 mm bokant grondvlak gehandhaaf word, en dat heinings slegs gedurende die nag geelektrifiseer word om sodoende skilpadmortaliteit in die reservaat te verlaag.

AB  - Blood films were examined from 154 wild and captive tortoises from four provinces of South Africa, including Gauteng, Kwazulu-Natal, North West and Western Cape. The five species of chelonians studied were Chersina angulata (Schweigger), Kinixys belliana belliana (Gray), K. lobatsiana Power, K. natalensis Hewitt, and Stigmochelys pardalis (Bell). Two species of haemogregarines, previously reported from Mozambique, were identified in blood films, namely Haemogregarina fitzsimonsi Dias, 1953 and Haemogregarina parvula Dias, 1953. Additional stages of development (trophozoites and probable meronts, merozoites and immature gamonts) in blood preparations from South Africa warranted the redescription of H. fitzsimonsi. A variety of hosts and broad host distribution range were observed for this haemogregarine, with all five species of tortoises parasitized, wild and captive, from all four provinces, in all seasons. In contrast, only two individuals of K. b. belliana and one S. pardalis, all three captive in Kwazulu-Natal, contained H. parvula with encapsulated stages resembling those of Hemolivia mauritanica (Sergent et Sergent, 1904). For H. fitzsimonsi, parasite prevalences, but not parasitaemias, were significantly higher in captive than wild S. pardalis; captive female S. pardalis also showed a significantly greater prevalence of infection than males, but younger, lighter hosts were not significantly more heavily parasitized than older, heavier individuals. The ticks, Amblyomma marmoreum Koch, 1844 and A. sylvaticum (De Geer, 1778), found attached to some tortoises, may prove to be definitive hosts for the two species of haemogregarines observed.

AB  - Behavioural and physiological thermoregulation were studied in Chersina angulata, Homopus areolatus and Geochelone pardalis. Results on behavioural thermoregulation (response to thermal gradient) suggest it to be of greatest significance in H. areolatus. Physiological thermoregulation was studied in terms of individual capacities to control thermal conductance. All three species showed definite capacities to thermo- regulate by altering conductance. H. areolatus appears to possess greatest physiological control of conductance and has a higher maximum preferred temperature than the other two species studied. Large specimens of G. pardalis show little physiological control of heat flux and this decreases with increasing size. C. angulata has a greater degree of control over conductance than G. pardalis. It is concluded that size alone can not explain all the different thermoregulatory characteristics. The study demonstrates the need for a holistic theory of physiology and ecology of thermoregulation in tort...

AB  - The daily oxygen consumption (VO2) pattern, the effects of varying ambient temperatures, season and mass on the resting oxygen consumption (RVO2) of Chersina angulata of the Eastern Cape were investigated. The RVO2 was measured using flow-through respirometry and specific resting oxygen consumption (sRVO2) calculated. To determine the daily pattern in the VO2 of C. angulata, the tortoises were acclimated in an environmentally controlled room (ECR) to an ambient temperature of 26 ± 1°C and a light regime of 14 hours of light and 10 hours of darkness (14L:10D) for at least a week prior to the RVO2 measurements. The RVO2 was measured at a constant temperature of 26 ± 1°C, and at three different light regimes, namely: 14L:10D, constant darkness (DD) and constant light (LL). There were no significant effects of mass or gender on the sRVO2 of the tortoises used. Rhythms in the sRVO2 were detected under all three light regimes. The amplitudes of the rhythm were largest at 14L:10D, followed by DD and smallest at LL regime. The persistence of the rhythmic pattern under constant conditions suggests the existence of an endogenous circadian rhythm in the sRVO2 for adult C. angulata. To test for the effect of ambient temperature on the sRVO2 of adult C. angulata, the tortoises were acclimated to 22 ± 1°C and a 14L:10D light regime prior to the RVO2 measurements. RVO2 was measured at eight experimental temperatures; 14°C, 18°C, 22°C, 26°C, 30°C, 35°C, 38°C and 40°C. The sRVO2 was not influenced by gender and increased with experimental temperatures, but this did not happen consistently over the whole range of temperatures tested. A plateau, possibly a thermal preferendum zone, was detected within the temperature range of 26 - 38°C. Determination of seasonal effect on the sRVO2 of adult C. angulata was accomplished by acclimating tortoises to standard summer and winter conditions. Seasonal effects were tested in the appropriate seasons. Winter experiments were conducted in winter and summer experiments conducted in summer. The RVO2 was measured at experimental temperature 14°C, 18°C and 22°C. In addition RVO2 of iv winter-acclimated tortoises was also measured at 10°C. The sRVO2 increased significantly with increasing temperature within the temperature range tested. No distinct pattern was observed in the seasonal acclimation of adult C. angulata. The metabolic rate-temperature curves of the summer and the winter-acclimated tortoises cross each other. Season and temperature had no significant effects on the mass-scaling exponent of the sRVO2. The exponent ranged from 0.48 to 0.73 within the temperature range of 22 - 38°C. Below and above this temperature range, the exponent ranged from 1.47 to 1.67. An inverse relationship was observed between sRVO2 and body mass over the temperature range of 22 - 38°C. At 14°C and 18°C, sRVO2 increased with body mass, while at 10°C and at 40°C the slope was 1.01.

AB  - In einem Schildkrotenbestand aus Deutschland verstarben mehrere Tiere plotzlich. Einige Pantherschildkroten (Stigmochelys pardalis) aus dem Bestand zeigten respiratorische Symptome. In den von einer erkrankten Schildkrote entnommenen Proben konnten mittels PCR Mykoplasmen und ein Herpesvirus nachgewiesen werden. Die Sequenzierung eines Teils des DNA-Polymerase-Gens des Herpesvirus ergab eine 99%ige Ubereinstimmung mit dem Testudinid-Herpesvirus Typ 4, das bisher nur einmal bei einer Afrikanischen Schnabelbrustschildkrote (Chersina angulata) in den USA nachgewiesen wurde.

AB  - A wild-caught Bowsprit tortoise (Chersina angulata) was received into quarantine and appeared clinically normal. Oral swabs for consensus herpesvirus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing were obtained during routine quarantine, and a novel herpesvirus was identified. Comparative sequence analysis shows that this virus is a member of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae in the proposed genus Chelonivirus. Host/virus co-evolution appears to be common amongst herpesviruses and their hosts, and the most significant disease is typically seen when herpesviruses jump to related host species. Previous studies have found some diversity of herpesviruses in tortoises. This report expands the number of known herpesviruses of tortoises. It is reasonable to expect that there will be significantly different clinical consequences of different tortoise herpesviruses in different species, and that identification of host/virus relationships will aid in clinical management of tortoise collections. Further work is needed to determine the clinical implications of this and other tortoise herpesviruses in different tortoise species.

You will notice that signs asking you to 'Please drive carefully' have been placed in the garden as well as 30 km/h speed limit signs. This is because the garden is a haven for three tortoise species, the Angulate Tortoise, also commonly known as the Bowsprit Tortoise or Rooipens (Chersina angulata), the Leopard Tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis subsp. pardalis) and the seldom seen Parrot-beaked Tortoise or Padloper (Homopus areolatus).

AB  - Chersina angulata females ovulate sequentially and oviposit multiple, mostly single egg clutches from early autumn (March) throughout winter and spring until early summer (December). No matter when eggs are laid, they usually hatch in autumn (March/April). Evidence based on circumstantial observations also demonstrates that wild and captive females occasionally retain the last clutch of the season until completion of embryonic development in autumn, conforming to the accepted definition of viviparity in reptiles. However, developmental progress throughout the year and embryonic stages of freshly deposited last clutches has not yet been reported. We candled all eggs laid from April to December in a captive colony of C. angulata in an outdoor enclosure in Cape Town, South Africa, to estimate developmental progress and embryonic stages. In all eggs laid during autumn, winter, and early spring (March to mid-October), vitelline blood vessels, indicating development had progressed to somite formation, only started to become visible at approximately the same time in late November. Until mid-spring, embryonic development of those eggs had been arrested prior to somite formation; the embryos underwent diapause until, presumably, increasing temperatures reinitiated development. Development then progressed throughout summer until the hatching stage was reached in early autumn. However, eggs laid in late spring (mid-October to November) skipped diapause, and embryonic development progressed without interruption, demonstrating that, depending on the season of oviposition, diapause in C. angulata is facultative. Candling of an egg laid in late December showed that, prior to oviposition, embryonic development inside the female had already advanced to an embryonic stage with well-developed vitelline circulation corresponding to Yntema stage 12. Contrary to the generally accepted wisdom that intrauterine embryonic development in the order Testudines is always arrested at the gastrula stage, embryonic development inside the female had already reached the stage of somite formation. This phenotypic plasticity in the expression or abolishment of preovipositional developmental arrest represents a transitional stage in the evolution towards viviparity.

AB  - Behavioural frequencies and time budgets for male and female Chersina angulata were recorded in spring, September 2004. The daily activity of the population was 10.51 ± 0.42 h (mean ± CI), but individual males and females were in the open for 2.57 ± 1.12 h and 1.58 ± 1.44 h, respectively. Both sexes spent nearly 3.5 h per day basking with 90% of the basking time in the cover of sparse vegetation. Feeding and walking were the most frequent active behaviours. The activity pattern of the sexes differed between 10:00 and 12:00 in the morning when males spent more time out of cover on active behaviours, particularly feeding, than females did. The daily activity pattern of the population peaked between 10:00 and 12:00, reflecting the activity pattern of the more active sex, males. Females were out of cover, active, and feeding at higher temperatures than were males. The high temperatures probably allowed females to complete activities more efficiently, reducing their exposure time and predation risk. Although fighting and mating represented small fractions of male time budgets, the extended physical presence through walking and feeding may help males to establish dominance hierarchies and enhance mating success.

AB  - We examined 126 wild tortoises to evaluate the shell changes due to sexual dimorphism and ontogenesis by the geometric morphometrics. Adult body shape varies substantially in males and females; adults showed different ontogenetic patterns between sexes: in females the posterior portion of the carapace narrows in the dorsal view, the carapace tends to assume a pyriform shape in the lateral view, and the plastron tends to lengthen of the midline and shows a slight lateral enlargement. Male shape changes towards the posterior portion of the carapace, a bending of the seam between marginal and pleural scutes, allowing the body to assume a hemispherical shape, and ventrally, the plastron narrows strongly, posteriorly. The latter feature was mainly due to the shortening of the anal scutes, probably facilitating copulation by allowing more space to move the long tail. A wider posterior in male angulate tortoises may convey greater stability in male-to-male combat. All the ontogenetic changes suggest a modification of the plastron formula, an important feature for chelonian systematics and taxonomy.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The current study examined burnt and unburnt tibiae of angulate tortoises from the intermediate and late Howiesons Poort levels at Diepkloof Rock Shelter (DRS) of Western Cape, South Africa, to ascertain heat‐induced osteohistological changes. Three types of bone damage caused by fire were recognized: (a) external color change in the bones but otherwise consistent osteological and histological features to unburnt bones; (b) partially burned bones with osteological features obliterated, but histological details still preserved, and carbon inclusions visible along the bone margins and within pore spaces; and (c) completely burned bones with obliterated osteological features, but overall shape is maintained, and except for the presence of cracks and carbon accumulations within pore spaces and around the periosteal margin, histological features are evident. Comparisons with other studies of burnt bone suggest that the bones at DRS were subjected to high temperatures of about 600°C to 900°C. Despite exposure to fire, histological features were intact in all the bones, permitting life history deductions for these angulate tortoises. During early ontogeny, uninterrupted fibrolamellar bone tissue (indicative of rapid growth rates) was deposited, whereas later in ontogeny, slowly formed parallel‐fibered bone tissue formed and growth ceased periodically. A minimum age of 10 years was deduced for two individuals, and closely spaced growth marks suggest that the sexual maturity was attained at 7–8 years. Based on the comparisons with modern angulate tortoises, it appears that DRS tortoises had slower growth rates, suggesting less optimal environmental conditions for growth prevailed at the time.</jats:p>

AB  - TEMPEL'S COMET, 1867 11.—M. Raoul Gautier has published in the Memoirs of the Société de Physique et d'Histoire Naturelle de Genève, vol. xxix. No. 12, a discussion of the orbit of the comet discovered by Herr W. Tempel, at Marseilles, on April 3, 1867, with especial reference to its appearances in 1873 and 1879. There are several points of especial interest about this comet: not only was it an addition to the number of known comets of short period, but it possesses the peculiarity of an elliptic orbit of but slight inclination, and of Jess eccentricity than that of any other member of the same class. Its spectrum, too, would seem to be unusual, for the imperfect view of it obtained by Dr. Huggins, May 4 and 8, 1867, led him to conclude that the bright bands, which it gave together with a continuous spectrum, were not those of carbon. Its orbit, and especially its period, is also subject to great perturbations from the action of Jupiter, and its perihelion distance was considerably increased between 1873 and 1867 without its aphelion distance being much altered. It had also been identified by M. Winnecke with the comet observed by Goldschmidt at Paris, May 16, 1855, in a search for De Vico's comet, but von Asten's inquiries have shown that the identification was an erroneous one.

AB  - Behavioural and physiological thermoregulation were studied in Chersina angulata, Homopus areolatus and Geochelone pardalis. Results on behavioural thermoregulation (response to thermal gradient) suggest it to be of greatest significance in H. areolatus. Physiological thermoregulation was studied in terms of individual capacities to control thermal conductance. All three species showed definite capacities to thermoregulate by altering conductance. H. areolatus appears to possess greatest physiological control of conductance and has a higher maximum preferred temperature than the other two species studied. Large specimens of G. pardalis show little physiological control of heat flux and this decreases with Increasing size. C. angulata has a greater degree of control over conductance than G. pardalis. It is concluded that size alone can not explain all the different thermoregulatory characteristics. The study demonstrates the need for a holistic theory of physiology and ecology of thermoregulation in tortoises.

AB  - A. hebraeum nymphae were found on 4 angulate tortoises and 13 leopard tortoises in the Addo Elephant National Park, Eastern Cape Province. Adults of this species were collected for the 1st time from a leopard tortoise in the Mkuze Game Reserve, Natal. The significance of this finding, in relation to the normal host preferences of this tick, is briefly discussed.

AB  - THE ASTRONOMISCHE GESELLSCHAFT.— The first and second parts of the twentieth year of the Vierteljahrschrift , issued by this Society, have been published as a single number. It contains reports from some thirty of the Continental observatories, detailing the astronomical work accomplished during the year 1884, and a Report from the Bureau of Calculation at Berlin, on the part of the Transit of Venus Commission, describing the progress made in the reduction of the observations of the transit of 1882. Dr. B. A. Gould, with the authority of the Government of the Argentine Republic, has offered the stereotype plates of the Catalogue formed from the Cordoba zones, to the Society, the gift carrying with it the sanction of the Government to a new edition being printed therefrom at such time as may be desirable. All the errors detected up to the time of Dr. Gould's communication have been corrected on the plates. It is almost needless to add that this valuable gift has been accepted by the Society, who will preserve the collection of plates at Leipsic.—The death is announced of Dr. T. Clausen, late director of the Observatory of Dorpat; amongst many other important contributions to astronomical science, his masterly discussion of the observations of Lexell's comet of 1770 will be remembered; his prize-memoir thereupon published in the Astronomische Nachrichten elicited from Bessel the eulogising remark—“Welche herrliche, oder richtiger, meisterhafte Arbeit ist die von Clausen iiber den Cometen von 1770; sie ist eine Leistung unsere Zeit, welche unsere Nachkommen ihr anzurechnen nicht vergessen werden.”

AB  - This paper reports a previously undescribed form of predation upon the angulate tortoise, Chersina angulata, in the West Coast National Park, South Africa. Twelve recently killed C. angulata were found, within an area of 4-5 hectares, during April 2000. The head and neck were missing from all individuals, while the rest of the body was undamaged. Spoor of the large grey mongoose, Herpestes ichneumon, was observed at a freshly killed tortoise and it is argued that this was the predator responsible.

AB  - The angulate tortoise Chersina angulata is unique among South African tortoises in having a single unpaired gular (extension of the ventral plastron) that is used to ram and overturn rival conspecifics. This behaviour has earned it the reputation of a ‘fighting tortoise’, and in this paper we test the hypothesis that the morphology of this tortoise is a result of intrasexual selection. Research was carried out on the tortoise population of Dassen Island in September 2004. Tortoises were captured and processed (body mass and five morphological measurements) in situ in the field. A total of 144 males and 99 females were sampled. Males were significantly larger than females for all body parameters measured. Males had significantly longer gulars (F=17.783, P<0.005, n=242) and greater posterior carapace width (F=143.664, P<0.005, n=242) relative to body size than females. A total of 66 male–male interactions was observed in the field. Males that won fights were significantly longer than males that lost fights (t=2.238, P<0.034, n=28) and had significantly greater rear carapace width relative to middle carapace width (F=5.591, P=0.026, n=28). Gular length was found to be irrelevant to fighting success. Tortoises of both sexes were placed upside down to compare righting ability. Males were significantly more successful at righting themselves than females (χ2=5.347, P=0.0208, n=70). It was concluded that posterior carapace width is a more important variable than gular length in determining male fighting success, and it is suggested that, in addition to righting ability, posterior carapace width may well be a trait under sexual selection in male angulate tortoises.

AB  - DETERMINATION OF THE CONSTANT OF ABERRATION.—Comptes rendus for March 16 contains an abstract of a memoir by MM. Lœwy and Puiseux, on determinations of the aberration constant, in which some of the results obtained by M. Lœwy's method are given. Up to 1828, astronomers accepted, as the constant of aberration, values which were comprised between 20″˙255 and 20″˙708, these being respectively due to Delambre and Bessel. Richardson then obtained the value 20″˙446 from a discussion of 4000 observations made with the Greenwich mural circle by his predecessors. In 1843, W. Struve proposed a value almost identical with this, viz. 20″445, as the result of a discussion of his careful observations made in the prime vertical. He estimated the probable error as 0″˙011, and remarked that he did not think any astronomical element had been determined with so great an accuracy. Struve's work was received with much favour, and appeared to render unnecessary, for a number of years, all researches on the same subject. However, in 1844, Baily deduced 20″˙419 as the most probable value, and in after years, Peters, Lundhal, and Lindhagen subjected to a minute discussion all the meridian observations, made at Dorpat and Pulkova, of circumpolar stars. From their researches, a value a little greater than that of Struve was found. Still, when these results were taken in conjunction with the determinations the most worthy of confidence the values 20″˙45 and 20″˙46 were obtained, thus supporting Struve's work. Nyren, from a discussion of observations made by Struve in the prime vertical as material for the study of nutation, derived the value 20″˙43. In 1853, Struve himself proposed to increase his number to 20″˙463 with a probable error of 0″˙017, but the reasons given to justify the change do not appear to be sufficient. Gylden, Wagner, and Nyren's ulterior observations at Pulkova of circumpolar stars gave the higher value 20″˙49. Later, in 1879–82, Nyren made another determination by Struve's method, and used a large number of stars for the investigation. He then found 20″˙540 or 20″˙5l7, according to the method of grouping adopted. More recently, in 1885, Küstner, of Berlin Observatory, found 20″˙313 by Horrebow and Talcott's method. Between these two last numbers, both of which represent a large amount of work executed with much care, the difference is somewhat greater than 0″˙2—that is, about twenty times the probable error estimated by Struve in 1843. This seems to indicate that the astronomers have taken a step backwards. MM. Lœwy and Puiseux do not enumerate the work done on the same subject at Greenwich, the Cape, Washington, and other Observatories, but point out that similar sources of error exist in all the methods employed. Lœwy's method, as is now well known, consists in placing before the object-glass of an equatorial a double plane mirror formed by silvering the sides of a prism of glass. This acts as a sort of compass of strictly constant opening, and brings to the eyes rays which make a constant angle with each other. Pairs of stars separated by a wide angle on the celestial sphere, but which together appear in the field of view, can easily be found, and the variations in relative position due to refraction or aberration can be measured micrometrically with great precision. The adoption of this method leads the authors to the following tentative conclusions:—(1) The number 20″˙445, proposed by Struve, is very near to the truth. It would be premature, in our opinion, to wish to modify it.

AB  - THE BINARY STAR β DELPHINI.—In 1873 Burnham discovered that the primary star of the well-known wide doublestar 13 Deiphini wa itself a very close double, and a few years' observations sufficed to shox that it was a binary star in rapid motion. As the companion star has now described over 180° of its apparent path, a fairly accurate approximation to the elements of its orbit is possible. An attempt has accordingly been made, first by Dubiago and more recently by Gore, to determine the orbit, with tolerably accordant results. The former makes the period to be 26.07 years, with perihelion passage at 1882.19 and semi-axis major 0″.55. Gore finds the period to be 30.91 years, and fixes the periastron passage at 182.25, with semi-axis major = 0″.517. The observations are fairly well represented by these elements, considering what a close and difficult object the star is to measure. According to Gore's elements the components were at their minimum distance, 0″.192, at the epoch 1879.91; and during 1879 Burnham failed to elongate the star with the 181/2inch Dearborn refractor. We hope that those double-star observers who p ssess sufficiently powerful telescopes will not lose sight of this interesting object.

AB  - The current study deduced the growth pattern and lifestyle habits of Chersina angulata based on bone histology and cross-sectional geometry of limb bones. Femora, humeri, and tibiae of seven different-sized individuals representing different ontogenetic stages were assessed to determine the interelement and intraskeletal histological variation within and among the tortoises. The bone histology of adult propodials consists of a highly vascularized, uninterrupted fibrolamellar bone tissue with a woven texture in the perimedullary and midcortical regions suggesting overall fast early growth. However, later in ontogeny, growth was slow and even ceased periodically as suggested by slowly formed parallel-fibered bone tissue and several growth marks in the pericortical region. In juvenile individuals, fibrolamellar bone tissue is restricted to the perimedullary regions of propodials as remnants of bone formed during the earliest stages of ontogeny. The epipodials are characterized by having parallel-fibered bone tissue present in their cortices; however, periodic arrests in growth are recorded at various times. Remnants of fibrolamellar bone tissue formed during early ontogeny occur in the epipodials of only a few individuals. Interelement variation is evident, in terms of variation in the orientation of vascular canals between individuals and within the same diaphyseal cross-sections. Different elements show varying cross-sectional geometry, which appear to be correlated with the fossorial behavior of the species. Our results show that of all the long bones, the tibia is least remodeled during ontogeny and it is therefore the best element for skeletochronology.

AB  - Chersina angulata egg retention times differ among sequentially ovulated eggs from February to November, being shorter in eggs ovulated in October and November than in eggs ovulated in February, April, May, and July. More time is required to achieve eggshell calcification from July to October than from March to June. In most instances (71%) females lay their eggs when the eggshell still appears relatively thin on the radiographs, with only few eggs becoming more prominently calcified prior to oviposition.

AB  - The site of Blombos Cave (BBC), Western Cape, South Africa has been a strong contributor to establishing the antiquity of important aspects of modern human behaviour, such as early symbolism and technological complexity. However, many linkages between Middle Stone Age (MSA) behaviour and the subsistence record remain to be investigated. Understanding the contribution of small fauna such as tortoises to the human diet is necessary for identifying shifts in overall foraging strategies as well as the collecting and processing behaviour of individuals unable to participate in large-game hunting. This study uses published data to estimate the number of calories present in tortoises as well as ungulates of different body size classes common at South African sites. A single tortoise (Chersina angulata) provides approximately 3332 kJ (796 kcal) of calories in its edible tissues, which is between 20 and 30% of the daily energetic requirements for an active adult (estimated between 9360 kJ [3327 kcal] and 14,580 kJ [3485 kcal] per day). Because they are easy to process, this would have made tortoises a highly-ranked resource, but their slow growth and reproduction makes them susceptible to over-exploitation. Zooarchaeological abundance data show that during the ca. 75 ka (thousands of years) upper Still Bay M1 phase at BBC, tortoises contributed twice as many calories to the diet relative to ungulates than they did during the ca. 100 ka lower M3 phase. However, in spite of the abundance of their fossils, their absolute caloric contribution relative to ungulates remained modest in both phases. At the end of the site's MSA occupation history, human subsistence strategies shifted to emphasise high-return large hunted mammals, which likely precipitated changes in the social roles of hunters and gatherers during the Still Bay.

AB  - The kelp gull (Larus dominicanus) is an important predator on the angulate tortoise (Chersina angulata) on Dassen Island, Western Cape, South Africa. Tortoise shell fragments (n= 142) were collected and measured. Using regression curves based on 184 live tortoises measured on the island, the size class of tortoises eaten by kelp gulls was determined to include tortoises from 38-124 mm (mean 84 mm) total length (mass 25-350 g; mean 130 g). It is probable that very small tortoises were also eaten, but totally consumed. It is suggested that predation on tortoises occurs during the autumn-winter by the small population of resident gulls (approximately 50 individuals).

AB  - Abstract Terrestrial tortoises, Chersina angulata (Schweigger, 1812), Kinixys belliana belliana Gray, 1831, K. lobatsiana Power, 1927, K. natalensis Hewitt, 1935, and Stigmochelys pardalis (Bell, 1828), both wild (n  =  84) and captive (n  =  70), were examined for hematozoans from the provinces of Gauteng, Kwazulu-Natal, North West, and Western Cape, South Africa. In Giemsa-stained blood films, 2 species of hemoproteids were identified, 1 previously described, that is, Haemoproteus testudinalis (Laveran, 1905) Wenyon, 1915, the other unknown. Haemoproteus testudinalis occurred in 2/27 wild K. lobatsiana and 1/41 S. pardalis and 2/2 captive K. lobatsiana from the North West and Gauteng, respectively, whereas Haemoproteus sp. A was recorded in 1 of 3 captive K. natalensis from Kwazulu-Natal. Haemoproteus testudinalis had pale blue-stained, often vacuolated, halteridial macrogametocytes, pale pink-stained microhalterdial to halteridial microgametocytes, and dark, scattered, often bacillus-like hemozoin gran...

AB  - We examined the activity patterns of angulate tortoises, Chersina angulata, on Dassen Island, South Africa, during spring, summer and winter. During typical spring and summer days, C. angulata exhibited a bimodal pattern of activity, with activity being suspended around midday. However, during winter, and on cool and wet summer days, activity was unimodal, peaking around midday. Temporal patterns of activity appeared strongly influenced by environmental factors, particularly temperature. Chersina angulata were never observed to be active at air temperatures below 14.0°C or above 28.7°C. Activity levels were lowest during summer, when animals were active only 1.75% of the time. Brief appearances of available water (usually from condensing fog) during summer, however, resulted in a dramatic increase in activity levels. Males were significantly more active than females during summer and spring, but no significant difference was found between the sexes in winter. Results of this study are principally contrasted with those from a study conducted near the easternmost range of C. angulata, an area that experiences a markedly different climate.

AB  - The population parameters (morphometrics, population size and biomass) were determined for leopard and angulate tortoises in the Thicket Biome, Eastern Cape, South Africa. Leopard tortoises had a mean total length of 306.47mm (SD = 94.65mm, range 59–496mm,n = 89). Males were smaller (mean total length 277.31mm, SD = 71.85mm, range 73–377mm,n = 36) than females (mean total length = 332.33mm, SD = 97.64mm, range 59–496mm, n = 53). Angulate tortoises had a mean total length of 155.17mm (SD = 33.89mm, range 59–194mm, n = 18). Males were larger (mean total length = 186mm, SD = 8.40mm, range 174–194mm, n = 5) than females (mean total length = 143.31mm, SD = 32.48mm, range 59–178mm, n = 13). The estimated population density for leopard tortoises was 0.85 tortoises ha−1 with an estimated biomass of 6.02kg −1. Angulate tortoise population density was estimated at 0.12 tortoises ha−1 with a mean biomass of 0.06kg ha−1. The possible consequences of this high density and biomass are discussed.

AB  - Host-parasite relationships are partly determined by the inter- and intraspecific competition of the present parasiste community. Preference in attachment site has evolved to counter both interspecifc and conspecific competition along with threat of dislodgement and reproductive success in ectoparasites. 3929 ticks (Amblyomma sylvaticum) were collected in West Coast National Park, South Africa from 24 Angulate tortoises (Chersina angulata). Amblyomma sylvaticum uses spatial segregation in attachment site preference to allow for simultaneous success of all life stages. The high density of A. sylvaticum and its preferred host C. angulata create an environment where the parasite population's potential for growth and distribution is unparalleled by oth- er tick species in that location as seen through the lack of other tick species and A. sylvaticum presence on other host species.

AB  - An anomalous subfossil tortoise is described from a Holocene cave deposit at Pomongwe in the Matobo Hills, southwest Zimbabwe (Carbon 14 date 9400 ±100 yrs BP). This specimen appears to be unique in its truncated and depressed anterior carapace with loss of the normal second peripheral, but agrees with Kinixys Bell and Impregnochelys Meylan & Auffenberg in having numerous auxiliary scales. It may lack the carapacial hinge of Kinixys. The epiplastron appears most similar to that of a female Chersina angulata Gray.

It was first noticed as a black spot at ph. 20m. local mean time. Some little time previous to this it had been looked for on the disk but could not be seen either as a white or dark spot. The satellite was followed until 9h. 43m., and was then very black and rather small and round when best seen.

AB  - THE NEUCHÂTEL OBSERVATORY.—Dr. Hirsch, the Director of the Neuchâtel Observatory, has published his Annual Report for the year 1886, dated June 21, 1887. On the whole, Dr. Hirsch reports that, as far as his Observatory is concerned, the year 1886 was somewhat more favourable for astronomical observations than was 1885. In 1886 there were 154 nights on which observations were made, and 124 days on which no observations were possible, the longest interval without observations having been 7 days; whilst in 1885 the number of observing nights was 150, the number of days without observations 135, and the longest interval without observations 20 days. The meridian observations made during the year comprise 192 observations of the sun, 16 of planets, 1401 of fundamental stars, and 909 of stars contained in M. Lœwy's Catalogue of Moon-Culminating and Longitude Stars. The equatorial telescope has been employed in the observation of planets and comets with the ring micrometer, the position micrometer not being available until the small incandescent lamps, which are to be provided for purposes of illumination, have been supplied. Dr. Hirsch gives some interesting particulars with regard to the azimuthal movements of the meridian circle, as well as of the distant marks used for determination of azimuth error. The maximum easterly azimuth (+ 3.03s.) of the meridian circle during the year was observed on March 11, whilst the maximum westerly azimuth (- 1.02s.) was observed on September 1; the total range throughout the year 1886 was therefore 4.05s., the corresponding mean value for 22 years being 5.20s. It appears, however, that the three meridian marks (two to the north and one to the south) do not participate in this movement. The azimuth of one of the north marks, situated at a distance of 100 m. from the Observatory, varied during 1886 between + 0.24s. on May 19 and - 0.25s. on August 29, thus showing a total range of only 0.49S. The other more distant north mark showed a range of 0.42s., the extremes being + 0.18s. on April 16 and - 0.24s. on August 7; whilst the south mark at about 10 km. distance varied from + 0.40s. on May 14 to - 0.01s., on July 3, the range being therefore 0.41s. The marks are consequently well adapted for determining the azimuth of the meridian circle, the mean of the three giving this element, according to Dr. Hirsch's estimation, to ± 0.012s. nearly.

AB  - A total of 586 reptiles, belonging to 35 species and five subspecies, were examined in surveys aimed at determining the species spectrum and geographic distribution of ticks that infest them. Of these reptiles 509 were tortoises, 28 monitor or other lizards, and 49 snakes. Nine ixodid tick species, of which seven belonged to the genus Amblyomma , and one argasid tick, Ornithodoros compactus were recovered. Seven of the ten tick species are parasites of reptiles. Amongst these seven species Amblyomma marmoreum was most prevalent and numerous on leopard tortoises, Geochelone pardalis ; Amblyomma nuttalli was present only on Bell's hinged tortoises, Kinixys belliana ; and most Amblyomma sylvaticum were collected from angulate tortoises, Chersina angulata. Amblyomma exornatum (formerly Aponomma exornatum ) was only recovered from monitor lizards, Varanus spp. ; most Amblyomma latum (formerly Aponomma latum ) were from snakes; and a single nymph of Amblyomma transversale (formerly Aponomma transversale ) was collected from a southern African python, Python natalensis . All 30 Namaqualand speckled padloper tortoises, Homopus signatus signatus , examined were infested with O. compactus . The seasonal occurrence of A. sylvaticum and the geographic distribution of this tick and of A. marmoreum, A. nuttalli, A. exornatum, A. latum and O. compactus are illustrated.

AB  - Here we examine the tibial microstructure of modern and fossil angulate tortoises to assess the histology and growth from the late Miocene-early Pliocene, Pleistocene through to modern forms. The cross-sections of all the tibiae sampled revealed highly vascularized, uninterrupted, fibrolamellar bone tissue during early ontogeny, which suggests that early growth was fast. However, later in ontogeny, growth was slower, as indicated by the deposition of parallel-fibred bone tissue in the outer cortex, and even ceased periodically, as indicated by lines of arrested growth. Comparative analyses of the growth rates of the tortoises from different time periods showed that the tortoises from the late Miocene-early Pliocene Langebaanweg locality and from Diepkloof Rock Shelter had relatively slower growth rates under less optimal growth conditions. Additionally, these prehistoric specimens show extensive remodelling, and several generations of secondary osteons further suggest functional and/or metabolic stresses on the skeleton. Palaeoenvironmental reconstructions suggest that it was mostly cooler and drier with seasonal fluctuations in late Miocene-early Pliocene, and it is likely that <i>Chersina</i> responded to these conditions by having a lower rate of growth as compared with their modern counterparts, which thrive in the current prevailing more favourable Mediterranean type of climate.

AB  - THE SPECTRUM OF THE CHROMOSPHERE.—At the recent meeting of the Astronomical and Astrophysical Society of America, held at Washington, Mr. S. A. Mitchell read a paper on the observations made during the total solar eclipse in Sumatra on May 18, 1901. The spectrum photographs were obtained with an objective grating spectrograph; the grating had a ruled surface 31/2× 5 inches, with 15,000 lines to the inch, the objective being a quartz lens of a little more than 31/4 inches aperture and about 72 inches focal length. Light from the eclipsed sun was reflected into this instrument by a coelostat. The adjustments were such as to ensure a “normal” spectrum, this being the case when grating and photographic plate were each perpendicular to the diffracted beam. The first order was employed, from λ 3000 to λ 6000. Although the sky was never clear during the period of totality of 5 min. 41 secs., eight exposures were made—one before and one just after totality for the cusp spectra, one at first and one at second flash, and four with varying exposures during the total phase. The second flash appeared fully exposed, and the plate has been carefully measured. The dispersion is such that from Hβ to Hɛ occupies a length of 95.4 mm., i.e. 1 tenth-metre correspjnds to about 0.1 mm. In the region mentioned, Hβ to Hɛ, 363 lines have been determined. Of these, 269 have been identified with lines on Rowland's map.

AB  - Some ectotherms show daily fluctuations in their metabolic rate (MR) within their experienced temperature range. The rhythms may disappear or persist in constant conditions in the laboratory. The resting oxygen consumption (RVO2) of resting Chersina angulata was measured using open flow through respirometry over 24 hours to detect the presence of daily fluctuations in MR. The tortoises were acclimated in an environmentally controlled room to an ambient temperature of 26 ± 1 °C and a 14L:10D light regime prior to the resting VO2 measurements. The VO2 was measured when tortoises were resting at a constant temperature of 26 ± 1 °C and at three different light regimes, 14L:10D, DD and LL. Daily rhythms in the MR were detected at all three light regimes. However, the rhythm was more pronounced at 14L:10D than at DD and LL. Higher values of resting MR were registered in the early hours of the day, followed by a decrease as the day progressed, while the lowest values were recorded in the late hours of the day. Under constant conditions, the rhythmic pattern persisted, but with smaller amplitudes. Consequently, the rhythm is considered to be circadian and endogenous.

Trouvelot has previously recorded a remarkable luminous outburst that occurred on the sun on June 17. The position-angle of the group of prominences observed by M. Fényi was about 282°. At one time the velocity of one portion of the group reached the high value of about 850 kilometres per second. And another portion was elevated through about 72′ 2″in 210 seconds—the mean velocity being at least 485 kilometres per second. It is therefore concluded from the observations that matter can be projected from the sun into space with a velocity sufficient to prevent its falling back again.—Mechanical determination of the series of atoms of carbon in organic compounds, by M.

AB  - We investigated genetic variation within and among three populations of Chersina angulatal/Ig; 
two in the southwestern Cape (West Coast National Park and Dassen Island) of South Africa 
and Kleinzee in the northwestern parts of the species' range. Mitochondrial DNA sequences 
(274 base pairs) of the cytochrome b gene of 25 C. angulatal/Ig identified 10 haplotypes in three 
lineages. Estimates of coalescence time for the three lineages ranged from approximately 1.3 
to 3.8 million years, implying that the lineages' present distribution may reflect radiation 
during the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene Epochs. The mtDNA sequences of Dassen Island 
and West Coast National Park populations did not differ significantly. The geographic heterogeneity 
in haplotype frequency distribution suggests that the Kleinzee population represents a 
distinct lineage from the two southwestern populations. The observed genetic structure of C. angulatal/Ig has management implications for the conservation of this species. Until more 
information is available, we recommend that C. angulatal/Ig should not be translocated between 
the northwestern and southwestern regions, to prevent disruption of local gene pools.

AB  - Tortoises are one of the most common faunal components at many Palaeolithic archaeological sites across the Old World. They provide protein, fat, and other ‘animal’ resources in a ‘collectable’ package. However, for most sites their interpretation as human food debris is based only on association, rather than demonstrated through taphonomic analysis. Because of their very different anatomical configuration compared to mammals, it is difficult to conduct such analyses by directly applying the taphonomic methods used to interpret large mammal assemblages. Tortoise-specific taphonomic analysis is presented here for the Still Bay layers at the important Middle Stone Age (MSA) site of Blombos Cave (BBC), Western Cape, South Africa. Research on MSA subsistence systems at sites such as BBC has almost exclusively relied on analysis of large ungulate remains, in spite of the fact that many of these key sites contain equal or greater numbers of tortoise fragments. In this analysis we show that human modification is common on the BBC tortoises, and that there are consistent patterns of fragmentation and burning that indicate set processing sequences including cooking while in the shell, hammerstone percussion, and human chewing of limbs. The almost exclusive dominance of the angulate tortoise, Chersina angulata, is confirmed by full skeletal element analyses rather than only counts of single elements such as humeri. The sex distribution can be reconstructed for this species, and is female-biased. For all tortoise assemblages, taxonomic and skeletal element abundance data should be calculated from a sample of complete elements, or at minimum the entoplastron and humerus. A sample of shell and limb/girdle elements should also be subjected to microscopic bone surface modification analysis, as modifications are often rare or subtle but highly informative. Using this approach, analysis of breakage patterns, bone surface modification, and burning patterns can be understood together to specifically reconstruct tortoise collection, processing, and human dietary significance across a range of archaeological sites.

AB  - SIR L. PLAYFAIR asked the Secretary to the Treasury on Monday whether any answer had been given to the application of the Marine Biological Association for aid in establishing a station on Plymouth Sound to investigate the marine fauna and flora, especially in their relation to the food-fishes of these islands, and for which station 8000l. had already been subscribed from private resources. Sir H. Holland in reply stated that this application had received much consideration both from the present Government and its predecessors, and a letter was written to the association a fortnight since in which the Treasury undertook in general terms to ask Parliament for an annual grant for a term of years in aid of their undertaking, on condition that their work should be carried on in full concert with the Scotch Fishery Board, to whom Parliament has already granted considerable sums for similar objects. In the view of the Government these two bodies must be considered as working together towards the common benefit of the fishermen and fish consumers of the three kingdoms. On the whole this is satisfactory. No doubt it is desirable to form a central authority for dealing with fishery statistics and the scientific problems of fisheries for the three kingdoms. But this will take time; and in the meanwhile it is to be expected that the Marine Biological Association will receive Government aid so as not to delay its useful work. The condition as to common action and harmony with the Scotch Fishery Board is very proper and is not likely to give rise to any difficulty. The leading and we believe only scientific member of the Scotch Fishery Board, Prof. Cossar Ewart, is a member of the Biological Association, and will no doubt co-operate in every way with that body. The Marine Biological Association is now a very large and weighty body, comprising all British zoologists. It is not to be expected that it should be controlled in any way by the Scotch Board, nor are we sure it would desire to interfere with Prof. Ewart's valuable researches. But there need be no difficulty, we should think, about consultation and harmonious action. With the expected Government aid the Biological Association will be able to spend the greater part of its 8000l. on building and equipping a firs,t-rate laboratory on the splendid site granted to it by the War Office. It will be able to carry out a definite series of investigations under the guidance of Profs. Moseley, Lankester, Giinther, Huxley, and other leaders of the Association, and may be expected, step by step, to build up that knowledge of sea-fishes which is so much needed. The work to be done will no doubt be thoroughly systematised and apportioned to different workers. It should IDC remembered timt ftie Marine Biological Association is not local: it aims at carrying on work on various parts of the English, Scotch, and Irish coasts, and in time, indeed, may become in all respects a national Association.

AB  - We do not know whether the availability of food plants is the primary factor enabling Angulate Tortoises to inhabit a wide variety of habitats along the southern and western coasts of South Africa. Here we used focal observations to study the diet of Angulate Tortoises over four seasons at two distinct sites in the southwestern Cape, the West Coast National Park (WCNP), and Dassen Island (DI). Seasonal fluctuations in temperature, rainfall, and food plant availability influenced the activity pattern and feeding activity of Angulate Tortoises. Tortoises were more active during the wet season, winter and spring, than during the dry season, summer and autumn. Diet differed between sites and among seasons. WCNP tortoises had a diverse diet of grasses, shrubs, herbs, and succulents, whereas DI tortoises ate mostly herbaceous plants. DI tortoises had few dietary choices available compared to choices available to WCNP tortoises. At both sites, herbs and seedlings were important diet components during the wet season. The dry season diet consisted largely of dry plant material. Angulate Tortoises on DI supplemented their intake of dry plant material with rabbit feces, which comprised more than 27% of the diet in summer and autumn. The opportunistic feeding behavior of Angulate Tortoises helps explain their distribution among a wide variety of habitats. Their persistence in disturbed areas is probably determined by the abundance of easily digestible, herbaceous plants during the wet season and the tortoises' low activity and low metabolic demands during unfavorable periods.

Information about the conditions of a combined indoor and outdoor husbandry and of their seasonal nutrition is given. Furthermore, this tortoise's interesting behaviour is described, especially my observation of „normal“ interactions between male and females in a husbandry model without separation of sexes. Advice on how to avoid stress and environmentally associated health problems are given. Difficulties with artificial incubation and successful incubation in the enclosure are described. Problems in raising hatchlings are discussed.
