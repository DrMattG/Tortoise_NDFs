AB  - Optimal conditions of farm incubation of tortoise Agrionemys (Testudo) horsfieldii (Gray 1844) eggs at Zoocomplex (Republic of Uzbekistan) are described. Our technology of collection, storage and transportation of eggs has been tried out. Main statistical values (MSV) to characterize the average level of varying characters are identified. A brief characteristics of the parameters of an incubated tortoise egg to achieve the best results is given (an egg length of 45 50 mm; a width 33 34 mm; a weight 21 25 g; a shape index, 61 65%; an average cubic size 33 38 mm). The mortality of embryos during incubation reached 25%. Optimal conditions for rearing of healthy young tortoises were selected. A scientific and industrial program of reproduction of this tortoise species in nursery conditions has been developed as a result of our study of the conditions of maintenance and reproduction of tortoise A. horsfieldii Gray, owing to which the annual withdrawal of tortoises from wild nature for sale decreased at the expense of reptiles ranched at farms.

AB  - ABSTRACT A Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni boettgeri) from Germany was presented for medical examination showing signs of upper respiratory tract disease and hyperuricemia. The tortoise was kept with a Russian tortoise (Testudo horsfieldii) for 1 month before presentation. After 1 month of treatment, the respiratory symptoms disappeared. Herpesvirus (HV) was detected from an oral swab by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The use of different PCRs and sequencing a portion of the DNA polymerase gene demonstrated that the virus was identical to other HV isolates from Russian tortoises (tortoise herpesvirus 1, ToHV1) but distinct from HV isolates from other tortoises, including previously described HVs from Hermann's tortoises (ToHV3). This is the first description of the detection of a ToHV1 in a Hermann's tortoise.

AB  - Evaluating resource acquisition and allocation schemes, such as capital and income breeding, can help identify limiting resources, delimit critical periods of resource availability, and improve conservation efforts. Female desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) and Central Asian tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii) rely upon accrued body reserves to produce eggs, providing evidence of capital breeding. Although both species use capital to reproduce, nutrient income seems to influence current reproductive allocations, suggesting that both species use a mixture of capital and income for reproduction. The desert tortoise, Gopherus agassizii, relaxes homeostasis, enabling it to store nutrients as they become available, and to reduce metabolic expenditures to conserve body nutrient reserves when environmental conditions are poor. Although relaxing homeostasis facilitates survival and reproduction, desert tortoises are vulnerable in particularly dry periods.

AB  - THE molecular distribution of the metal in alloys of gold and of metals of the platinum group has been described by me in several papers, the most important of which has been published in the Philosophical Transactions . New interest in the subject has however arisen in connection with the extraordinary development in various parts of the world, and especially in South Africa, of certain processes which are now employed for extracting gold from its ores. Their use has been attended with the introduction into this country of a series of alloys of gold and of the base metals, which have hitherto rarely been met with in metallurgical industry. The base metals associated with the gold in these cases are usually the very ordinary ones lead and zinc; but their presence in the gold has given rise to unexpected difficulties, as the distribution of the precious metals in the ingots which now reach this country is so peculiar, that it is not possible to estimate the value of the ingots by taking the pieces of metal required for assay, by any of the well-known methods at present in use.

AB  - Cryptosporidiosis affects the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract of humans as well as of a wide range of companion, farm, laboratory and wild animals. In the past few years, three independent studies have provided strong evidence for the existence of a distinct Cryptosporidium species affecting tortoises and likely circulating in other reptile species as well. A new Cryptosporidium genotype was firstly detected and genetically characterized in a marginated tortoise in Italy in 2007 and named Cryptosporidium sp. ex Testudo marginata CrIT-20. The phylogenetic analysis of this isolate indicated that this Cryptosporidium was unique and belonged to the intestinal clade. These findings were later on confirmed by the detection of genetic homologies of isolates from a python and a chameleon from Spain and by recent research in the United States. The latter study presented both the occurrence of intestinal lesions in a pancake tortoise and a Russian tortoise and the genetic characterization of the isolates, together with the first pictures of the endogenous stages of Cryptosporidium CrIT-20. Phylogenetic inference based on the sequences representing small subunit of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (SSU) of these isolates confirmed the pathological findings because this Cryptosporidium was related to the intestinal group and supported previous results in T. marginata from Italy. The present scientific data on the Cryptosporidium CrIT-20 support its classification as a new species of Cryptosporidium causing intestinal diseases in tortoises. Although further morphological (i.e. exogenous stages) and biological aspects (i.e. complete host range) are yet to be elucidated, it is proposed that this Cryptosporidium is designated Cryptosporidium ducismarci.

AB  - In this study morphological characterization of leukocyte and erythrocyte were investigated in central Asian tortoise (Testudo horsfieldii) in Iran. 7 males and 7 females were used in this study. Erythrocyte and leukocyte morphology were described using Wrights technique. The sizes of erythrocyte and their nuclei were measured using an ocular micrometer under objective lenses (100x). Results of this study were compared with previous work on the other reptile species. Because there were no significant differences between the erythrocyte size of female and male tortoise, the data from the females and males of individual species were pooled. The mean length of mature erythrocytes was 1.98 µm (± 0.16 SD, with a range 1.10 - 2.50 µm).The mean width of mature erythrocytes was 1.10 µm (± 0.14 SD, with a range of 0.80 - 1.90 µm).The mean length of nucleus was 0.71 µm (± 0.09 SD, with a range of 0.50 - 1.00 µm). The mean width of the nucleus was 0.52 µm (± 0.07 SD, with a range of 0.40 - 0.70µm). Five types of leukocytes were found in

AB  - Herpesviruses are important pathogens in tortoises and turtles, yet little is known about the epidemiology of these viruses. We analyzed herpesviruses detected by PCR in samples from captive chelonians in Europe according to virus strain, host species, year and season in which the animal was tested, and country in which the animal was kept. A total of 4,797 samples submitted to a diagnostic laboratory in Europe between January 2016 and December 2020 were evaluated. Of these, 312 (6.50%) were positive for herpesviruses. The types most commonly found were testudinid herpesvirus (TeHV)1 (143 positive, 45.83%) and TeHV3 (153 positive, 49.04%), but also included TeHV2 (1 positive, 0.32%), TeHV4 (3 positive, 0.96%), Terrapene herpesvirus 1 (7 positive, 2.24%), Trachemys herpesvirus 1 (2 positive, 0.64%), and three previously undescribed herpesviruses (0.96%). Herpesviruses were detected in chelonians in the families Testudinidae, Emydidae, Geoemydidae, and in the suborder Pleurodira. Among the species for which 100 samples or more were available, the highest proportions of positive samples (positivity rates) were found in samples from Horsfield's tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii) (14.96%), and radiated tortoises (Astrochelys radiata) (14.05%). Among tortoises (Testudinidae), viruses were most often detected in the spring, while in emydid turtles (Emydidae) they were most often detected in the summer. A comparison of the positivity rates according to country showed significant differences, with the highest rate in samples from Italy (16.01%). This study indicated possible differences in herpesvirus positivity rates depending on host species, virus strain, year of sampling, season, and country of origin. It provides useful information in further understanding fluctuations in infection rates as well as in helping to guide decision making for herpesvirus diagnostics in chelonian patients. It also provides evidence for the international dispersal of herpesviruses with their hosts through international trade.

AB  - Summary The morphology and topography of the ciliary ganglia in the midday gerbil and turtle were studied with use of histochemical and histological techniques. The ciliary ganglion of the midday gerbil consisted of two cell agglomerations: the main ganglion and the accessory ganglion. The main ganglion was situated in the orbit and usually closely attached to the nerve for the inferior oblique muscle. The short ciliary nerves arose from the superior end of the main ganglion and reached the orbit. The accessory ciliary ganglion was smaller than the main ganglion. Usually it was attached to short ciliary nerves. The ganglionic neurocytes, 25.97 μm in diameter, were distributed regularly over the entire surface of the main ganglion. They typically had a single clear nucleus. The ciliary ganglion in the turtle formed a characteristic triangular structure on the inferior branch of the oculomotor nerve. The histological examination showed a small number of nerve cells in comparison to the nerve fibres. The neurocytes were placed mainly in the nasal part of ganglion and they had an irregular arrangement. The average diameter of neurons was 23.55 μm. Significant differences in density of ganglionic components in both species were observed. In midday gerbil the cells were densely packed and took up about 80% of a cross-section, while, in the turtle, neurocytes were located mainly in the surface part of ganglion.

AB  - Objective: The cardiac anatomy in tortoises depicted on B-mode and color-Doppler should be better differentiated by additional contrast-echocardiography. Material and methods: An intravenous contrast agent (INN-sulphur hexafluoride [SonoVue®]) was injected in four tortoises (three Testudo hermanni, one Agrionemys horsfieldii), via the coccygeal vein, with parallel B-mode echocardiographic examination. The results of the contrast-enhanced echocardiography were compared with the contrast-free B-mode recordings and color-Doppler ultrasound. Results: The use of SonoVue® enabled clearer distinction of the cardiac structures, differentiation of the arising major arteries, identification of wash-out-shunts, and visualization of blood flow patterns throughout the tortoise heart. Conclusion and clinical relevance: This study enables the accurate depiction and differentiation of cardiac anatomy in tortoises through the use of a combination of B-mode, color-Doppler and contrast-echocardiography. Basic knowledge of blood flow in the reptile heart is essential to understand echocardiographic anatomy. Blood-flow-patterns and anatomy of the tortoise heart as found in this study will help to establish a basis for further echocardiographic examinations of these animals.

AB  - THE International Medical Congress which it is proposed to hold in London in the beginning of August will be the seventh of its kind. The previous meetings have been held biennially in the principal university towns of the Continent. At the last meeting in Amsterdam in 1879, a general wish was expressed that the next should be in England, and the wish having been informally communicated to the Presidents of the College of Physicians and the College of Surgeons, they called a meeting of presidents or other delegates of all the Univerities, Medical Corporations, Public Medical Services, and the Medical Societies. The proposal to hold the Congress in London was heartily agreed to, and an Executive Committee was appointed under whose direction, and, especially, by the energy of the General Secretary, Mr. MacCormack, a very large scheme has been arranged for the discussion of the most interesting questions in all the divisions of the Medical Sciences. The Meetings will be held in fifteen sections, in rooms of most of which the use has been granted by the University of London, the Royal Academy, and all the learned Societies at Burlington House. Others have been engaged at Willis's Rooms. The officers and councils of the several sections include, with very few exceptions, all the chief and most active teachers and workers in the several subjects of medical science and practice, not in London alone, but in all the universities and great towns in the United Kingdom. In so far as general consent to the design of the Congress may be regarded as a promise of success, all looks well, and the agreement of our own countrymen is well matched by the assurances of co-operation already received from a large number of the most distinguished medical investigators and practitioners in both the Old World and the New. About 4000 invitations were issued, and it is expected that the roll of members will include at least 2000 names. Of course there are large arrangements for receptions and various hospitalities, and for making London as agreeable and instructive as may be in August; but if the design in the programme of the Congress be fairly fulfilled, a great quantity of hard and useful scientific work will be well done.

AB  - The Middle Asian tortoise Testudo horsfieldii is one of the most radioresistant animals, with Lethal Dose (LD) 50/30 around 500 Gy. Extracts were prepared from different organs of the tortoise, and their biological activity was evaluated. Crude extract from the spleen was found to significantly increase survival of mice treated with lethal doses of radiation. In an iterative process, the active extract was purified by chromatography, and the fractions were screened for biological activity. Various vital parameters were monitored: peripheral blood leukocytes, spleen colonies, mitosis in the bone marrow, and survival after 30 days. The process concluded with the isolation, characterization, and synthesis of the tetrapeptide FTGN, which accelerated repopulation of the irradiated bone marrow at very low concentrations both in vivo and ex vivo. A fluorescently labeled derivative of the peptide was found to selectively associate to CD34+ stem cells, suggesting that the peptide mediates their proliferation and allows fast repopulation of hematopoietic lineages. Interestingly, the peptide protected animals from alopecia. The studies in experimental animals suggest that treatment with FTGN can potentially benefit patients who suffer bone marrow damage due to radiotherapy or chemotherapy and patients undergoing autologous or allogenic bone marrow transplantation.

AB  - ABSTRACT Blood samples were obtained from Hermann's tortoises, Testudo hermanni, spur-thighed tortoises, Testudo graeca, and Horsfield tortoises, Testudo horsfieldi, by jugular venipuncture and were collected into heparin. Ionized calcium, sodium and potassium analyses were performed using the ion selective electrode principle. The effect of sample type (heparinized whole blood vs. heparinized plasma) and storage were evaluated. No statistically significant differences were found between ionized calcium levels determined from heparinized plasma samples stored for 48 hr at 5°C (23°F) and fresh heparinized whole blood. Mean ionized calcium levels determined from the heparinized plasma were: males 3.72 mEq/L (1.86 mmol/L), females 3.86 mEq/L (1.93 mmol/L) and 3.80 mEq/L (1.90 mmol/L) for the combined data. Sodium and potassium levels were also determined and there were statistically significantly lower sodium levels and higher potassium levels in the stored heparinized whole blood compared to the fresh hepar...

AB  - THE CLUSTER IN COMA BERENICES.—The results of a triangulation of the more conspicuous stars in this group have been recently issued from the astronomical observatory of Yale College. This contribution to a class of observations that is now receiving much attention, has been made with the helio-meter by Mr. F. L. Chase at the suggestion of Dr. Elkin. The instrument employed is the same that Dr. Elkin used in his measurements of the Pleiades group, and the method of reduction follows generally the same lines that were then adopted; but the different configuration of the fundamental stars on which the measures are based, has enabled the observer to dispense in some degree with measures of position angle, the less trustworthy coordinate in heliometer observations, and to rely upon measures of distance from six selected stars, five of which form nearly an equilateral pentagon, the sixth being approximately in the centre. Two lines of stars roughly crossing the pentagon at right angles, and extending some six degrees, have been utilised for determining the scale value. The final result is to give the coordinates of thirty-three stars (Equinox 1892˙0) limited to about the 8˙5 mag., below which magnitude the most satisfactory observations cannot be made with the Yale instrument. An examination of the probable errors of the measures, classified according to the magnitude of the stars, does not disclose any law dependent on brightness, so that Mr. Chase has not over-stepped prudence in this respect. At the same time the position of so many well-scattered points of reference has been determined, that it should be an easy task, and one worthy of accomplishment, to derive the places of the remaining and fainter stars of the group by means of photograohy.

AB  - Adenoviruses have been regularly detected in squamate reptiles; evidence of infection in chelonians is described much less frequently. The adenoviruses found in turtles and tortoises have been genetically diverse, and have included members of the genus Siadenovirus, a proposed testadenovirus genus, and, in a single case, an Atadenovirus. In this study, samples from 949 chelonians submitted to a diagnostic laboratory were screened for the presence of adenoviruses by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting a portion of the DNA polymerase gene. Adenoviruses were detected in 22 (2.3%) chelonians of different species. Adenovirus-positive species included Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni), spur-thighed tortoises (T. graeca), Horsfield's tortoises (T. horsfieldii), sliders (Trachemys spp.), box turtles (Terrapene spp.) and a black pond turtle (Geochlemys hamiltonii). Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of the obtained PCR products revealed that the majority of the detected adenoviruses (72.7%) cluster with members of the proposed testadenovirus genus, while the rest (27.3%) cluster with the atadenoviruses. This study significantly expands the known host range of both the proposed testadenoviruses and the atadenoviruses in different chelonian species and families.

AB  - Although no extant native turtle and tortoise species is known to occur in Mongolia, a new subspecies of the Central Asian tortoise was described by Chkhikvadze under the name Agrionemys kazachstanica terbishi in 2009. The description was based on a mummified tortoise kept in a museum collection. Since then the Mongolian steppe tortoise has been considered as an endemic taxon Testudo horsfieldii terbishi (Chkhikvadze, 2009) for Mongolia. However, there is no evidence for the occurrence of any wild tortoise species in Mongolia, even in the putative area of origin of the type specimen. The closest confirmed occurrence of Central Asian steppe tortoises is about 500 km away from Mongolia. Moreover, since 2010 the type specimen disappeared from the museum collection. Yet, there are several clues that the specimen in question was brought from Kazakhstan about 10 years ago to live as a pet in a yurt of a Mongolian nomadic family. Therefore, the recently described subspecies should be regarded as a “nomen dubium” and T. horsfieldii should be deleted from the faunal list of Mongolia.

From the time of existence of the Ogzi-Kichik population to the Present, noticeable changes (decrease of the shell length, its height and convexity and changes in the proportions of some plates of the shell) have occurred in the shell morphology of this species. These changes, probably, reflect intensification of the burrowing adaptations connected with the aridization of the climate in the Southern Tajikistan during the mentioned historical period.</jats:p>

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the relationships between total calcium and phosphorus and ionised calcium and phosphorus values in clinically healthy tortoises.



Methods: Jugular blood samples were obtained from 25 tortoises, as part of a health screen of the population. These comprised Hermann’s tortoises, Testudo hermanni boettgeri, spur-thighed tortoises, Testudo graeca ibera, marginated tortoises, Testudo marginata, and horsfield tortoises, Testudo horsfieldi. Plasma from these samples were analysed for total calcium, ionised calcium and phosphorus levels. These samples were taken in the immediate posthibernation period, before the onset of reproductive activity.



Results: Females exhibited statistically significantly higher levels of phosphorus. Ionised calcium and total calcium levels were elevated in females compared with males, but this was not statistically significant. Females did have statistically significantly higher calculated solubility indexes and statistically significantly lower ratios compared with males.



Clinical Significance: This study has provided an insight into the ratios and solubility indexes in tortoises, and this information may lead to further understanding of the significance of these parameters in chelonians.

AB  - We compared variation in phalangeal and carpal morphology of the Central Asian Testudo horsfieldii, a burrow- digging tortoise species, with its sister taxon T. hermanni, a Mediterranean species without extensive digging behaviour. Thirty-two Testudo horsfieldii kazachstanica shared the same phalangeal formula (0-2-2-1-1). The distal carpal 1 and metacarpal I as well as the pisiform were consistently lacking, sometimes also the medial centrale. Phalangeal morphology was more variable in Testudo hermanni hermanni. In 29 specimens four phalangeal formulae were found that differed with respect to the reduction of digit 1 (1-2-2-2-1, M-2-2-2-1, D-2-2-2-1, 0-2-2-2-1). The pisiform develops late in ontogeny and is lacking in very most juveniles and subadults. In contrast to T. h. kazachstanica, the medial centrale is always present. In both T. h. kazachstanica and T. h. hermanni carpalia increasingly fuse with age and size. The underlying morphological patterns differ however. The extreme character state in aged T. h. kazachstanica is one large solid bone element, formed by the fused intermedium, ulnare and both centralia. Aged T. h. hermanni have, in contrast, two separate larger carpal elements, one formed by the fused lateral and medial centralia and the other by the fused distal carpalia 1 and 2; the intermedium and ulnare never fuse with one another or with other carpalia. While a partial or complete loss of digit 1 seems to be characteristic for all Testudo species, we propose that the extensive fusion of carpal elements in T. horsfieldii is correlated with its natural history because a rigid manus could be advantageous for burrow-digging. Also the reduction of digit 4 (one phalanx present), a rare character among testudinids and not occurring in other Testudo species, could be linked with its mode of life.

AB  - Radiotherapeutic efficacious of the compounds from major organs and tissues of Central Asian tortoise--the animal known for its unique radioresistance, has been checked up. Along with the so well-known compounds as the plasma ones, tortoise spleen extracts (TSE) and the ones from the liver of adult animals and embryos, extracts from kidneys and muscles have been shown to increase the survivability rate of irradiated rats and mice. The compound, that called "Tortezin" shows the highest blood cell cytosol effect. The specific activity and the output are 4 and 12 times higher, than the ones of TSE, respectively. Dose increase factor (DIF) reaches as far as 1.41. The compound possesses considerable immunostimulating activity. The detailed physico-chemical characteristics of the compound, quite sufficient for its identification has been made.

AB  - Gegenstand und Ziel: Erstellung von 20 Blutparametern in Deutschland gehaltener mediterraner Landschildkroten und Vergleich der erhaltenen Parameter zwischen vier unterschiedlichen Landschildkrotenspezies. Material und Methoden: Bei 61 mediterranen, in Deutschland gehaltenen Landschildkroten wurden nach Blutentnahme aus der dorsalen Kokzygealvene hamatologische und blutchemische Referenzwerte von 20 Parametern erstellt. Die Untersuchung erstreckte sich auf Nachzuchttiere oder langer als drei Jahre im Besitz befindliche Tiere aus funf kontrollierten Bestanden. Alle Probanden wurden im Fruhjahr bis Spatsommer im Freiland gehalten und hielten regelmasig Winterschlaf. Die Futterung der Schildkroten erfolgte ausschlieslich mit pflanzlicher Kost. Die 61 klinisch unauffalligen Landschildkroten gehorten den Spezies Testudo marginata (Breitrandschildkrote; n = 16), Testudo graeca (Maurische Landschildkrote; n = 15), Testudo hermanni (Griechische Landschildkrote; n = 22) und Testudo horsfieldii (Russische Steppenschildkrote; n = 8) an. Ergebnisse: Median, Minimal- und Maximalwerte, sowie p-Werte wurden fur Hamatokrit, Alanin-Aminotransferase, Aspartat-Aminotransferase, Glutamat-Dehydrogenase, alkalische Phosphatase, Kreatinkinase, Harnsaure, Harnstoff, Cholesterin, Glukose, Fruktosamin, Gesamtbilirubin, Gesamteiweis, Albumin, Cholinesterase, Natrium, Kalium, Gesamtkalzium, ionisiertes Kalzium und anorganisches Phosphat ermittelt. Schlussfolgerung und klinische Relevanz: Bei 10 der untersuchten 20 Parameter konnten statistisch signifikante speziesspezifische Unterschiede festgestellt werden. Die Ergebnisse weisen darauf hin, dass bei der Interpretation der Blutparameter so genannter „mediterraner Landschildkroten“ unbedingt eine Speziesdifferenzierung stattfinden sollte.

AB  - Age and size at maturity are determined through complex interactions among size at birth, growth rate, maturation, and survival. We studied sexual size dimorphism and growth rate and maturation patterns in a long-lived organism, the steppe tortoise (Testudo horsfieldi), using the scute lamina number and width as age and growth measures. There was no sexual difference in the juvenile growth rate, but females matured later and hence were larger at maturity than males. We also observed considerable inter-individual variation in age and size at maturity. In both sexes, precocious animals grew faster during the juvenile phase but matured at a smaller body size than did tardy animals. Consequently, maturity did not seem size-dependent per se but rather was determined by growth rate. The strong variation between and within the sexes in age and size at maturity suggest that different growth trajectories and maturation schedules depend upon sex and individual responses to resource availability.

AB  - Objective: The biochemical characterization of the substances presented in the new haemoand immuno stimulating preparation Tortezin from the blood cells of the Central Asian tortoise. Materials and Methods: Tortezin substances manufactured in 2006-2010 were examined by electrophoresis, spectroscopy and RP-HPLC. Results: In UV spectra of Tortezin aqueous solution the pronounced maximum was at 218±1.2 nm and mild spike at 280±3.2 nm; in fluorescence emission spectra upon excitation with wavelength at 280 nm peak emission maximum was 460 ± 38 nm and at 295 nm was 455±21 nm. The RP-HPLC profile and SDS 10% PAGE showed the presence of repetitive typical peaks in different samples. Conclusion: The different methods are to be recommended for standardization of Tortezin.

AB  - In April 2002 – 2005, the feeding patterns of Agrionemys horsfieldii were studied in four different landscapes in Uzbekistan. At the four sites, with the combined area no less than 5 ha, 43 plant species from 17 families were recorded as forming the tortoise diet. The proportion of plant species and gill mushrooms consumed by the tortoise at these sites varied from 42 to 59% with highest feeding preferences was given to species from families Brassicaceae, Papaveraceae, Fabaceae, Poaceae. Some tortoises preferred species ( Anisantha tectorum , Hypecoum parviflorum , Leptaleum filifolium ) and these dominated in food in several communities while animals and other non-vegetable objects were rarely consumed (~2%). Spearman’s rank correlation between the level of availability of a plant species in landscapes and the proportion of its consumption by the tortoise was near to 0 in many cases and we are able to prove that the tortoise should be seen as a selective consumer (PSI = 0.22) rather than as a generalist. A number of species dominating in plant communities were not, or rarely, eaten and among these are plants containing alkaloids and ethers, as well as species with harsh fibers and thorny spikes. In each community there were three or five species constituting the base of the diet (63 – 81%) that sustained the population. The base part of the diet constituted the species which had both high availability in the community and a high index of electivity (Jacob’s index > 0.6). The tortoise’s habitat in arid and waterless desert landscapes requires high rates of water consumption which comes from its food: for this reason, tortoises prefer to eat species with high moisture content, even including some poisonous ones. However, it is quite possible that the consumption of poisonous plants also achieves antihelminthic prophylactics.

AB  - Abstract To assess implications for public health we compared the resistance of Enterococcus spp. strains to antibacterial drugs in wild and exotic animals with strains originating in domesticated animals and characterized correlations between Enterococcus species, the source of the isolate, and the degree of resistance to selected antibiotics. All strains, regardless of source, were susceptible to β-lactams, gentamicin, linezolid, and teicoplanin; the highest resistance was to kanamycin, quinupristin, and rifampicin. Thirteen strains from undomesticated animals were resistant to vancomycin, and one strain, from a fox, was resistant to streptomycin (high-dose). Multidrug-resistant strains accounted for 46% of the strains from wild animals and 59% of the strains from an exotic animal (the Russian tortoise; Testudo horsfieldii). Despite the relatively low level of resistance in the strains isolated from wild and exotic animals, the large number of intermediately susceptible strains in these groups is an ind...

AB  - From both the point of view of a person seeking a pet and from a conversation perspective Russian tortoises are one of the worst possible candidates available from the wild-caught reptile pet trade. Yet, for a variety of political and economic reasons this small tortoise has become one of the most commonly marketed species. Since the 1970s well over one million wild-caught adult Russian tortoises have been imported into the U.S. alone. Probably less than one or two percent of these are alive today. Testudo (Agrionemys) horsfieldii, the Russian tortoise (Figure 1), is distributed throughout much of central Asia from northern and eastern Iran, Afghanistan, northern Pakistan, and northwest China, to the southern territory of the former Soviet Union, and throughout various ex-Soviet republics Kazakhstan, Kirgizia, Tajikistan, Turkmenia and Uzbekistan (Figure 2; Iverson, 1992). Despite this seemingly extensive distribution, much of this area consists of climates, habitats and elevations of either marginal use or unsuited for these xeric tortoises. Based on Iverson’s distribution map for this species these tortoises appear to be mostly limited to sites in valleys along major rivers. The climatic extremes result in abbreviated periods of annual activity; in some cases this can be less than two months (Atayev, 1985), and protracted periods of estivation and hibernation. In much of central Asia, estivation starts in May–June with the desiccation of ephemeral vegetation. In some areas estivation extends directly into hibernation and the tortoises remain inactive for three-quarters of the year or more. Lagarde et al. (2003) demonstrated these tortoises were active only three months of the year, and during this active season they were inactive 90% of the time. Adult tortoises spent less than 15 minutes a day foraging. They do not feed on grass and typically forage on plants highly toxic to grazing mammals, thus avoiding competition with them. Three subspecies have been recognized but subspecific characteristics overlap geographically and detailed genetic studies and statistical analysis would be useful to determine the

AB  - The steppe tortoise (Testudo horsfieldi) is probably the most widespread and abundant of all living terrestrial tortoises, but paradoxically, this chelonian as been studied only superficially. Steppe tortoise populations are declining rapidly as a result of massive harvesting for the pet trade and extensive disruption of their habitat by intensive agriculture. Thus, it is urgent to acquire accurate information on major life-history traits. Our 5-year field study at the Djeiron Ecocenter in the Republic of Uzbekistan indicates that steppe tortoises usually remain buried in one place for over 9 months, which helps them cope with the extreme environmental conditions that occur in summer, fall, and winter. After emerging in late winter, steppe tortoises have less than 3 months in spring to forage to obtain the fuel needed for growth and reproduction, and replenish the body reserves necessary for the subsequent 9 months of total starvation. The mating period occurred between the end of March and mid-April and ...

AB  - The polymerase chain reaction with arbitrary primers (RAPD-PCR) was used to study intraspecific variation in Mediterranean turtle Testudo graeca, which is represented by the Dagestan (T. g. pallasi) and Nikolskii (T. g. nikolskii) subspecies in Russia. To study the phylogenetic relationships, the RAPD variation was also compared in two other T. graeca subspecies (T. g. ibera and T. g. terrestris), two closely related Testudo species (T. kleinmanni and T. marginata), and Central Asian turtle Agrionemys horsfieldii. Parameters of RAPD variation showed that the sample from different geographical regions of Dagestan was more polymorphic and heterogeneous than that from Central Asia. The two samples differed in the mean number of RAPD fragments N (48.76 vs. 40.40), number of polymorphic fragments P (78.7 vs. 32.3), and within-group similarity index APS (0.607 vs. 0.784). In T. g. pallasi, no significant difference in N, P, or APS was observed between samples from different localities of Dagestan or between groups of turtles with four- or five-clawed forelegs. A dendrogram of genetic similarity between the species and subspecies under study contained two clusters, one comprising all A. horsfieldii individuals and the other, all turtles of the genus Testudo. In the latter, T. marginata and T. kleinmanni showed higher similarity to each other than to T. graeca. The four T. graeca subspecies clustered separately from each other with a high reliability, T. g. nikolskii and T. g ibera (Turkey) being more similar to each other than to T. g. terrestris or T. g. pallasi. The possible causes of the presence of four claws on forelegs of turtles from Dagestan and the relationships among members of the genus Testudo were discussed.

AB  - Introduction of the host is the main reason behind introduction of the parasite, e. g., nematodes. The introduction of the Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) in Europe in the 1980s resulted in expansion of the swimbladder nematode Anguillicola crassus which soon invaded not only populations of the European eel (A. anguilla), but also other local fish. The raccoon (Procyon lotor) is native to North America. It is the specific host of Strongyloides procyonis and Baylisascaris procyonis. More than 90 species of wild and domestical bird and mammal species, including humans, have been infected with B. procyonis larvae. The larvae enter various organs of paratenic hosts, particularly the central nervous system and eye, causing severe diseases and death. Asthworthius sidemi--a blood-succking, abomasal nematode, a specific parasite of the Asiatic sika deer (Cervus nippon) and sambar deer (C. unicolor)--was first introduced with its hosts into countries adjacent to Poland. A. sidemi is especially dangerous to the European bison (Bison bonasus) which is its new host. The bison populations, in both Bialowieza Primaeval Forest and the Bieszczady Mts, sometimes show a 100% prevalence and mass infection intensity. Imported animals, sold in pet shops or available from private breeding firms, often carry non-native parasites. For example, the red-eared tortoise (Trachemys scripta elegans) and Afgan tortoise (Agrionemys horsfieldii) carry nematodes Angusticaecum holopterum, Tachygonetria lobata and T. robusta. Migratory birds in their wintering grounds are often infected with parasites which are usually not constant components of the native fauna, but sometimes nematodes could find a suitable conditions to complete their life cycle. E.g. Cyathosoma microspiculum, species specific to cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) and previously recorded only from Asia and the Asian-European boudary, was able complete the life cycle in Poland. The increasingly frequent travels to countries with different climatic conditions contribute to introduction of non-native nematodes: Dirofilaria immitis--in dogs, D. repens or Ancylostoma brasiliense--in humans.

AB  - Reproductive success is a critical measure of an organism’s fitness. Determining reproductive success in vertebrates is confounded by the concealed mechanism and timing of fertilization (e.g., sperm competition and storage). To assess the relationship between observed mating behavior and reproductive success in the central Asian tortoise, Testudo horsfieldii Gray, 1844, we determined individual genotypes from a captive colony of adults and their offspring. We constructed a size-selected genomic library from T. horsfieldii and screened for polymorphic microsatellite markers. The screen resulted in identification of two novel microsatellite regions. Cross-species amplification of microsatellite markers using primers developed for the bog turtle, Glyptemys muhlenbergii (Schoepff, 1801), resulted in isolation of three additional polymorphic microsatellites for T. horsfieldii. The five loci, which have between 5 and 17 alleles and observed heterozygosities between 0.44 and 0.90, were used to determine the freq...

AB  - We tested samples from 1,015 chelonians in Europe for Mycoplasma spp., herpesviruses, ranaviruses, picornaviruses, and ferlaviruses by PCR. Mycoplasma spp. were detected in 42.1% and herpesviruses were detected in 8.0% of tested chelonians. Differentiation of the herpesviruses revealed that 46.9% of the detected chelonian viruses were testudinid herpesvirus 1 (TeHV-1) and 54.3% were TeHV-3, including co-detections of TeHV-1 and -3 in 3 tortoises. TeHV-4 was detected in a leopard tortoise ( Stigmochelys pardalis), and a herpesvirus that could not be further characterized was found in a pond slider ( Trachemys scripta). Picornaviruses (topiviruses) were detected in 2.2% of the tested animals; ferlaviruses were found in 0.6%; no ranaviruses were detected in any of the animals tested. Mycoplasma spp. were detected significantly more often in Horsfield's tortoises ( Testudo horsfieldii), leopard tortoises, and Indian star tortoises ( Geochelone elegans) than in other species. Horsfield's tortoises were also significantly more often positive for TeHV-1. Mycoplasma and TeHV-1 were co-detected in 3.0%, and mycoplasma and TeHV-3 in 2.3%. The TeHV-4-positive tortoise was also positive for mycoplasma. Mycoplasma and picornaviruses were co-detected in 1.2% of the tortoises. A spur-thighed tortoise ( Testudo graeca) was positive for mycoplasma and a ferlavirus. In some cases, >2 pathogens were detected. A significant correlation between mycoplasma and herpesvirus detection was found. Of all tested animals, 47.6% were positive for at least one pathogen, demonstrating the importance of pathogen detection in captive chelonians.

AB  - ABSTRACT We documented differential blood cell counts and plasma polypeptide profiles in Testudo graeca and T. horsfieldii raised in captivity in Lebanon, and investigated bioactivity of T. graeca plasma against a human colon cancer cell line (HCT-116). The percentage of red blood cells, thrombocytes, heterophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils did not differ significantly between the species during winter or spring. The total number of plasma polypeptides differed between the species, with 2 additional polypeptide bands in T. horsfieldii. Plasma from T. graeca significantly affected the percentage proliferation and percentage viability of human cancer cell line HCT-116.

AB  - Specialization for a new habitat often entails a cost to performance in the ancestral habitat. Although aquatic lifestyles are ancestral among extant cryptodiran turtles, multiple lineages, including tortoises (Testudinidae) and emydid box turtles (genus Terrapene), independently specialized for terrestrial habitats. To what extent is swimming function retained in such lineages despite terrestrial specialization? Because tortoises diverged from other turtles over 50 Ma, but box turtles did so only 5 Ma, we hypothesized that swimming kinematics for box turtles would more closely resemble those of aquatic relatives than those of tortoises. To test this prediction, we compared high-speed video of swimming Russian tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii), box turtles (Terrapene carolina) and two semi-aquatic emydid species: sliders (Trachemys scripta) and painted turtles (Chrysemys picta). We identified different kinematic patterns between limbs. In the forelimb, box turtle strokes most resemble those of tortoises; for the hindlimb, box turtles are more similar to semi-aquatic species. Such patterns indicate functional convergence of the forelimb of terrestrial species, whereas the box turtle hindlimb exhibits greater retention of ancestral swimming motions.

AB  - I. Introductory. THE belief in telegony, or what used to be known as the “infection of the germ” or “throwing back” to a previous sire, has long prevailed. It may for all we know be as old as the belief in “mental impressions,” which has had its adherents since at least the time of the patriarchs. During the eighteenth century the “infection” doctrine was frequently discussed by physiologists, and since Lord Morton, in 1820, addressed a letter to the Royal Society on the subject, believers in “infection” have been increasing all over the world, with the result that one seldom now hears of breeders or fanciers who are not influenced by the doctrine, while physicians and others interested in the problems of heredity either as a rule take telegony for granted or see nothing improbable in the “infection” hypothesis.

AB  - <jats:p> A 3-year-old Horsfield tortoise was presented for lethargy, anorexia, blepharedema and mucopurulent ocular and nasal discharge. Culture of nasal exudates was negative, but real-time polymerase chain reaction on an oral swab revealed the presence of Mycoplasma agassizii. Multimodal therapy consisted of ocular and nasal flushing, systemic and topical antibiotics, nebulisation, analgesia and supportive care in the form of warmth, fluid therapy and nutritional support. As Mycoplasma spp. remain latent within the body, correction of husbandry and nutritional deficits was particularly important to enhance the animal's immune system, in order to prevent recrudescence of clinical signs. To avoid disease spread, the client was advised against introducing new tortoises into the collection. </jats:p>

AB  - На среднеазиатской черепахе отмечено паразитирование 4 видов простейших, 17 видов гельминтов и 6 видов клещей. Паразитические простейшие относятся преимущественно к споровикам (Sporozoa). Гельминты представлены круглыми червями (Nematoda) трех отрядов: Oxyurida, Ascaridida и Spirurida. Большинство видов нематод относятся к Oxyuridea, Pharyngodonidae. Наибольшее видовое разнообразие Pharyngodonidae приходится на 2 специфических для Testudinidae рода: Tachygonetria и Mehdiella. Из иксодовых клещей на черепахе наиболее распространен Hyalomma aegyptium, который паразитирует на всех фазах своего развития с преобладанием половозрелых особей. Экстенсивность заражения черепах H. aegyptium сильно варьирует (от 0 до 79%). Другие виды Ixodidae паразитируют на черепахе в фазе личинки и нимфы. Из их числа наиболее часто встречается Haemaphysalis sulcata. Из аргасовых клещей на A. horsfieldii паразитирует только Ornithodoros tartakovskyi, обитающий в норах мелких млекопитающих и черепах. Распространение всех видов клещей носит преимущественно очаговый характер. Наиболее частому их нападению черепаха подвергается в предгорьях, где на ней могут паразитировать одновременно несколько видов клещей. Активность паразитов синхронно совпадает с весенней активностью A. horsfieldii. Максимальная численность паразитов приходится на конец весны  начало лета. В период гибернации, особенно в заключительный ее период, черепаха испытывает минимальный пресс паразитов, что имеет большое значение для экономии энергетических ресурсов. Из спячки черепаха появляется с минимальной численностью эндопаразитов и без эктопаразитов.

AB  - A complex wide-range study on the haemoproteid parasites of chelonians was carried out for the first time. Altogether, 811 samples from four tortoise species from an extensive area between western Morocco and eastern Afghanistan and between Romania and southern Syria were studied by a combination of microscopic and molecular-genetic methods. Altogether 160 Haemoproteus-positive samples were gathered in the area between central Anatolia and eastern Afghanistan. According to variability in the cytochrome b gene, two monophyletic evolutionary lineages were distinguished; by means of microscopic analysis it was revealed that they corresponded to two previously described species-Haemoproteus anatolicum and Haemoproteus caucasica. Their distribution areas overlap only in a narrow strip along the Zagros Mts. range in Iran. This fact suggests the involvement of two different vector species with separated distribution. Nevertheless, no vectors were confirmed. According to phylogenetic analyses, H. caucasica represented a sister group to H. anatolicum, and both of them were most closely related to H. pacayae and H. peltocephali, described from South American river turtles. Four unique haplotypes were revealed in the population of H. caucasica, compared with seven haplotypes in H. anatolicum. Furthermore, H. caucasica was detected in two tortoise species, Testudo graeca and Testudo horsfieldii, providing evidence that Haemoproteus is not strictly host-specific to the tortoise host species.

AB  - Despite gastrointestinal parasites being commonly diagnosed in captive tortoises throughout the UK, there is a lack of data regarding the prevalence. The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in tortoises in the UK, and to investigate the factors affecting the prevalence of these parasites. Owners were invited to submit a faecal sample from their tortoise in conjunction with a completed questionnaire covering details of signalment and husbandry. Data from the questionnaires were analysed at the end of the study. Faecal analysis was performed on samples from Testudo hermanni, Testudo graeca and Testudo horsfieldii. This involved examination of direct wet preparations, a modified McMaster technique, passive NaCl flotation and Cryptosporidium staining. Of the 142 samples used, 130 were examined by the first three methods. 49 per cent were positive for one or more parasites. Of the positive samples, 67 per cent were positive for oxyurids, 28 per cent were positive for ascarids and 28 per cent were positive for protozoa (Balantidium, Nyctotherus or flagellates). Only 1/113 (0.8 per cent) samples was positive for Cryptosporidium. The most important risk factors for parasites were sex (F) and length of time (<5 years) in owner's possession. This survey showed that gastrointestinal parasites are frequently detected in the faecal samples of captive tortoises in the UK, but their prevalence may be influenced by various factors including sex, length of time owned, age and species.

AB  - Abstract. The egglaying (4 eggs) of a Testudo horsfieldii (1570g), which lives in a large outdoor enclosure since 1968, was observed. In a special breeding apparatus two hybrids hatched, the two other ones died in the shell. The parent's mating had not been observed. Fertile males of Testudo h. hermanni (7), Testudo horsfieldii (2) and Testudo graeca ibera (1) are living together in the enclosure with female tortoises. An analysis of the phenotype demonstrated the two hatchlings to be hybrids between T. horsfieldii and T. hermanni. The inauguration of a separate genus Agrionemys is critically discussed.Zusammenfassung. Von einer beobachteten Eiablage (4 Eier) einer Testudo horsfieldii (1570g), die seit 1968 in einer grossen Freiland-Anlage lebt, schlupften in einem speziellen Brutapparat zwei Bastarde, wahrend 2 Embryonen abstarben. Die vorangegangene Paarung konnte nicht beobachtet werden. In der Anlage Ieben fertile ♂♂ von Testudo h. hermanni (7), Testudo horsfieldii (2) und Testudo graeca ibera (1) . Durch Merkmalsanalyse der Bas tarde konnte eine Kreuzung zwischen Testudo horsfieldii und Testudo h. hermanni nachgewiesen werden . Die Berechtigung einer eigenen Gattung Agrionemys fiir die Art h orsfieldii wird kritisch diskutiert.

AB  - In 1930, Carl Wiman named a series of tortoise species based on fossils recovered from the Late Miocene (Baodean: Tortonian-Messinian equivalent) 'red-beds' of Shaanxi in northern China. The most complete of these specimens, an articulated skeleton including skull and carapace/plastron, was dubbed Testudo honanensis and has been considered a potential sister taxon of the currently extant Russian or Steppe tortoise Testudo horsfeldii; a species occasionally distinguished as a separate genus, Agrionemys, although recent molecular analyses advocate nesting within Testudo spp. A phylogenetic reassessment of Wiman’s original holotype using a combined morphological/DNA sequence data set suggests that T. honanensis is distinct from T. (Agrionemys) horsfeldii, and might be related to larger-bodied African taxa including Stigmochelys. Testudo honanensis could thus form part of a parallel radiation of Palearctic testudinids that migrated out of Africa, alongside the broader testudonan clade (= greater Testudo group), into Europe (via Anatolia) and Asia following the spread of dry savannah grasslands around 10 Ma. A Late Miocene influx of 'African' tortoises into Eastern Asia is consistent with the distribution of coeval Hipparion Fauna mammals, and supports interpretations of the modern Testudo spp. as vicariant remnants of what was once a much more widely geographically dispersed series of Eurasian lineages.

AB  - Kyrgyz Republic is situated at the center of Eurasia and has general borders with Kazakhstan,China,Uzbekistan, Tajikistan.Kyrgyzstan is surrounded by arid and extra arid plains of Central Asia,whose environment falls under hard influence of desert area that stretches in eastern hemisphere from Sahara till Gobi.The distance from the ocean and altitude amplitude from 500 to 7 134 m above sea level forms general aridity and continentality of climate. From north and south borders of the country with large deserts,there are a rich diversity of resources-species,ecosystems and land forms concentrated in Kyrgyz Republic.Abrupt change of habitat and straight removal of plants and animals from nature brought to extinction of a many species and put under threat of extinction some others in recent years.In order to further understanding of species diversity of amphibians and reptiles in Kyrgyzstan,a field investigation was carried out at different habitats namely mountain forest,grassland,wetland,cropland,residential area, and desert in northeastern regions including four oblasties:Osh oblasty,Jala-Abad oblasty,Talas oblasty and Chiiy oblasty,and three cities:Osh,Jala-Abad,and Bishkek of Kyrgyzstan by transects method from 15 th and 26 th September in 2012,and comparative analysis was made to the species diversity indices from the different habitats. The results showed that 621 individuals which belonged to 26 species(subspecies),18 genus,10 families,4 orders of amphibians and reptiles specimens were collected in totally.Among them 5 amphibian species belonging to 2 genus, 2 families one order,and 22 reptilian species belonging to 16 genus and 8 families were included.Bufo pewzowi,Rana asiatica,and Phrynocephalus saidalievi were the dominant species,and they accounted for 55.23%of the total species of the collections,Eremias velox,Laudakia himalayana,Trapelus agilis,Ablepharus deserti,Eumeces schneideri,Eremias yarkandensis,Natrix tessellate,Elaphe dione,Naja oxiana,and Testudo horsfieldii horsfieldii were the frequent species,and they accounted for 36.88%of the total collections,which make up of the basic components of the amphibians and reptiles distribution in Kyrgyzstan.The others 12 species such as Laudakia stoliczkana, Eremias arguta,Lacerta agilis,Eryx miliaris,Eryx tataricus,Vipera renardi were belonged to the rare groups,which accounted for 27.85%of the total species.There were significant differences in species diversity among the different habitats in these regions(p0.05),species diversity and richness were the highest in the grassland habitat(2.029 8),the second in the mountain forest(1.920 4),while the least in the desert(0.233 8);Abundance of mountain forest in the highest(3.242 5),and the lowest in desert(0.288 5).The southwest of Kyrgyz Republic's climate is typical continental climate,mainly composed of amphibian and reptile species adapted to arid environment and drought tolerant species,faunistic composition is simple,and less number of endemic species,the species composition, geographical distribution and the origin of the herpetofauna were similar with northwest China's.

AB  - Chelonid herpesvirus (ChHV) infection in tortoises associated with stomatitis-rhinitis complex is a severe, mostly epizootic disease characterized by proliferative and diphtheroid-necrotizing glossitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, and tracheitis, often occurring with pneumonia and encephalitis. The UL5 gene from a German ChHV isolate was used to generate a digoxigenin-labeled 307-base-pair DNA probe by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). ChHV DNA was detected in paraffin-embedded tissues of five naturally infected tortoises (two Afghan tortoises [Testudo horsfieldii], USA; two Hermann's tortoises [Testudo hermanni], Switzerland; one T. hermanni, Germany) by means of in situ hybridization (ISH) and PCR. Distribution of ChHV DNA exhibits many characteristics of alphaherpesvirus but also some characteristics of betaherpesvirus infections. The amino acid sequence of a portion of the ChHV UL5 homolog exhibited more than 50% similarity to alphaherpesvirus UL5 proteins. Nuclear hybridization signals were detected in epithelial cells of the lingual mucosa and glands. Furthermore, ChHV DNA was observed in tracheal epithelium, pneumocytes, hepatocytes, the renal tubular epithelium, cerebral glia cells and neurons, and intramural intestinal ganglia. ChHV DNA in endothelial cells of many organs underlines the systemic character of the disease. Importantly, ChHV DNA was detected by ISH in multiple tissues of tortoises originating from different geographic provenances. This indicates a high degree of conservation of the UL5 gene fragment among viruses prevalent in tortoises on different continents. With the described ISH, a molecular biological tool is available for rapid and specific diagnosis of ChHV infections and, more importantly, comparative pathogenetic studies of ChHV isolates from geographically unrelated regions.

AB  - In a population of about 130 tortoises, consisting mainly of Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) and Four-toed tortoises (Agrionemys horsfieldii), 50% of the reptiles died within 3 months in autumn 1987. Post mortem analysis of 5 necropsied turtles revealed thick, caseous coatings in the upper digestive tract, hepatomegaly and enteritis. By microbiological examination a lot of ubiquitous bacteria could be isolated. By electron microscopy of concentrated and negatively stained gut specimens herpes virus particles were found in two Hermann's tortoises and one Four-toed tortoise. Isolation experiments in embryonic turtle tissue cultures showed no evidence of a cytopathogenic agent. The results are discussed in respect of their importance for the high mortality observed in the population of mediterranean land turtles.

AB  - Herpesvirus infections are significant in the care of turtles and tortoises. Clinical signs range from unspecific symptoms, due to the variety of organ manifestations, to the "classical" picture of rhinitis-stomatitis. The presented case study showed the typical disease only with respect to clinical symptoms following hibernation, but lacks stomatitis, erosions or plaques in the oral mucosa. On the other hand, skin lesions on the extremeties, causative with herpesvirus infection, could be diagnosed. In this case study, various symptoms, sampling procedures and diagnostics using two different PCR methods are presented. Following hibernation, samples from a Russian tortoise (Agrionemys horsfieldii) were taken ante mortem and post mortem and screened with respect to virology, pathology, bacteriology and parasitology. DNA-fragments specific for tortoise herpesvirus were detected in various organs and body liquids. Furthermore basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies were found. The bacteriological examination showed a high level of Pasteurella testunis in the lungs. By parasitological examination nematodes (Oxyridae) were diagnosed. A potential prophylaxis tortoise herpesvirus is discussed.

AB  - ACCORDING to our contemporary l'Électricite, M. Exner of Vienna has discovered that a bismuth-antimony pair immersed in a gas incapable of acting chemically on either of these metals yields no current when one junction is heated. Also that if two bars of copper are soldered together to form a “pair” no current is produced when either junction is heated in air (as would be expected in a circuit of one metal), not even when both strips are exposed to the action of chlorine; but that if one strip only is exposed to chlorine gas and then one junction be warmed a thermo-electric current is set up. According to Exner therefore, all so-called thermo-electric currents are due to chemical action. It would be easy for some of our ardent young physicists to put to the test this very remarkable announcement, and see whether it is Herr Exner, or all the authorities on thermo-electricity from Seebeck to Tait, on whom we are to rely for the facts.

AB  - Backgrounds Many wild-caught reptiles harbor some kind of parasites. Captivity with negative effect of poor sanitary and husbandry management may lead to clinical disease. The increasing trend in keeping non-native reptile species in the last decade emerged a need for the specification of reptile parasites and their hosts. Objectives The study aims to gain data on intestinal parasites of reptiles kept as pets or in small private collections in close contact with people. Methods A combination of native and iodine stained direct smears along with flotation concentration were used to investigate parasites in pet reptiles’ feces. All samples were investigated macroscopically and a smear was prepared and stained by modified Ziehl Neelsen for detection of Cryptosporidium. Results Stool samples from 100 pet or small zoological reptile collections (Lacertilia=36, Serpentes=20, Chelonii=11, Corocodilia=1) were collected. The total occurrence of parasite was 52%. 64.8% of the examined Lacertilia, 35.3% of Serpentes, 45.5% of Chelonii were infected. Eimeria, Isospora, Cryptosporidium, Trichomonas, Balantidium, Strongylid and Oxyurid eggs and amoeba were identified. Cryptosporidium was detected in Lacertilita, Serpentes and Chelonii. In the only sample from a Nile crocodile no parasites were detected. Eimeria was detected in Bearded dragon, Indian python, Albino python and king cobra and Isospora was identified in Bearded dragon and the alien Cheloniid species Red-eared slider. Amoeba was identified in Iguana iguana and Horsfield tortoise. Conclusions Trichomonads, Balantidium, Cryptosporidium, Isospora, Eimeria, amoebae and nematode eggs were identified in the investigated samples. Cryptosporidium were detected by specific stains in 14 samples. Sauria was the most infected suborder (64.8%) while 32.4% of snakes and 45.5% of chelonians were infected. Parasites are common in pet reptiles but the parasite species, the degree of infestation and hygienic management will determine the ultimate clinical outcome of the existing parasite infections. Hence examination for endoparasites should be recommended for checking the health status of all captive or newly entering reptiles.

AB  - During 1991 and 1992, ecological observations of Cental Asian tortoise, Testudo horsfieldii Gray, in the wild were carried out in Huocheng Nature Reserve, Huocheng County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Huocheng County is the only distributon area found in China. This paper summarized the results of the studies.1.Study Area and Methods: The study area lied in 80°42.75'-81°4.6'E, 44°3.5'-44°17'N. The Cental Asian tortoise lived in the arid environment form 650 to 1 100m above sea leval, the average temperature was 9. 34℃, rainfall was 220mm, the dorminant vegetations in this region was the compound of ephemerophytelamb's-quarsdters-artimisa.The highed dendsity area of tortoise-Kantumandun was selected as the long-term study area. More than fifty tortoises collected from the wild were put into a pen of 20000m2 area in the habital of T. horsfieldi, the pen was digged with a border of 30cm depth prevented tortoises from running away. The body temperature of 5-10tortoises, substrate temperature, air temperature and illumination strength were written down every hours in active period of tortoises. The habitat selection and vegetation vegetation were surveyed with sample method. Food habit and reproductive behavior were obtained with field trackking,captive observation and raising methods, the population density was censused with line transect method.2.

AB  - A study of ultrastructural changes in the neuronal terminals of optic fibres at the level of tectum opticum (TO) in different periods after unilateral enucleation has revealed the process of degeneration in the optic system of Testudo horsfieldii as well as in Emysorbicularis L. to take a considerable time: from two weeks to six months. The character of destructive changes and the mode of utilization of desintegrated elements are dissimilar in different groups of retinal axons in the optic nerve and their terminals in TO. A comparison of the degeneration periods and the character of the changes in the optic fibres has made it possible to establish the following approximate correlations: all the nerve terminals of myelinated fibres degenerate after the "dark" type, whereas the terminals of non-myelinated axons are subjected to other kinds of transformations ("light", vesicular", neurofilamentous", "glycogen"). The analysis of the distribution of degenerating nerve terminals in the TO layers has demonstrated that there is a regularity in localization of different nerve terminals at certain levels of TO which is indicative of the layered organization of retino-tectile connections. Considerable differences in the neuronal and synaptic organization of TO have been revealed as well as in the character and the time of destructive changes of retino-tectile fibres after enucleation in T. horsfieldii and E. orbicularis.

AB  - Ranaviral disease in amphibians has been studied intensely during the last decade, as associated mass-mortality events are considered to be a global threat to wild animal populations. Several studies have also included other susceptible ectothermic vertebrates (fish and reptiles), but only very few cases of ranavirus infections in lizards have been previously detected. In this study, we focused on clinically suspicious lizards and tested these animals for the presence of ranaviruses. Virological screening of samples from lizards with increased mortality and skin lesions over a course of four years led to the detection of ranaviral infections in seven different groups. Affected species were: brown anoles (Anolis sagrei), Asian glass lizards (Dopasia gracilis), green anoles (Anolis carolinensis), green iguanas (Iguana iguana), and a central bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps). Purulent to ulcerative-necrotizing dermatitis and hyperkeratosis were diagnosed in pathological examinations. All animals tested positive for the presence of ranavirus by PCR and a part of the major capsid protein (MCP) gene of each virus was sequenced. Three different ranaviruses were isolated in cell culture. The analyzed portions of the MCP gene from each of the five different viruses detected were distinct from one another and were 98.4-100% identical to the corresponding portion of the frog virus 3 (FV3) genome. This is the first description of ranavirus infections in these five lizard species. The similarity in the pathological lesions observed in these different cases indicates that ranaviral infection may be an important differential diagnosis for skin lesions in lizards.

AB  - The ways of responding to novelty have not yet been thoroughly and comprehensively researched in reptiles, and studies undertaken so far have been conducted mainly on laboratory rats. The purpose of this paper is to present results of research carried out on the land tortoises Testudo hermanni and Agrionemys horsfieldii . Current research on tortoises as study subjects indicates that while undertaking environmental exploration these animals rely, to a large extent, on their sight, which is why this study employed visual stimuli to measure the tortoises’ response to novelty. In the course of the experiment, three objects were presented: the first imitated a biologically significant stimulus, the second was biologically indifferent, while the third was variable, and therefore perceived by the animals as novel. The results obtained suggest that the biologically significant and the variable objects elicited a response which involved the animals’ looking more intently at those objects than at the biologically indifferent object. It may be concluded, therefore, that tortoises have demonstrated exploratory responses which varied according to the object presented. While this study was only preliminary, the results obtained substantiate the view that tortoises may be interesting study subjects in comparative psychology.

AB  - It is the first time that Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), causing potentially lethal disease of humans, has been reported from the Middle East region and from the tortoise tick Hyalomma aegyptium from a tortoise host, whose epidemiological significance may have remained almost completely overlooked so far. We used RT-PCR to screen for 245 ticks collected from 38 Testudo graeca tortoise individuals. Results of our genetic screening provide unambiguous evidence of occurrence of CCHFV in this region and host, suggesting a potentially important role of H. aegyptium in CCHF epidemiology.

AB  - 3 Abstract: A clinical case of diarrhea in Horsfields tortoise (Testudo horsfieldi) was reported. It was characterized by weakness, anorexia, dullness, dehydration, depression and with profuse, watery and foul smelling feces. Microbiological cultural examination of fresh faecal samples from tortoises revealed that the diarrhea was due to E. coli infection, while by parasitological examination of helminthes' eggs were negative. The infection might be due to environmental pollution from human visitors, wild carnivores and other wild captive animals around the enclosures of the tortoises.

AB  - This thesis examines clinically relevant
 haematological and biochemical parameters in healthy European tortoises
 including Testudo hermanni,
 Testudo graeca,
 Testudo marginata
 and Testudo horsfieldii.  A total of 180 blood samples were taken
 from 60 tortoises kept in Germany
 and analyzed during three seasons of the year (spring, summer and fall).
 Every animal
 underwent a general examination, was weighed and marked for identification
 prior to taking blood samples exclusively from the vena coccygealis dorsalis.
 Twenty-one
 blood parameters were examined: Alanine aminotransferase,  aspartate aminotransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase,
 alkaline phosphatase, creatine
 kinase, cholinesterase, uric acid, blood urea
 nitrogen (BUN), cholesterol, total bilirubin,
 glucose, fructosamine, total protein, albumin,
 sodium, chloride, total calcium, ionized calcium, phosphate, potassium and
 packed cell volume (PCV).  Few
 studies on glutamate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, sodium, chloride, ionized calcium and
 potassium in the European tortoises exist. Studies on cholinesterase and fructosamine are non-existent to date.
 The blood
 samples were statistically analyzed as a combined total of all samples taken
 as well as according to species, gender, age and season.
 For the tested population following mean
 values were found: Alanine aminotransferase
 1,2 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase
 25,7 U/L, glutamate dehydrogenase 1,6 U/L, alkaline
 phosphatase 287 U/L, creatine
 kinase 63,3 U/L, cholinesterase 220 U/L, uric acid
 2,9 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen 7,7 mg/dl, cholesterol 118,2 mg/dl, total bilirubin 0,03 mg/dl, glucose 79,4 mg/dl, fructosamine 116,9 µmol/L, total protein 3,45 g/dl,
 albumin 1,48 g/dl, sodium 130,7 mmol/L, chloride
 109,4 mmol/L, total calcium 3,25 mmol/L, ionized calcium 1,35 mmol/L,
 phosphate 0,88 mmol/L,  potassium 4,6 mmol/L,
 packed cell volume 24,2 %.
 Biostatistical analysis of examined parameters
 resulted in the following: Creatine kinase, cholinesterase, uric acid, fructosamine,
 sodium and chloride showed evidence of statistically significant
 differences depending on species among  European tortoises. Apart from this
 and depending on the species examined, differences with regard to packed cell
 volume, alanine aminotransferase,
 aspartate aminotransferase,
 alkaline phosphatase, urea, cholesterol, glucose,
 total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, ionized
 calcium and phosphate were demonstrated, although not to a statistically
 significant degree. Cholesterol, sodium and total calcium showed
 evidence of statistically significant gender specific differences. Aspartate aminotransferase,
 urea, total protein, albumin and chloride showed evidence of gender specific
 differences as well, but not statistically significant. Cholinesterase, however, showed a statistically
 significant age related disparity. Packed cell volume, aspartate aminotransferase,
 alkaline phosphatase, creatine
 kinase, cholesterol, glucose, total protein,
 sodium, chloride, ionized blood calcium, total calcium and phosphate also
 demonstrated differences but none of statistic relevance. Packed cell volume, alanine
 aminotransferase, aspartate
 aminotransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase,
 cholinesterase, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, sodium, chloride,
 phosphate and potassium showed statistically significant, seasonal differences.

AB  - WE take the following from the March number of the Proc. of the Royal Geographical Society:—The eminent Russian traveller and savant, Col. Prejevalsky, intends, we are informed, to devote himself for some time to the preparation in retirement of a great work on the results of his travels, including, besides his recent expedition to Tibet, his previous journey to Lob-nor, of which he was prevented, by want of time, from giving more than a bare outline. The work is to consist of eight volumes, and to be entitled “Travels in the Deserts of Central Asia.” Volumes i. and ii. will contain the narrative and an account of the physical geography and ethnography of the countries he has visited, and will include also his surveys, the pictorial illustrations being from original sketches by his companion, Lieut. Robarofsky. Vol. iii. will be devoted to the mammalia of Central Asia; vol. iv. to the birds; vol. v. to the reptiles, amphibia, and fishes; vol. vi. to the flora of Mongolia; and vol. vii. to that of Tibet. Vol. viii. and last will contain the geology and mineralogy as far as materials will permit. The first two volumes, each containing 500 pages, and perhaps more, will be written by the traveller himself, and will appear towards the close of 1882. The ornithology will also proceed from his pen, as well as that portion of the zoology which treats of the antelope, buffalo, and a few other of the more important animals. The remainder will be written by the Academicians Strauch and Maximovitch, Professors Kepler, Inostrantsef, and Bogdanof and will be issued in parts. The whole will not be completed for several years. The work will be brought out under the auspices of the Geographical Society, and a special grant for the purpose will be asked for from H.M. the Emperor.

AB  - Herpesvirus infection in tortoises is largely characterized by the development of respiratory clinical signs. Usually lesions develop in the respiratory, oral pharyngeal, intestinal tract and are accompanied by cutaneous and ocular lesions. In chelonids affected by herpesvirus, systemic-type lesions in organs such as the liver and spleen are commonly observed. In this paper we describe a case of multifocal necrotic hepatitis associated with herpesviruses in an adult female land tortoise of the species Testudo horsfieldii. This article is the first description of a viral hepatitis in Testudo spp. with lesions compatible with herpesvirus infection, with no clinical signs or lesions in the respiratory system, oral cavity or other organs.

AB  - The Tibetan Plateau was visited annually between 1988 and 2001, mostly for periods of 3-4 months each year, sometimes for 4-7 weeks and once, in 1995, for 7 consecutive months. Except for a single summer, all visits took place in autumn, winter and spring. As logistics are difficult in this region, transportation was mainly by yaks or horses, accompanied and helped by monks who also acted as mediators between the local people and the visitors. Main objectives were to experience cultures relatively untouched by modem society, as well as studying ungulates and birds. Over the years, observations accumulated which were often at variance with presentations in field guides, handbooks and papers dealing with the region. Some of these observations are presented in this overview. The Tibetan Plateau covers about 2.5 million km² (Fig. 1), of which 50% exceeds 4500 m above sea level (85% above 3000 m). Of 810 lakes, 600 are to be found in the central range, the Chang Tang. Some lakes are huge, as the Kokonor Lake in the north (at 3200 m above sea level, 4400 km2). Most lakes have substantially decreased in size in recent years due to a decline in precipitation, often becoming salt along the way. Borders of fresh water lakes abound with waterbirds during migration and winter. Less than 1% of the Tibetan Plateau is presently cultivated, although locally – as in the Quadam Basin – this area has increased due to enforced settlement. Cultivated land is mostly confined to areas below 3300 m, but reaches an altitude of 4400 m near Yarlung Tsangpo. Permafrost is typical of the northern regions, penetrating as deep as 155 m; only the top layer of 50-60 cm becomes defrosted during summer. More than 30% of the Chang Tsang consists of Alpine- and steppe vegetations, dominated by Slipa species and Carex moorcroftii. The land climate is harsh, and even extreme above 4500 m (-40°C quite normal). In Shigatse and Lhasa temperatures are rather moderate compared to the Chang Tang. Wintering conditions in Ladakh are especially harsh because settlements and lakes are situated at higher altitudes than elsewhere in the region; temperatures of -50 to -60°C in January and February are not unusual. At similar heights in Tibet, the climate is equally harsh but as villages and lakes on average are situated at lower altitudes, living conditions are less harsh and many lakes are not (completely) frozen, offering opportunities for wintering waterbirds. Apart from extreme coldness, dust storms are typical of the region. On average, the local Bhuddist peoples live in harmony with their environment, as evident from the absence of hunting and fishing and the holy status of several lakes and bird species. Flowever, the “untamed” Goloks in the central Chang Tang are fierce hunters, responsible for almost exterminating species like Brown Bear Ursus arctos, and seriously depleting populations of Wild Yak Bos grunniens, Argali Ovis ammon, Bharal Pseudois nayaur, Tibetan Gazelle Procapra picticaudata, Chiru Pantholops hodgsoni and Urial Ovis orientalis. These depredations were especially devastating during the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution in the 1970s and 1980s. Although large areas are nowadays officially protected nature reserves (some as large as 334,000 km2), at the same time the Chinese government encourages settlers to invade the area. Where formerly wild animals populated the region, their stocks are now much depleted and cultivated animals like sheep and goats (30 million by 1990) and domesticated yaks (12 million ditto) have taken over. The presence and relative abundance of raptors in Tibetan and Ladakh parts of the Tibetan Plateau have been summarised in Table 1. It should be noted that observations during summer are limited to a single year, that conditions for observation are often difficult and that birds were only a sideline of research while staying in the area. Species-specific details are provided below. Black Kite Milvus migrans: passage migrant in large numbers in Tibet and China, with flocks of tens staying temporarily along rivers. Pallas’s Fish Eagle Haliaeetus leucoryphus: only observed in the Tibetan part of the range, i.e. an adult and juvenile on 3 October 1998 at Tar Tso (31°10'N, 84°0), a juvenile on 10 April 1995 at Am Co and an adult accompanied by a juvenile on 4 September 1995 at the Manasarovar Lake. Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus: adult singles were recorded near Lhasa on 6 January 1993, and on 4 April near Paiku Tso (29°N, 85°50’). Himalaya Griffon Gyps himalayensis and Eurasian Griffon G. fulvus: both species were heavily persecuted in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution, as in the Tibetan district of Gansu. Both are still in dire straits. In recent years, a slight increase in the number of breeding pairs has been noted, especially in the vicinity of Lhasa and Shigatse (but not in Gansu). This resulted from a change in the attitude of the Chinese government towards the existence and use of open-air burial sites (where vultures used to be fed with the corpses of the deceased); mercilessly destroyed in the late 20th century, some have now been re-opened, as in Lhasa. Red-headed Vulture Sarcogyps calvus: although formerly present on the Tibetan Plateau, it is now a rare bird, not showing an improvement in status compared with both Gyps species. Northern Goshawk Accipiter gentilis: mostly seen during migration. Birds passing in March and April are often harassed by territorial Sakers. White-eyed Buzzard Butastur teesa: twice recorded on Chang Tang (once dead, on 2 October 1992 near Nyalam, just north of Kathmandu, another in October 2001 in the same area). A third bird was seen on 18 October 1998 near Lunggar (31 °N, 84°O). Upland Buzzard Buteo hemilasius, Long-legged Buzzard B. rufinus and Common Buzzard B. buteo: the presence of these species is correlated with the distribution and abundance of pikas (notably Ocholona pusilla and O. curzionae). Large numbers of pikas are associated with ditto numbers of voles, providing excellent feeding conditions for buzzards. Rough-legged Buzzard Buteo lagopus: more common in winter than depicted in field guides and handbooks (as holds for many other wintering species). Steppe Eagle Aquila nipalensis: like buzzards depending upon presence and abundance of pikas, but also recorded at concentrations of waterbirds. Spotted Eagle Aquila clanga: commoner in winter than usually depicted in guides and handbooks. Preference for areas with large concentrations of waterbirds. Golden Eagle Aquila chrysaetos: on two nests in the Chang Tang region remains of the Steppe Tortoise Agrionemys horsfeldi were collected. Although this prey species is commonly captured (and killed by dropping it from great heights on rocks below) in eastern Kazakhstan, it is apparently absent from the Chang Tang (as confirmed by the local people). Eurasian Kestrel Falco tinnunculus: a ubiquitous species, occurring everywhere as a breeding bird and even present at high altitudes with extremely low temperatures in winter. Amur Falcon Falco amurensis and Red-footed Falcon F. vespertinus: respectively rarely seen and passing during migration. Laggar Falcon Falco jugger: never observed during the early 1990s, observations have increased in recent years with almost annually records nowadays, even in late autumn and in early spring. Saker Falco cherrug: present all-year round, especially in the Chang Tang. Juveniles disperse from the area. Territory defence starts already late January, irrespective of temperature. Breeding starts as early as the beginning of March. Twice a Saker was recorded as being killed by a Eurasian Eagle Owl Bubo bubo hemachalanus; in one such case, the owl simply dropped onto a breeding Saker which was taken by surprise. Gyr Falcon Falco rusticolus: one bird, which had broken its wing against a nomad tent on 27 February 1992 near Dinggo (33°20’N, 84°40’E), three other birds were recorded in the central Chang Tang between 32-34°N and 83-87°E, on 22 February 1995, 26 February 1995 and 1 December 1998 respectively.

AB  - Large numbers of pancake tortoises (Malacochersus tornieri) and Horsfield tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii) in three consignments imported into Japan died soon after arrival. Some tortoises in the first consignment were dead on arrival. Postmortem examination of two of the pancake tortoises and four of the Horsfield tortoises revealed necrotizing lesions of the oral mucosa in both species, primarily in the tongue. Eosinophilic to amphophilic inclusion bodies were visible in the nuclei of mucosal epithelial cells in the lesions. Similar inclusion bodies were observed in the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, stomach, lungs, kidneys, small and large intestines, pancreas, and cerebrum of the pancake tortoises and in the liver, spleen, and pancreas of the Horsfield tortoises. Electron microscopic examination of the cells containing inclusion bodies showed herpesvirus-like particles about 100 nm in diameter in the cytoplasm. Nested polymerase chain reaction analysis using a herpesvirus consensus primer method confirmed the presence of a characteristic herpesvirus base sequence in tissue from these lesions.

AB  - На основании внутривидового полиморфизма митохондриального гена 12S рРНК впервые изучена генетическая изменчивость обособленных популяций среднеазиатской черепахи Agrionemys horsfieldii на значительной части ареала, охватывающей Узбекистан, южный Казахстан, северный и восточный Иран. У 59 черепах выявлено четыре гаплотипа, два из которых (АН1 и АН2) были описаны ранее. АН1 характерен для 52 черепах, населяющих территорию южного Казахстана и Узбекистана. Гаплотип АН2 найден у четырех черепах с пограничной территории Узбекистана, Таджикистана и Афганистана. Два новых гаплотипа  АН3 и АН4  найдены у трех черепах из Ирана. На основании нуклеотидных замен 12S рРНК рассчитано возможное время дивергенции между черепахами из разных частей ареала. Обсуждаются возможные пути формирования современных внутривидовых группировок среднеазиатской черепахи А. horsfieldii.

AB  - FAYE'S COMET.—Dr. Axel-Möller commences his ephemeris of Faye's comet for the present year on July 1, when its distance from the earth will be 2.005, and that from the sun 2.53; the perihelion passage will not take place till January 22, 1881. The intensity of light corresponding to the comet's distances on July 1 is 0.039; in 1844 it was observed with sensibly the same intensity, the value for the last observation with the 15-inch refractor at Pulkowa being 0.035. The comet attains its greatest brightness in the middle of October, when the value corresponds to that at the last observation in 1858, with the 9.6-inch refractor at Berlin on October 16. At discovery by M. Faye in 1843 the theoretical intensity of light was 0.54, which has not been approached at any of the subsequent returns. The following positions are taken from Dr. Axel-Moller's ephemeris, which is calculated for Berlin midnight, or about 11h. G.M.T.:—

AB  - Since 1997, associates of Zoocomplex (Tashkent, Uzbekistan) implemented studies on hatching the Horsfield’s tortoise on farms at commercial levels. The technology of collection and incubation of eggs, and the ranching of young tortoises, was mastered. Several methods were applied to obtain eggs from tortoises constantly kept in captivity, those temporarily kept in the nursery, and incubated eggs collected in the wild (R). According to CITES, R (ranching) is a method based on the collection of eggs, incubation and artificial hatching. Totally, 20,000 eggs were obtained. Some eggs from various ranges were measured and weighed. Differences in sizes and weight of eggs collected from areas with different natural conditions were recorded. Egg length varied from 36.1 to 56.5 mm. The survival rate of eggs constituted 75%. A positive correlation between body sizes of hatched tortoises with egg sizes was recorded. The size of hatched tortoises reached 25.2 to 48.6 mm; the weight was about 20 g. During seven months of rearing, 5% of hatched tortoises died (against 70 – 90% in the wild). Of 15,000 hatched tortoises, recorded were 29 twin pairs, of which 13 pairs were normal and 16 pairs were asymmetrical twins; four terato-twin abnormalities with varying levels of terato-duplication were recorded.

AB  - <jats:p>Thyroid hormones and the factors influencing them are rarely studied in tortoises. This study therefore aimed to calculate reference intervals (RI) for specific species, sexes, and seasons for thyroid hormones and iodine levels in blood of four adult Mediterranean tortoise species and to evaluate possible correlations between thyroid hormones, serum iodine, plasma protein and increased liver and kidney values. Thyroid hormones (total tetraiodothyronine [tT4], free tetraiodothyronine [fT4], total triiodothyronine [tT3], and free triiodothyronine [fT3]) were measured in plasma from adult, healthy Hermann´s (Testudo hermanni, n = 255), spur-thighed (Testudo graeca, n = 89), marginated (Testudo marginata, n = 72), and Russian tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii, n = 30). Species, sex and season specific variations were determined by Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and correlations between plasma thyroid hormones, protein, iodine and increased liver/kidney values were evaluated by Spearman’s rank correlation test. Total T4 did not reveal any species, sex, or seasonal differences (RI 0.102 to 0.455 µg/dL), while seasonal differences were found for fT4 (RI spring 0.624 to 9.012; summer 0.379 to 5.476; fall 0.376 to 5.426 pmol/L). The tT3 levels differed significantly depending on species, season, and the interaction of species x season. Seasonal differences were also found for fT3 and iodine. Several significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05) correlations were detected between the tested analytes, especially positive correlations between tT4 and fT4. These results provide a tool for the evaluation of thyroid hormone levels in Mediterranean tortoises and indicate the influence of season on the thyroid in these animals.</jats:p>

AB  - Forty-five Horsfield's tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii; syn. Agrionemys horfieldii, Russian tortoise) belonging to different owners had decreased appetite and respiratory issues. Twenty-nine tortoises had epiphora, dyspnea, and white necrotic diphtheroid oral plaques (group G1). Ten of the remaining 16 tortoises had serious dehydration, appetite disorder, and depression (G2). The last 6 tortoises had only decreased appetite and moderate conjunctival discharge (G3). During the physical examination of all 45 tortoises, a cytologic sample and an oral swab for herpesvirus and Mycoplasma agassizii PCR testing were taken. In 20 of 29 specimens from G1, in 8 of 16 from G2, and 0 of 6 from G3, the cytologic exam revealed intranuclear acidophilic inclusion bodies, multinucleate cellular syncytia, and further abnormalities caused by herpesviral infection. Moreover, all 45 tested subjects were found to be positive for testudinid herpesvirus 1; 2 were positive for M. agassizii. This prospective study suggests that Horsfield's tortoises with such signs would benefit from this screening procedure, given that it was effective in a significant proportion of infected and symptomatic animals, and no negative effects were seen.

AB  - Abstract The range of Agrionemys horsfieldii in Iran is outlined and known locality records are mapped, including seven new localities from northern and eastern Iran. New data on habitats and population densities in different landscapes are given. Population density varied between 0.7 and 2.15 ind./ha. An historical analysis of the habitat formation and divergence of the Horsfield tortoise on the Iranian Plateau is given. Information on morphology, ecology and parasitology of the populations from the environs of Mazdavand is presented. The morphometric characteristics of two populations were compared and some morphometric indices were found. The possible cooccurrence of Agrionemys horsfieldii and Testudo graeca zarudnyi is discussed. These two species show a preference for different conditions and rarely meet together in the same habitat.

AB  - In spring 2020, a severe disease outbreak with high morbidity and mortality was observed in a collection of 15 Horsfield's tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii). Affected tortoises showed upper respiratory- and gastrointestinal tract signs, including rhinitis and stomatitis. Testudinid herpesvirus 1 (TeHV1) and Mycoplasma spp. were detected by PCR in oral swabs of affected animals. Histological examination of one deceased animal showed intranuclear inclusion bodies typical for herpesvirus infections in liver, spleen and oesophagus. The virus was likely introduced into the collection 2 years earlier by a clinically healthy Horsfield's tortoise that was tested positive for TeHV1 by PCR.

AB  - Based on polymorphism of the 12S rRNA gene and RAPD markers, differentiation of 122 tortoise individuals belonging to the three species of genus Testudo (T. kleinmanni, T. marginata, and T. graeca), six subspecies of T. graeca (T. g. nikolskii, T. g. pallasi, T. g. armeniaca, T. g. zarudnyi, T. g. terrestris, T. g. ibera), and two subspecies of the Central Asian tortoise Agrionenemys horsfieldii (A. h. horsfieldii, A. h. kazakhstanica) was performed. For comparison, 32 known sequences of 12S rRNA gene (392 bp) from tortoises of the two genera inhabiting the territories of Europe, Asia, and Africa were used. In the populations of A. horsfieldii, a total of six haplotypes; including three newly described variants, were identified. In the examined tortoises of the genus Testudo, eleven 12S rRNA haplotypes were identified. One new haplotype was detected in T. kleinmanni. Among the eight subspecies of T. graeca, eight haplotypes were identified, with four newly described ones. The reported RAPD markers generally supported the reconstructions obtained with the use of the mitochondrial marker. Similarly to the 12S rRNA-based reconstructions, two independent clusters included representatives of the two genera, Agrionemys and Testudio. Among the latter, representatives of T. marginata and T. kleinmanni, as well as T. graeca, with high statistical support values, formed two reciprocally monophyletic groups. Compared to the mitochondrial markers, RAPDs more statisticallysignificantly discriminated the sample of T. g. terrestris and the four subspecies, T. g. ibera, T. g. armeniaca, T. g. pallasi, and T. g. nikolskii. In almost all cases except the representatives of T. g. ibera, the representatives of each of four subspecies formed individual subclusters. The geographical haplotype distribution patterns and possible evolutionary scenario of the origin and dispersal of tortoises of the two genera are discussed.

AB  - Indian star tortoise (Geochelone elegans Schoepff, 1795) is a terrestrial herbivorous reptile that is classified under the vulnerable species of IUCN-Red List. The present communication reports the successful management of gastrointestinal parasitism due to co-infection with oxyurids and ascarid nematodes in the captive population of Indian star tortoise maintained at Zoological Garden, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. The diseased tortoise exhibited clinical signs like diarrhea, anorexia, and weight loss. Direct microscopic examination of pooled fecal sample identified the presence of oxyurid and ascarid ova. Therapeutic management involved a two-dose regimen of pyrantel pamoate given in a 2 week interval at a dose rate of 5 mg/kg body weight per orally. Complete parasitological clearance was observed 2 weeks after initiating the therapy without any recurrence. The two-dose pyrantel pamoate protocol was found to be effective in controlling the parasitic burden of captive Indian star tortoise. Chemotherapy can be combined with managemental changes to nullify the possibility of re-infection.

AB  - espanolEl objetivo del estudio fue investigar la presencia de especies aloctonas de tortugas en la naturaleza en Letonia, asi como retirarlas de la naturaleza, segun el "Plan de proteccion de Emys orbicularis en Letonia", declarada oficialmente por el Ministerio de Medio Ambiente de Letonia (Pupiņs y Pupina 2007a). Los metodos de investigacion fueron: 1) campana de informacion y estudio; 2) entrevistas con los habitantes; 3) expediciones de campo, y 4) un estudio de laboratorio sobre la viabilidad de las tortugas encontradas. En el curso de la investigacion fueron registradas por primera vez cinco nuevas especies aloctonas y subespecies de las tortugas; los nuevos datos se obtuvieron en la busqueda de Trachemys scripta elegans en la naturaleza. La mayoria de los animales registrados (80%) fueron retirados de la naturaleza. La educacion de la poblacion se considera de gran importancia ya que las tortugas aloctonas llegan como resultado de la fuga de los amantes de las mascotas y por su introduccion ilegal en la naturaleza. EnglishThe aim of the research was to investigate the presence of allochthonous species of turtles in the nature of Latvia, as well as to withdraw them from the nature according to the "Plan on protection of Emys orbicularis in Latvia", officially approved by the Latvian Ministry of Environment (Pupiņs & Pupiņa 2007a). The methods of the research were: 1) information campaign and survey; 2) interviews with inhabitants; 3) field expeditions; 4) laboratory study of viability of found turtles. In course of research, five new allochthonous species and subspecies of the turtles were recorded for the first time, and new data were obtained about finding Trachemys scripta elegans in the nature of Latvia. Most of the registered animals (80%) were removed from the nature. Since allochthonous turtles get there in the result of escape from pet-lovers and, apparently, illegal introduction into nature by their owners, education of population is of great importance.

AB  - Plasma total calcium, ionised calcium and albumin levels in Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni), spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca), marginated tortoises (Testudo marginata) and Horsfield's tortoises (Testudo horsfieldi) were investigated. The animals were captive adults maintained under natural unfiltered sunlight in the UK with no dietary sources of cholecalciferol. Analysis of total calcium data showed statistically significant seasonal elevations in females in August compared with March (P=0.003), and statistically significant elevations in females compared with males at all sampling points (March P=0.036, June P=0.003 and August P<0.0001). These differences in values became more prominent as the summer progressed. Albumin values did not appear significantly affected by season. However, males had significantly higher albumin levels than females in the August samples. A correlation between total calcium and ionised calcium was confirmed but there was no correlation between total calcium and albumin values. Total calcium levels were a poor indication of ionised calcium levels, which constituted between 18 and 57 per cent of the total calcium value.

        <jats:p>This article provides a classification of morphological features of the Central Asian tortoise species Agrionemys horsfieldii (Gray 1844) distributed in Kashkadarya region. The data presented in the article are based on research materials conducted in Kashkadarya region in 2019-2022. Eleven sites were selected for the study, including biogeocinoses of deserts (260-600m above sea level), foothills(800-1500m above sea level) and mountains(1800-2200m above sea level). The reason, it is expedient to study morphological changes resulting from ecological adaptation in biogeocenoses, because a particular ecological environment leads to the encounter of similar individuals between subspecies. The differences between the morphological characteristics of the samples (n=204) taken over the whole region were then examined by means of mathematical modeling of pholidosis and morphological features. The aim of the study was to study the morphological differences of tortoises found in Kashkadarya region and to distinguish them as different subspecies or one subspecies. During the study, individuals belonging to the genus Agrionemys were returned in 8 of the 11 areas. When we looked at the carpases of A. horsfieldii (Gray 1844) individuals, we found that the distance difference between the 3,6,8 marginales scales was different, and we formed the W6M/W3M, W6M/W8M parameter for biostatistics from them, that this difference could determine the subspecies. And this parameter was analyzed by software XLSTAT done. Geometric morphology was then mathematically modeled using TPS until64 and TPS digetal256 software and analyzed by MorphoJ software.</jats:p>

AB  - This study screened reptiles presented to specialized veterinary practices in Poland for DNA and RNA of six pathogens and evaluated connections between infections and animal husbandry. Four clinics with veterinarians specializing in exotic animal medicine collected swabs from the soft palate, cloaca, and any lesions from reptiles during routine visits. All samples were screened for the presence of herpesvirus, adenovirus, ranavirus, and mycoplasma DNA. Snake samples were also screened for reptarenavirus and nidovirus RNA. A short questionnaire was filled out by the owner(s) that included questions about the animal and its husbandry. Samples were collected from 254 animals; 107 (42.1%) tested positive for at least one pathogen. The most common agents detected were mycoplasmas (29.1% positive) and adenoviruses (10.6% positive); no rana- or reptarenaviruses were detected. Herpes and nidoviruses were each found in a few cases (2 and 13, respectively). Mycoplasmas were most often detected in Russian tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii; 88.9% positive) and green tree pythons (Morelia viridis; 76.9% positive). Adenoviruses were detected primarily in bearded dragons (Pogona vitticeps; 35.2% positive). Nidoviruses were found only in pythons in the genera Python and Morelia. Herpesviruses were detected in green iguanas (Iguana iguana). There was no correlation between husbandry and mycoplasma or virus detection. Although the detection of many of these pathogens corresponds to findings in other countries, several (high rates of mycoplasma-positive snakes and herpesvirus-positive iguanas) were surprising and may reflect specific disease dynamics within Poland.

AB  - Methods of infrared (IR) spectroscopy and circular dichroism (CD) are suitable techniques for detection of proteins structural changes. These methods were used for determinating peculiarities of the secondary structure of serum albumins in some representatives of two classes of reptiles: Horsfield's tortoise (Testudo horsfieldi), water snake (Natrix tessellata) and grass snake (Natrix natrix) and birds: domestic goose (Anser anser), domestic chicken (Gallus domesticus), domestic duck (Anas platyrhyncha) and dove colored (Columba livia). An analysis of IR spectra and spectra obtained by the method of CD of serum albumins of both classes representatives revealed that beta-folding structure and alpha-helical sections that form the alpha-conformation play an important role in conformational structure formation of polypeptide chain and also disordered sites of molecules of these proteins. It was observed that certain redistribution depending on animals species exists, in the formation of secondary structure of serum albumins of the investigated representatives of reptiles and birds classes between the content of beta-folding structure, alpha-helical sections and disordered sites in molecules of these proteins.

AB  - Abstract Selective forces shape sexes differently, with male body proportions facing strong selection to enhance mate searching and male-to-male combat traits, and female fitness being influenced by the ability to assimilate large amounts of nutrients necessary for vitellogenesis (and/or gestation), and their ability to carry the eggs or embryos. We evaluated the sexual dimorphism of body proportion of more than 800 wild steppe tortoises ( Testudo horsfieldii ) in Uzbekistan. The thick, well-developed shell offers protection from predators but pronounced digging habits probably also constrain body shape (e.g. a shell that is dorso-ventrally flattened, although round from a dorsal view helps to penetrate into, and move within the soil). Thus, in this species, natural selection might favour a heavy and flat shell that is «closed» with small openings for appendages. In males, these environmental influences appear to be countered by sexual selection. Compared to females, they weigh less (absolutely and relative to shell dimensions), have longer legs, have shell structure allowing wider movements for their legs, and they walk faster. Males were also able to right themselves more quickly than females did in experimental tests. This quick righting ability is critical because intra-sexual combats frequently result in males being flipped onto their backs and becoming prone to hyperthermia or predation. Females are heavily built, with wide shells (relative to male shells), which may provide space for carrying eggs. From our results, a number of simple hypotheses can be tested on a wide range of chelonian species.

AB  - Understanding of the diversity of species of Cryptosporidium Tyzzer, 1910 in tortoises remains incomplete due to the limited number of studies on these hosts. The aim of the present study was to characterise the genetic diversity and biology of cryptosporidia in tortoises of the family Testudinidae Batsch. Faecal samples were individually collected immediately after defecation and were screened for presence of cryptosporidia by microscopy using aniline-carbol-methyl violet staining, and by PCR amplification and sequence analysis targeting the small subunit rRNA (SSU), Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) and actin genes. Out of 387 faecal samples from 16 tortoise species belonging to 11 genera, 10 and 46 were positive for cryptosporidia by microscopy and PCR, respectively. All samples positive by microscopy were also PCR positive. Sequence analysis of amplified genes revealed the presence of the Cryptosporidium tortoise genotype I (n = 22), C. ducismarci Traversa, 2010 (n = 23) and tortoise genotype III (n = 1). Phylogenetic analyses of SSU, COWP and actin gene sequences revealed that Cryptosporidium tortoise genotype I and C. ducismarci are genetically distinct from previously described species of Cryptosporidium. Oocysts of Cryptosporidium tortoise genotype I, measuring 5.8-6.9 µm × 5.3-6.5 µm, are morphologically distinguishable from C. ducismarci, measuring 4.4-5.4 µm × 4.3-5.3 µm. Oocysts of Cryptosporidium tortoise genotype I and C. ducismarci obtained from naturally infected Russian tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii Gray) were infectious for the same tortoise but not for Reeve's turtles (Mauremys reevesii [Gray]), common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis [Linnaeus]), zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata [Vieillot]) and SCID mice (Mus musculus Linnaeus). The prepatent period was 11 and 6 days post infection (DPI) for Cryptosporidium tortoise genotype I and C. ducismarci, respectively; the patent period was longer than 200 days for both cryptosporidia. Naturally or experimentally infected tortoises showed no clinical signs of disease. Our morphological, genetic, and biological data support the establishment of Cryptosporidium tortoise genotype I as a new species, Cryptosporidium testudinis sp. n., and confirm the validity of C. ducismarci as a separate species of the genus Cryptosporidium.

AB  - Based on intraspecific polymorphism of 12S rRNA gene, genetic variation of isolated populations of the Central Asian tortoise, Agrionemys horsfieldii, was for the first time investigated on a large part of the species distribution range, encompassing Uzbekistan, southern Kazakhstan, and northern and eastern Iran. In 59 tortoises, four haplotypes were discovered, including two (AH1 and AH2), described earlier. Haplotype AH1 was detected in 52 tortoises, inhabiting southern Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Haplotype AH2 was found in four tortoises from the border territory between Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan. Two novel haplotypes, AH3 and AH4, were detected in the three tortoises from Iran. Based on nucleotide substitutions in the 12S rDNA sequence, the possible divergence time between the tortoises from different parts of the range was estimated. Possible pathways of the formation of modern intraspecific groups of A. horsfieldii are discussed.

AB  - На основании полиморфизма гена 12S рРНК и RAPD-маркеров проведена дифференциация 122 черепах, принадлежащих к трем видам рода Testudo (T. kleinmanni, T. marginata и T. graeca), шести подвидам T. graeca (T. g. nikolskii, T. g. pallasi, T. g. armeniaca, T. g. zarudnyi, T. g. terrestris, T. g. ibera) и двум подвидам среднеазиатской черепахи Agrionemys horsfieldii (A. h. horsfieldii, А. h. kazakhstanica). Для сравнения использованы 32 известные последовательности гена 12S рРНК (392 пн) черепах двух родов, обитающих на территории Европы, Азии и Африки. В популяциях A. horsfieldii выявлено шесть гаплотипов, три из которых описаны нами впервые. У исследованных нами черепах рода Testudo обнаружены 11 гаплотипов гена 12S рРНК. Один новый гаплотип выявлен у T. kleinmanni, среди восьми подвидов T. graeca обнаружено восемь гаплотипов, четыре из которых представлены нами впервые. Предлагаемые RAPD-маркеры подтверждают в общем виде реконструкции, полученные при использовании митохондриального маркера. Как и по гену 12S pРНК, два обособленных кластера включают представителей двух родов  Agrionemys и Testudo. Среди последних представители T. marginata и T. kleinmanni, а также T. graeca с высокой надежностью формируют две реципрокно-монофилетические группы. По сравнению с митохондриальным маркером RAPDs более достоверно разделяют выборку T. g. terrestris и четыре подвида: T. g. ibera, T. g. armeniaca, T. g. pallasi, T. g. nikolskii. За исключением представителей T. g. ibera, практически во всех случаях представителям каждого из четырех подвидов соответствуют собственные подкластеры. Обсуждаются особенности географического распределения гаплотипов и возможные эволюционные сценарии происхождения и расселения сухопутных черепах двух родов.

AB  - Using a nearly range-wide sampling, we investigated phylogeographic differentiation and mitochondrial diversity of Testudo horsfieldii, the only tortoise species confined to Central Asia. We identified three major haplotype clades with mainly parapatric distribution that do not correspond well to the currently recognized three subspecies. One clade is restricted to the Fergana Valley and seems to represent a previously overlooked evolutionarily significant unit. Another clade, consisting of several largely parapatrically distributed haplotypes, occurs in the north and the central southern part of the species' range. The third clade, likewise comprising several largely parapatrically distributed haplotypes, was identified from the south- eastern corner of the Caspian Sea in the west, from Afghanistan and Pakistan in the east and from two more northerly sites in western and south-eastern Uzbekistan. It is possible that this clade also occurs in eastern Turkmenistan and adjacent Afghanistan, regions not sampled for the present study. The generally parapatric distribution of individual haplotypes, even within each of the three major clades, suggests advanced lineage sorting, either due to limited dispersal abilities, glacial isolation in distinct local microrefuges or both acting in accord. The localized distribution of endemic haplotypes in the northern and central plains as well as in the mountainous eastern and southern parts of the distribution range supports the existence of multiple microrefuges there. Records of haplotypes of distinct clades in sympatry or close geographic proximity are likely the result of Holocene range expansions. In recent years, thousands of confiscated steppe tortoises were released into the wild. The detected mitochondrial differentiation offers a powerful tool for nature conservation, as a means of determining the geographic origin of confiscated tortoises and selecting suitable reintroduction regions.

AB  - Обобщены сведения по питанию Agrionemys horsfieldii в природе за все время изучения биологии этого вида. Рассмотрены особенности питания черепахи в различных ландшафтах Центральной Азии. Дана характеристика потребления черепахой растительности, животных и минеральных объектов. На территории ареала черепаха употребляет в пищу 167 видов растений, относящихся к 42 семействам. Основную долю в питании составляют эфемеры из семейств Asteraceae, Poaceae, Brassicaceae, Papaveraceaе, Fabaceae, Boraginaceae. По типу пищевой специализации Agrionemys horsfieldii относится ближе к специализированным потребителям, так как проявляет выраженную избирательность в выборе кормовых растений. Предпочитаемые и одновременно обильные виды растений составляют базовые (основн6ые) объекты питания, обеспечивающие стабильное существование популяции. Обсуждается потребление животными токсичных растений. Конкуренция за пищу с домашним скотом происходит только весной в местах с высокой плотностью населения черепахи. Вред, наносимый Agrionemys horsfieldii растениеводству, в настоящее время значительно уменьшился из-за вытеснения черепахи с поливных земель и снижения ее численности в районах богарного земледелия.

The present study is concerned with the examination of thyroid parameters in those tortoisespecies
frequently presented at the veterinary practise. 338 tortoises and turtles were
examined over a period of one year. The examinations included case history, clinical
examinations, diagnosis and determination of fT3, fT4, T3, and T4 levels by way of
electrochemiluminescence immunoassay and sonographic examinations of the thyroid gland
with determination of the thyroid size by measuring.
One of the first steps was to determine the thyroid hormone concentrations of fT3, fT4, T3,
T4 in 103 healthy tortoises and turtles. Subsequently the levels were examined for
dependencies regarding species, age, sex, and season. This revealed significantly higher fT4-
and T4-concentrations in turtles compared to tortoises. A diagnostical dependence regarding
age, sex, and season could not be detected. Accordingly a reference range, defined as 95%
percentile interval, was established for those tortoises frequently presented at the veterinary
practise (Testudo hermanni, Testudo graeca, Testudo marginata, Agrionemys horsfieldii).
In a second step the fT3, fT4, T3, and T4 concentrations of 235 ill tortoises were determined.
The animals were divided according to manner and severity of their illness into three groups
(slightly ill animals, profoundly ill animals, and animals under medication by Allopurinol).
Significant differences were revealed in the thyroid hormone concentrations of healthy
compared to profoundly ill animals. The main parameter for diagnostic use, it became, is
apparently fT3. There is evidence suggesting an increase of this parameter in excess of the
reference range indicates that the animals suffer from a severe illness with possibly fatal
consequences. This test has a high specificity and a comparatively low sensitivity.
At the same time the thyroid glands of 338 tortoises were examined sonographically. Position,
shape, echogenicity and echotexture were described.
The maximum diameter of the thyroid gland was established and put in relation to the body
weight. Dependencies between the size of the thyroid and the state of health or illness on the
one hand and the concentration of thyroid hormones on the other hand were checked. This
showed that animals under medication by Allopurinol frequently feature bigger thyroid glands
than healthy animals. A correlation between thyroid hormone concentration and thyroid-size
could not be proven.
The results of this study are compared to evidence from to literary references and the
diagnostical applicability is discussed.

AB  - Herbivorous vertebrates of arid regions are frequently faced with inadequate food quality, quantity or both. The time and energy devoted to foraging is vital to balancing their energy budgets. For desert ectotherms, a low metabolism should be advantageous, reducing their total energy requirement, but extreme ambient temperatures can strongly constrain these animals' activity periods. We provide the first data on the activity budgets, foraging behaviour and diet of a highly abundant, desertdwelling, herbivorous ectotherm, the steppe tortoise Testudo horsfieldi. Extreme climatic conditions of Central Asia limit steppe tortoise's activity to only three months per year. They remain inactive most of their ''active season'' (90%), and spend very little time foraging (15 min per day). This suggests that steppe tortoises can satisfy their energy requirements with modest feeding efforts. Interestingly, steppe tortoises avoid feeding on grass species and feed mostly on plant species that are usually highly toxic to mammals. This result suggests that steppe tortoises and ungulates do not compete for food.

AB  - The species and subspecies of W Palaearctic tortoises include six, which are widespread in southern Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, and four with restricted ranges in the Mediterranean region. The Central Asian Testudo (Agrionemys) horsfieldii GRAY overlaps with Testudo graeca zarudnyiNIKOLSKY in Iran and Afghanistan. The distributions of the remainder border the Mediterranean Sea. Their survival is threatened directly or indirectly by human activity over many years and include habitat destruction (urbanization, touristic development, road-building, scrubland fires and agriculture), bulk pet and food trade collection for export to NW Europe (Testudo graeca graeca L., Testudo graeca ibera PAL-LAS, Testudo hermanni hermanni GMELIN, T. (A.) horsfieldii and sometimes Testudo marginata SCHOEPFF), isolation of populations with restricted ranges (Testudo hermanni robertmertensiWERMUTH, Testudo (Pseudotestudo) kleinmanni LORTET, T. marginata and Testudo graeca floweri BODENHEIMER), and desertification, especially in the Saharan encroachment zone of northern Africa from wood burning, animal grazing and rainfall decrease (T. g. graeca and T. (P.) kleinmanni). A circum-Mediterranean investigation would establish the population status of all species and their habitats. Countries of the Council of Europe and European Economic Community by ratifying C.I.T.E.S. (Washington Convention 1973) have established the extent of the bulk trade. This should only be allowed in captive-bred animals which, like other domestic pets, could be commercially farmed, probably by necessity in the Mediterranean bioclimatic zone.

En avril 2019, 44 tortues (Testudo spp.) ont ete prelevees par ecouvillon oro-pharynge et rincage nasal dans un refuge du sud-ouest de la France et des reactions en chaine par polymerase (PCR) ont ete effectuees afin de rechercher la presence d’ADN de TeHV et de M. agassizii. Les TeHV et M. agassizii ont ete detectes chez 6,8% et 59,1% des individus respectivement, avec un taux de co-infection de 4,5%. Le sequencage a mis en evidence la presence de TeHV-3 uniquement, ainsi qu’une souche de M. agassizii. Les TeHV ont surtout ete detectes chez Testudo hermanni alors que Testudo horsfieldii est l’espece la plus infectee par M. agassizii avec une prevalence de 100%. Aucune correlation entre la detection de l’agent infectieux et l’expression de signes cliniques n’a pu etre confirmee.

AB  - <jats:p>The harvesting of the Central Asian tortoise has been a longstanding practice in Uzbekistan. Throughout the 1930s–1950s, this species was harvested to feed farm livestock and shepherd dogs, and during the World War II, tortoise meat was used to provide additional nutrition to the people. The 1960s marked the start of commercial trade in tortoises. The annual volumes of legal harvesting of wild tortoises started to grow in the late 1990s, and reached 85 thousand specimens per year by 2017. The size of the populations at regular harvesting locations has dropped, and their gender and age composition has changed. The CITES export quota for tortoises bred in captivity was increased in 2018–2019 without valid justification, although small breeding centers have no capacity to breed the manifested quantities of animals. Consequently, Uzbekistan currently exports ranched individuals as well as young wild tortoises, mis-declared as bred in captivity. The export of Central Asian tortoises from Uzbekistan should be suspended temporarily until an expert assessment of the situation is made, and penalties for poaching these animals should be made more severe.</jats:p>

AB  - The development objective of the 1000 Electricity Transmission and Trade Project for Central Asia and South Asia is to create the conditions for sustainable electricity trade between the Central Asia countries of Tajikistan and Kyrgyz Republic and the South Asian countries of Afghanistan and Pakistan, in order to alleviate power supply shortages in the South Asian countries and enhance sector and budget revenues in the Central Asian countries. Some of the negative impacts include: (i) audible noise will be generated by most of converter and electrode equipment during operation; (ii) exposure to electro Magnetic Fields (EMF) and radio interferences from the converter and electrode station equipment; (iii) improper design of these facilities pose risk to workers’ health and safety; (iv) oil spills and leaks from the transformers, reactors and capacitors; (iv) risk of soil and water pollution from construction activities; (v) dust and noise from construction activities; (vi) waste generation and disposal; (vii) impacts on biodiversity, including red book species as steppe tortoise; and (viii) impact on soil and groundwater quality. Some of the mitigation measures include: (i) to design equipment that generate low sound levels; (ii) adequate spacing between the equipment and fencing/boundary wall or right of way. International standards on radio interferences will also be complied with; (iii) water supply facilities including facilities for firefighting and cooling; (iii) to design oil containment and recuperation systems around all transformers, reactors and capacitors; (iv) implementation of soil and pollution control measures; (v) maintenance of construction equipment and vehicles; (vi) proper collection and disposal of waste in the local municipal waste disposal facilities; (vii) to follow the special biodiversity management plan for Central Asian tortoise; and (viii) regular maintenance of oil containment facilities and monitoring.

AB  - Thyroid hormones and the factors influencing them are rarely studied in tortoises. This study therefore aimed to calculate reference intervals (RI) for thyroid hormones and iodine concentrations by species, sexes, and seasons in four species of adult Mediterranean tortoises (Testudo spp.) and to evaluate possible correlations between plasma thyroid hormones, serum iodine, plasma protein, and increased liver and kidney values. Thyroid hormones (total tetraiodothyronine [tT4], free tetraiodothyronine [fT4], total triiodothyronine [tT3], and free triiodothyronine [fT3]) were measured in plasma from adult, healthy Hermann's (Testudo hermanni, n = 255), spur-thighed (Testudo graeca, n = 89), marginated (Testudo marginata, n = 72), and Russian tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii, n = 30). Species, sex, and seasonal variations were determined by Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and correlations between thyroid hormones, protein, iodine, and increased liver/kidney values were evaluated by Spearman's rank correlation test. Total T4 did not reveal any species, sex, or seasonal differences (RI: 0.102–0.455 µg/dl), while seasonal differences were found for fT4 (RI: spring 0.624–9.012; summer 0.379–5.476; fall 0.376–5.426 pmol/L). The tT3 concentrations differed significantly depending on species, season, and the interaction of species × season. Seasonal differences were also found for fT3 and iodine. Several significant (P ≤ 0.05) correlations were detected between the analytes, including a positive correlation between tT4 and fT4. These results provide a tool for the evaluation of thyroid hormone concentrations in Mediterranean tortoises and confirm the influence of season on thyroid function in these animals.

AB  - Gegenstand und Ziel: Erstellung von 20 Blutparametern in Deutschland gehaltener mediterraner Landschildkroten und Vergleich der erhaltenen Parameter zwischen vier unterschiedlichen Landschildkrotenspezies. Material und Methoden: Bei 61 mediterranen, in Deutschland gehaltenen Landschildkroten wurden nach Blutentnahme aus der dorsalen Kokzygealvene hamatologische und blutchemische Referenzwerte von 20 Parametern erstellt. Die Untersuchung erstreckte sich auf Nachzuchttiere oder langer als drei Jahre im Besitz befindliche Tiere aus funf kontrollierten Bestanden. Alle Probanden wurden im Fruhjahr bis Spatsommer im Freiland gehalten und hielten regelmasig Winterschlaf. Die Futterung der Schildkroten erfolgte ausschlieslich mit pflanzlicher Kost. Die 61 klinisch unauffalligen Landschildkroten gehorten den Spezies Testudo marginata (Breitrandschildkrote; n = 16), Testudo graeca (Maurische Landschildkrote; n = 15), Testudo hermanni (Griechische Landschildkrote; n = 22) und Testudo horsfieldii (Russische Steppenschildkrote; n = 8) an. Ergebnisse: Median, Minimal- und Maximalwerte, sowie p-Werte wurden fur Hamatokrit, Alanin-Aminotransferase, Aspartat-Aminotransferase, Glutamat-Dehydrogenase, alkalische Phosphatase, Kreatinkinase, Harnsaure, Harnstoff, Cholesterin, Glukose, Fruktosamin, Gesamtbilirubin, Gesamteiweis, Albumin, Cholinesterase, Natrium, Kalium, Gesamtkalzium, ionisiertes Kalzium und anorganisches Phosphat ermittelt. Schlussfolgerung und klinische Relevanz: Bei 10 der untersuchten 20 Parameter konnten statistisch signifikante speziesspezifische Unterschiede festgestellt werden. Die Ergebnisse weisen darauf hin, dass bei der Interpretation der Blutparameter so genannter „mediterraner Landschildkroten“ unbedingt eine Speziesdifferenzierung stattfinden sollte.

AB  - Herpesviruses are found in free-living and captive chelonian populations, often in association with morbidity and mortality. To date, all known chelonian herpesviruses fall within the subfamily <i>Alphaherpesvirinae</i>. We detected a novel herpesvirus in 3 species of chelonians: a captive leopard tortoise (<i>Stigmochelys pardalis</i>) in western TX, USA; a steppe tortoise (<i>Testudo</i> [<i>Agrionemys</i>] <i>horsfieldii</i>) found near Fort Irwin, CA, USA; and 2 free-living, three-toed box turtles (<i>Terrapene mexicana triunguis</i>) found in Forest Park, St. Louis, MO. The leopard tortoise was coinfected with the tortoise intranuclear coccidian and had clinical signs of upper respiratory tract disease. The steppe tortoise had mucopurulent nasal discharge and lethargy. One of the three-toed box turtles had no clinical signs; the other was found dead with signs of trauma after being observed with blepharedema, tympanic membrane swelling, cervical edema, and other clinical signs several weeks prior to death. Generally, the branching order of the turtle herpesviruses mirrors the divergence patterns of their hosts, consistent with codivergence. Based on phylogenetic analysis, this novel herpesvirus clusters with a clade of viruses that infect emydid hosts and is likely of box turtle origin. Therefore, we suggest the name terrapene alphaherpesvirus 3 (TerAHV3) for the novel virus. This virus also has the ability to host-jump to tortoises, and previously documented herpesviral morbidity tends to be more common in aberrant hosts. The relationship between clinical signs and infection with TerAHV3 in these animals is unclear, and further investigation is merited.
