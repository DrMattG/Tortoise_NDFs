AB  - Herpesviruses are important pathogens in tortoises and turtles, yet little is known about the epidemiology of these viruses. We analyzed herpesviruses detected by PCR in samples from captive chelonians in Europe according to virus strain, host species, year and season in which the animal was tested, and country in which the animal was kept. A total of 4,797 samples submitted to a diagnostic laboratory in Europe between January 2016 and December 2020 were evaluated. Of these, 312 (6.50%) were positive for herpesviruses. The types most commonly found were testudinid herpesvirus (TeHV)1 (143 positive, 45.83%) and TeHV3 (153 positive, 49.04%), but also included TeHV2 (1 positive, 0.32%), TeHV4 (3 positive, 0.96%), Terrapene herpesvirus 1 (7 positive, 2.24%), Trachemys herpesvirus 1 (2 positive, 0.64%), and three previously undescribed herpesviruses (0.96%). Herpesviruses were detected in chelonians in the families Testudinidae, Emydidae, Geoemydidae, and in the suborder Pleurodira. Among the species for which 100 samples or more were available, the highest proportions of positive samples (positivity rates) were found in samples from Horsfield's tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii) (14.96%), and radiated tortoises (Astrochelys radiata) (14.05%). Among tortoises (Testudinidae), viruses were most often detected in the spring, while in emydid turtles (Emydidae) they were most often detected in the summer. A comparison of the positivity rates according to country showed significant differences, with the highest rate in samples from Italy (16.01%). This study indicated possible differences in herpesvirus positivity rates depending on host species, virus strain, year of sampling, season, and country of origin. It provides useful information in further understanding fluctuations in infection rates as well as in helping to guide decision making for herpesvirus diagnostics in chelonian patients. It also provides evidence for the international dispersal of herpesviruses with their hosts through international trade.

AB  - THE International Medical Congress which it is proposed to hold in London in the beginning of August will be the seventh of its kind. The previous meetings have been held biennially in the principal university towns of the Continent. At the last meeting in Amsterdam in 1879, a general wish was expressed that the next should be in England, and the wish having been informally communicated to the Presidents of the College of Physicians and the College of Surgeons, they called a meeting of presidents or other delegates of all the Univerities, Medical Corporations, Public Medical Services, and the Medical Societies. The proposal to hold the Congress in London was heartily agreed to, and an Executive Committee was appointed under whose direction, and, especially, by the energy of the General Secretary, Mr. MacCormack, a very large scheme has been arranged for the discussion of the most interesting questions in all the divisions of the Medical Sciences. The Meetings will be held in fifteen sections, in rooms of most of which the use has been granted by the University of London, the Royal Academy, and all the learned Societies at Burlington House. Others have been engaged at Willis's Rooms. The officers and councils of the several sections include, with very few exceptions, all the chief and most active teachers and workers in the several subjects of medical science and practice, not in London alone, but in all the universities and great towns in the United Kingdom. In so far as general consent to the design of the Congress may be regarded as a promise of success, all looks well, and the agreement of our own countrymen is well matched by the assurances of co-operation already received from a large number of the most distinguished medical investigators and practitioners in both the Old World and the New. About 4000 invitations were issued, and it is expected that the roll of members will include at least 2000 names. Of course there are large arrangements for receptions and various hospitalities, and for making London as agreeable and instructive as may be in August; but if the design in the programme of the Congress be fairly fulfilled, a great quantity of hard and useful scientific work will be well done.

From the time of existence of the Ogzi-Kichik population to the Present, noticeable changes (decrease of the shell length, its height and convexity and changes in the proportions of some plates of the shell) have occurred in the shell morphology of this species. These changes, probably, reflect intensification of the burrowing adaptations connected with the aridization of the climate in the Southern Tajikistan during the mentioned historical period.</jats:p>

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the relationships between total calcium and phosphorus and ionised calcium and phosphorus values in clinically healthy tortoises.



Methods: Jugular blood samples were obtained from 25 tortoises, as part of a health screen of the population. These comprised Hermann’s tortoises, Testudo hermanni boettgeri, spur-thighed tortoises, Testudo graeca ibera, marginated tortoises, Testudo marginata, and horsfield tortoises, Testudo horsfieldi. Plasma from these samples were analysed for total calcium, ionised calcium and phosphorus levels. These samples were taken in the immediate posthibernation period, before the onset of reproductive activity.



Results: Females exhibited statistically significantly higher levels of phosphorus. Ionised calcium and total calcium levels were elevated in females compared with males, but this was not statistically significant. Females did have statistically significantly higher calculated solubility indexes and statistically significantly lower ratios compared with males.



Clinical Significance: This study has provided an insight into the ratios and solubility indexes in tortoises, and this information may lead to further understanding of the significance of these parameters in chelonians.

AB  - In April 2002 – 2005, the feeding patterns of Agrionemys horsfieldii were studied in four different landscapes in Uzbekistan. At the four sites, with the combined area no less than 5 ha, 43 plant species from 17 families were recorded as forming the tortoise diet. The proportion of plant species and gill mushrooms consumed by the tortoise at these sites varied from 42 to 59% with highest feeding preferences was given to species from families Brassicaceae, Papaveraceae, Fabaceae, Poaceae. Some tortoises preferred species ( Anisantha tectorum , Hypecoum parviflorum , Leptaleum filifolium ) and these dominated in food in several communities while animals and other non-vegetable objects were rarely consumed (~2%). Spearman’s rank correlation between the level of availability of a plant species in landscapes and the proportion of its consumption by the tortoise was near to 0 in many cases and we are able to prove that the tortoise should be seen as a selective consumer (PSI = 0.22) rather than as a generalist. A number of species dominating in plant communities were not, or rarely, eaten and among these are plants containing alkaloids and ethers, as well as species with harsh fibers and thorny spikes. In each community there were three or five species constituting the base of the diet (63 – 81%) that sustained the population. The base part of the diet constituted the species which had both high availability in the community and a high index of electivity (Jacob’s index > 0.6). The tortoise’s habitat in arid and waterless desert landscapes requires high rates of water consumption which comes from its food: for this reason, tortoises prefer to eat species with high moisture content, even including some poisonous ones. However, it is quite possible that the consumption of poisonous plants also achieves antihelminthic prophylactics.

AB  - From both the point of view of a person seeking a pet and from a conversation perspective Russian tortoises are one of the worst possible candidates available from the wild-caught reptile pet trade. Yet, for a variety of political and economic reasons this small tortoise has become one of the most commonly marketed species. Since the 1970s well over one million wild-caught adult Russian tortoises have been imported into the U.S. alone. Probably less than one or two percent of these are alive today. Testudo (Agrionemys) horsfieldii, the Russian tortoise (Figure 1), is distributed throughout much of central Asia from northern and eastern Iran, Afghanistan, northern Pakistan, and northwest China, to the southern territory of the former Soviet Union, and throughout various ex-Soviet republics Kazakhstan, Kirgizia, Tajikistan, Turkmenia and Uzbekistan (Figure 2; Iverson, 1992). Despite this seemingly extensive distribution, much of this area consists of climates, habitats and elevations of either marginal use or unsuited for these xeric tortoises. Based on Iverson’s distribution map for this species these tortoises appear to be mostly limited to sites in valleys along major rivers. The climatic extremes result in abbreviated periods of annual activity; in some cases this can be less than two months (Atayev, 1985), and protracted periods of estivation and hibernation. In much of central Asia, estivation starts in May–June with the desiccation of ephemeral vegetation. In some areas estivation extends directly into hibernation and the tortoises remain inactive for three-quarters of the year or more. Lagarde et al. (2003) demonstrated these tortoises were active only three months of the year, and during this active season they were inactive 90% of the time. Adult tortoises spent less than 15 minutes a day foraging. They do not feed on grass and typically forage on plants highly toxic to grazing mammals, thus avoiding competition with them. Three subspecies have been recognized but subspecific characteristics overlap geographically and detailed genetic studies and statistical analysis would be useful to determine the

AB  - The steppe tortoise (Testudo horsfieldi) is probably the most widespread and abundant of all living terrestrial tortoises, but paradoxically, this chelonian as been studied only superficially. Steppe tortoise populations are declining rapidly as a result of massive harvesting for the pet trade and extensive disruption of their habitat by intensive agriculture. Thus, it is urgent to acquire accurate information on major life-history traits. Our 5-year field study at the Djeiron Ecocenter in the Republic of Uzbekistan indicates that steppe tortoises usually remain buried in one place for over 9 months, which helps them cope with the extreme environmental conditions that occur in summer, fall, and winter. After emerging in late winter, steppe tortoises have less than 3 months in spring to forage to obtain the fuel needed for growth and reproduction, and replenish the body reserves necessary for the subsequent 9 months of total starvation. The mating period occurred between the end of March and mid-April and ...

AB  - The polymerase chain reaction with arbitrary primers (RAPD-PCR) was used to study intraspecific variation in Mediterranean turtle Testudo graeca, which is represented by the Dagestan (T. g. pallasi) and Nikolskii (T. g. nikolskii) subspecies in Russia. To study the phylogenetic relationships, the RAPD variation was also compared in two other T. graeca subspecies (T. g. ibera and T. g. terrestris), two closely related Testudo species (T. kleinmanni and T. marginata), and Central Asian turtle Agrionemys horsfieldii. Parameters of RAPD variation showed that the sample from different geographical regions of Dagestan was more polymorphic and heterogeneous than that from Central Asia. The two samples differed in the mean number of RAPD fragments N (48.76 vs. 40.40), number of polymorphic fragments P (78.7 vs. 32.3), and within-group similarity index APS (0.607 vs. 0.784). In T. g. pallasi, no significant difference in N, P, or APS was observed between samples from different localities of Dagestan or between groups of turtles with four- or five-clawed forelegs. A dendrogram of genetic similarity between the species and subspecies under study contained two clusters, one comprising all A. horsfieldii individuals and the other, all turtles of the genus Testudo. In the latter, T. marginata and T. kleinmanni showed higher similarity to each other than to T. graeca. The four T. graeca subspecies clustered separately from each other with a high reliability, T. g. nikolskii and T. g ibera (Turkey) being more similar to each other than to T. g. terrestris or T. g. pallasi. The possible causes of the presence of four claws on forelegs of turtles from Dagestan and the relationships among members of the genus Testudo were discussed.

The introduction of the Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) in Europe in the 1980s resulted in expansion of the swimbladder nematode Anguillicola crassus which soon invaded not only populations of the European eel (A. anguilla), but also other local fish. The raccoon (Procyon lotor) is native to North America. It is the specific host of Strongyloides procyonis and Baylisascaris procyonis. More than 90 species of wild and domestical bird and mammal species, including humans, have been infected with B. procyonis larvae. The larvae enter various organs of paratenic hosts, particularly the central nervous system and eye, causing severe diseases and death. Asthworthius sidemi--a blood-succking, abomasal nematode, a specific parasite of the Asiatic sika deer (Cervus nippon) and sambar deer (C. unicolor)--was first introduced with its hosts into countries adjacent to Poland. A. sidemi is especially dangerous to the European bison (Bison bonasus) which is its new host. The bison populations, in both Bialowieza Primaeval Forest and the Bieszczady Mts, sometimes show a 100% prevalence and mass infection intensity. Imported animals, sold in pet shops or available from private breeding firms, often carry non-native parasites. For example, the red-eared tortoise (Trachemys scripta elegans) and Afgan tortoise (Agrionemys horsfieldii) carry nematodes Angusticaecum holopterum, Tachygonetria lobata and T. robusta. Migratory birds in their wintering grounds are often infected with parasites which are usually not constant components of the native fauna, but sometimes nematodes could find a suitable conditions to complete their life cycle. E.g. Cyathosoma microspiculum, species specific to cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) and previously recorded only from Asia and the Asian-European boudary, was able complete the life cycle in Poland. The increasingly frequent travels to countries with different climatic conditions contribute to introduction of non-native nematodes: Dirofilaria immitis--in dogs, D. repens or Ancylostoma brasiliense--in humans.

AB  - A complex wide-range study on the haemoproteid parasites of chelonians was carried out for the first time. Altogether, 811 samples from four tortoise species from an extensive area between western Morocco and eastern Afghanistan and between Romania and southern Syria were studied by a combination of microscopic and molecular-genetic methods. Altogether 160 Haemoproteus-positive samples were gathered in the area between central Anatolia and eastern Afghanistan. According to variability in the cytochrome b gene, two monophyletic evolutionary lineages were distinguished; by means of microscopic analysis it was revealed that they corresponded to two previously described species-Haemoproteus anatolicum and Haemoproteus caucasica. Their distribution areas overlap only in a narrow strip along the Zagros Mts. range in Iran. This fact suggests the involvement of two different vector species with separated distribution. Nevertheless, no vectors were confirmed. According to phylogenetic analyses, H. caucasica represented a sister group to H. anatolicum, and both of them were most closely related to H. pacayae and H. peltocephali, described from South American river turtles. Four unique haplotypes were revealed in the population of H. caucasica, compared with seven haplotypes in H. anatolicum. Furthermore, H. caucasica was detected in two tortoise species, Testudo graeca and Testudo horsfieldii, providing evidence that Haemoproteus is not strictly host-specific to the tortoise host species.

AB  - In a population of about 130 tortoises, consisting mainly of Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) and Four-toed tortoises (Agrionemys horsfieldii), 50% of the reptiles died within 3 months in autumn 1987. Post mortem analysis of 5 necropsied turtles revealed thick, caseous coatings in the upper digestive tract, hepatomegaly and enteritis. By microbiological examination a lot of ubiquitous bacteria could be isolated. By electron microscopy of concentrated and negatively stained gut specimens herpes virus particles were found in two Hermann's tortoises and one Four-toed tortoise. Isolation experiments in embryonic turtle tissue cultures showed no evidence of a cytopathogenic agent. The results are discussed in respect of their importance for the high mortality observed in the population of mediterranean land turtles.

AB  - ACCORDING to our contemporary l'Électricite, M. Exner of Vienna has discovered that a bismuth-antimony pair immersed in a gas incapable of acting chemically on either of these metals yields no current when one junction is heated. Also that if two bars of copper are soldered together to form a “pair” no current is produced when either junction is heated in air (as would be expected in a circuit of one metal), not even when both strips are exposed to the action of chlorine; but that if one strip only is exposed to chlorine gas and then one junction be warmed a thermo-electric current is set up. According to Exner therefore, all so-called thermo-electric currents are due to chemical action. It would be easy for some of our ardent young physicists to put to the test this very remarkable announcement, and see whether it is Herr Exner, or all the authorities on thermo-electricity from Seebeck to Tait, on whom we are to rely for the facts.

AB  - During 1991 and 1992, ecological observations of Cental Asian tortoise, Testudo horsfieldii Gray, in the wild were carried out in Huocheng Nature Reserve, Huocheng County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Huocheng County is the only distributon area found in China. This paper summarized the results of the studies.1.Study Area and Methods: The study area lied in 80°42.75'-81°4.6'E, 44°3.5'-44°17'N. The Cental Asian tortoise lived in the arid environment form 650 to 1 100m above sea leval, the average temperature was 9. 34℃, rainfall was 220mm, the dorminant vegetations in this region was the compound of ephemerophytelamb's-quarsdters-artimisa.The highed dendsity area of tortoise-Kantumandun was selected as the long-term study area. More than fifty tortoises collected from the wild were put into a pen of 20000m2 area in the habital of T. horsfieldi, the pen was digged with a border of 30cm depth prevented tortoises from running away. The body temperature of 5-10tortoises, substrate temperature, air temperature and illumination strength were written down every hours in active period of tortoises. The habitat selection and vegetation vegetation were surveyed with sample method. Food habit and reproductive behavior were obtained with field trackking,captive observation and raising methods, the population density was censused with line transect method.2.

AB  - Ranaviral disease in amphibians has been studied intensely during the last decade, as associated mass-mortality events are considered to be a global threat to wild animal populations. Several studies have also included other susceptible ectothermic vertebrates (fish and reptiles), but only very few cases of ranavirus infections in lizards have been previously detected. In this study, we focused on clinically suspicious lizards and tested these animals for the presence of ranaviruses. Virological screening of samples from lizards with increased mortality and skin lesions over a course of four years led to the detection of ranaviral infections in seven different groups. Affected species were: brown anoles (Anolis sagrei), Asian glass lizards (Dopasia gracilis), green anoles (Anolis carolinensis), green iguanas (Iguana iguana), and a central bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps). Purulent to ulcerative-necrotizing dermatitis and hyperkeratosis were diagnosed in pathological examinations. All animals tested positive for the presence of ranavirus by PCR and a part of the major capsid protein (MCP) gene of each virus was sequenced. Three different ranaviruses were isolated in cell culture. The analyzed portions of the MCP gene from each of the five different viruses detected were distinct from one another and were 98.4-100% identical to the corresponding portion of the frog virus 3 (FV3) genome. This is the first description of ranavirus infections in these five lizard species. The similarity in the pathological lesions observed in these different cases indicates that ranaviral infection may be an important differential diagnosis for skin lesions in lizards.

AB  - This thesis examines clinically relevant
 haematological and biochemical parameters in healthy European tortoises
 including Testudo hermanni,
 Testudo graeca,
 Testudo marginata
 and Testudo horsfieldii.  A total of 180 blood samples were taken
 from 60 tortoises kept in Germany
 and analyzed during three seasons of the year (spring, summer and fall).
 Every animal
 underwent a general examination, was weighed and marked for identification
 prior to taking blood samples exclusively from the vena coccygealis dorsalis.
 Twenty-one
 blood parameters were examined: Alanine aminotransferase,  aspartate aminotransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase,
 alkaline phosphatase, creatine
 kinase, cholinesterase, uric acid, blood urea
 nitrogen (BUN), cholesterol, total bilirubin,
 glucose, fructosamine, total protein, albumin,
 sodium, chloride, total calcium, ionized calcium, phosphate, potassium and
 packed cell volume (PCV).  Few
 studies on glutamate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, sodium, chloride, ionized calcium and
 potassium in the European tortoises exist. Studies on cholinesterase and fructosamine are non-existent to date.
 The blood
 samples were statistically analyzed as a combined total of all samples taken
 as well as according to species, gender, age and season.
 For the tested population following mean
 values were found: Alanine aminotransferase
 1,2 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase
 25,7 U/L, glutamate dehydrogenase 1,6 U/L, alkaline

 significant degree. Cholesterol, sodium and total calcium showed
 evidence of statistically significant gender specific differences. Aspartate aminotransferase,
 urea, total protein, albumin and chloride showed evidence of gender specific
 differences as well, but not statistically significant. Cholinesterase, however, showed a statistically
 significant age related disparity. Packed cell volume, aspartate aminotransferase,
 alkaline phosphatase, creatine
 kinase, cholesterol, glucose, total protein,
 sodium, chloride, ionized blood calcium, total calcium and phosphate also
 demonstrated differences but none of statistic relevance. Packed cell volume, alanine
 aminotransferase, aspartate
 aminotransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase,
 cholinesterase, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, sodium, chloride,

AB  - The Tibetan Plateau was visited annually between 1988 and 2001, mostly for periods of 3-4 months each year, sometimes for 4-7 weeks and once, in 1995, for 7 consecutive months. Except for a single summer, all visits took place in autumn, winter and spring. As logistics are difficult in this region, transportation was mainly by yaks or horses, accompanied and helped by monks who also acted as mediators between the local people and the visitors. Main objectives were to experience cultures relatively untouched by modem society, as well as studying ungulates and birds. Over the years, observations accumulated which were often at variance with presentations in field guides, handbooks and papers dealing with the region. Some of these observations are presented in this overview. The Tibetan Plateau covers about 2.5 million km² (Fig. 1), of which 50% exceeds 4500 m above sea level (85% above 3000 m). Of 810 lakes, 600 are to be found in the central range, the Chang Tang. Some lakes are huge, as the Kokonor Lake in the north (at 3200 m above sea level, 4400 km2). Most lakes have substantially decreased in size in recent years due to a decline in precipitation, often becoming salt along the way. Borders of fresh water lakes abound with waterbirds during migration and winter. Less than 1% of the Tibetan Plateau is presently cultivated, although locally – as in the Quadam Basin – this area has increased due to enforced settlement. Cultivated land is mostly confined to areas below 3300 m, but reaches an altitude of 4400 m near Yarlung Tsangpo. Permafrost is typical of the northern regions, penetrating as deep as 155 m; only the top layer of 50-60 cm becomes defrosted during summer. More than 30% of the Chang Tsang consists of Alpine- and steppe vegetations, dominated by Slipa species and Carex moorcroftii. The land climate is harsh, and even extreme above 4500 m (-40°C quite normal). In Shigatse and Lhasa temperatures are rather moderate compared to the Chang Tang. Wintering conditions in Ladakh are especially harsh because settlements and lakes are situated at higher altitudes than elsewhere in the region; temperatures of -50 to -60°C in January and February are not unusual. At similar heights in Tibet, the climate is equally harsh but as villages and lakes on average are situated at lower altitudes, living conditions are less harsh and many lakes are not (completely) frozen, offering opportunities for wintering waterbirds. Apart from extreme coldness, dust storms are typical of the region. On average, the local Bhuddist peoples live in harmony with their environment, as evident from the absence of hunting and fishing and the holy status of several lakes and bird species. Flowever, the “untamed” Goloks in the central Chang Tang are fierce hunters, responsible for almost exterminating species like Brown Bear Ursus arctos, and seriously depleting populations of Wild Yak Bos grunniens, Argali Ovis ammon, Bharal Pseudois nayaur, Tibetan Gazelle Procapra picticaudata, Chiru Pantholops hodgsoni and Urial Ovis orientalis. These depredations were especially devastating during the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution in the 1970s and 1980s. Although large areas are nowadays officially protected nature reserves (some as large as 334,000 km2), at the same time the Chinese government encourages settlers to invade the area. Where formerly wild animals populated the region, their stocks are now much depleted and cultivated animals like sheep and goats (30 million by 1990) and domesticated yaks (12 million ditto) have taken over. The presence and relative abundance of raptors in Tibetan and Ladakh parts of the Tibetan Plateau have been summarised in Table 1. It should be noted that observations during summer are limited to a single year, that conditions for observation are often difficult and that birds were only a sideline of research while staying in the area. Species-specific details are provided below. Black Kite Milvus migrans: passage migrant in large numbers in Tibet and China, with flocks of tens staying temporarily along rivers. Pallas’s Fish Eagle Haliaeetus leucoryphus: only observed in the Tibetan part of the range, i.e. an adult and juvenile on 3 October 1998 at Tar Tso (31°10'N, 84°0), a juvenile on 10 April 1995 at Am Co and an adult accompanied by a juvenile on 4 September 1995 at the Manasarovar Lake. Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus: adult singles were recorded near Lhasa on 6 January 1993, and on 4 April near Paiku Tso (29°N, 85°50’). Himalaya Griffon Gyps himalayensis and Eurasian Griffon G. fulvus: both species were heavily persecuted in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution, as in the Tibetan district of Gansu. Both are still in dire straits. In recent years, a slight increase in the number of breeding pairs has been noted, especially in the vicinity of Lhasa and Shigatse (but not in Gansu). This resulted from a change in the attitude of the Chinese government towards the existence and use of open-air burial sites (where vultures used to be fed with the corpses of the deceased); mercilessly destroyed in the late 20th century, some have now been re-opened, as in Lhasa. Red-headed Vulture Sarcogyps calvus: although formerly present on the Tibetan Plateau, it is now a rare bird, not showing an improvement in status compared with both Gyps species. Northern Goshawk Accipiter gentilis: mostly seen during migration. Birds passing in March and April are often harassed by territorial Sakers. White-eyed Buzzard Butastur teesa: twice recorded on Chang Tang (once dead, on 2 October 1992 near Nyalam, just north of Kathmandu, another in October 2001 in the same area). A third bird was seen on 18 October 1998 near Lunggar (31 °N, 84°O). Upland Buzzard Buteo hemilasius, Long-legged Buzzard B. rufinus and Common Buzzard B. buteo: the presence of these species is correlated with the distribution and abundance of pikas (notably Ocholona pusilla and O. curzionae). Large numbers of pikas are associated with ditto numbers of voles, providing excellent feeding conditions for buzzards. Rough-legged Buzzard Buteo lagopus: more common in winter than depicted in field guides and handbooks (as holds for many other wintering species). Steppe Eagle Aquila nipalensis: like buzzards depending upon presence and abundance of pikas, but also recorded at concentrations of waterbirds. Spotted Eagle Aquila clanga: commoner in winter than usually depicted in guides and handbooks. Preference for areas with large concentrations of waterbirds. Golden Eagle Aquila chrysaetos: on two nests in the Chang Tang region remains of the Steppe Tortoise Agrionemys horsfeldi were collected. Although this prey species is commonly captured (and killed by dropping it from great heights on rocks below) in eastern Kazakhstan, it is apparently absent from the Chang Tang (as confirmed by the local people). Eurasian Kestrel Falco tinnunculus: a ubiquitous species, occurring everywhere as a breeding bird and even present at high altitudes with extremely low temperatures in winter. Amur Falcon Falco amurensis and Red-footed Falcon F. vespertinus: respectively rarely seen and passing during migration. Laggar Falcon Falco jugger: never observed during the early 1990s, observations have increased in recent years with almost annually records nowadays, even in late autumn and in early spring. Saker Falco cherrug: present all-year round, especially in the Chang Tang. Juveniles disperse from the area. Territory defence starts already late January, irrespective of temperature. Breeding starts as early as the beginning of March. Twice a Saker was recorded as being killed by a Eurasian Eagle Owl Bubo bubo hemachalanus; in one such case, the owl simply dropped onto a breeding Saker which was taken by surprise. Gyr Falcon Falco rusticolus: one bird, which had broken its wing against a nomad tent on 27 February 1992 near Dinggo (33°20’N, 84°40’E), three other birds were recorded in the central Chang Tang between 32-34°N and 83-87°E, on 22 February 1995, 26 February 1995 and 1 December 1998 respectively.

AB  - Since 1997, associates of Zoocomplex (Tashkent, Uzbekistan) implemented studies on hatching the Horsfield’s tortoise on farms at commercial levels. The technology of collection and incubation of eggs, and the ranching of young tortoises, was mastered. Several methods were applied to obtain eggs from tortoises constantly kept in captivity, those temporarily kept in the nursery, and incubated eggs collected in the wild (R). According to CITES, R (ranching) is a method based on the collection of eggs, incubation and artificial hatching. Totally, 20,000 eggs were obtained. Some eggs from various ranges were measured and weighed. Differences in sizes and weight of eggs collected from areas with different natural conditions were recorded. Egg length varied from 36.1 to 56.5 mm. The survival rate of eggs constituted 75%. A positive correlation between body sizes of hatched tortoises with egg sizes was recorded. The size of hatched tortoises reached 25.2 to 48.6 mm; the weight was about 20 g. During seven months of rearing, 5% of hatched tortoises died (against 70 – 90% in the wild). Of 15,000 hatched tortoises, recorded were 29 twin pairs, of which 13 pairs were normal and 16 pairs were asymmetrical twins; four terato-twin abnormalities with varying levels of terato-duplication were recorded.

AB  - Abstract The range of Agrionemys horsfieldii in Iran is outlined and known locality records are mapped, including seven new localities from northern and eastern Iran. New data on habitats and population densities in different landscapes are given. Population density varied between 0.7 and 2.15 ind./ha. An historical analysis of the habitat formation and divergence of the Horsfield tortoise on the Iranian Plateau is given. Information on morphology, ecology and parasitology of the populations from the environs of Mazdavand is presented. The morphometric characteristics of two populations were compared and some morphometric indices were found. The possible cooccurrence of Agrionemys horsfieldii and Testudo graeca zarudnyi is discussed. These two species show a preference for different conditions and rarely meet together in the same habitat.

AB  - Based on polymorphism of the 12S rRNA gene and RAPD markers, differentiation of 122 tortoise individuals belonging to the three species of genus Testudo (T. kleinmanni, T. marginata, and T. graeca), six subspecies of T. graeca (T. g. nikolskii, T. g. pallasi, T. g. armeniaca, T. g. zarudnyi, T. g. terrestris, T. g. ibera), and two subspecies of the Central Asian tortoise Agrionenemys horsfieldii (A. h. horsfieldii, A. h. kazakhstanica) was performed. For comparison, 32 known sequences of 12S rRNA gene (392 bp) from tortoises of the two genera inhabiting the territories of Europe, Asia, and Africa were used. In the populations of A. horsfieldii, a total of six haplotypes; including three newly described variants, were identified. In the examined tortoises of the genus Testudo, eleven 12S rRNA haplotypes were identified. One new haplotype was detected in T. kleinmanni. Among the eight subspecies of T. graeca, eight haplotypes were identified, with four newly described ones. The reported RAPD markers generally supported the reconstructions obtained with the use of the mitochondrial marker. Similarly to the 12S rRNA-based reconstructions, two independent clusters included representatives of the two genera, Agrionemys and Testudio. Among the latter, representatives of T. marginata and T. kleinmanni, as well as T. graeca, with high statistical support values, formed two reciprocally monophyletic groups. Compared to the mitochondrial markers, RAPDs more statisticallysignificantly discriminated the sample of T. g. terrestris and the four subspecies, T. g. ibera, T. g. armeniaca, T. g. pallasi, and T. g. nikolskii. In almost all cases except the representatives of T. g. ibera, the representatives of each of four subspecies formed individual subclusters. The geographical haplotype distribution patterns and possible evolutionary scenario of the origin and dispersal of tortoises of the two genera are discussed.

AB  - Indian star tortoise (Geochelone elegans Schoepff, 1795) is a terrestrial herbivorous reptile that is classified under the vulnerable species of IUCN-Red List. The present communication reports the successful management of gastrointestinal parasitism due to co-infection with oxyurids and ascarid nematodes in the captive population of Indian star tortoise maintained at Zoological Garden, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. The diseased tortoise exhibited clinical signs like diarrhea, anorexia, and weight loss. Direct microscopic examination of pooled fecal sample identified the presence of oxyurid and ascarid ova. Therapeutic management involved a two-dose regimen of pyrantel pamoate given in a 2 week interval at a dose rate of 5 mg/kg body weight per orally. Complete parasitological clearance was observed 2 weeks after initiating the therapy without any recurrence. The two-dose pyrantel pamoate protocol was found to be effective in controlling the parasitic burden of captive Indian star tortoise. Chemotherapy can be combined with managemental changes to nullify the possibility of re-infection.

Los metodos de investigacion fueron: 1) campana de informacion y estudio; 2) entrevistas con los habitantes; 3) expediciones de campo, y 4) un estudio de laboratorio sobre la viabilidad de las tortugas encontradas. En el curso de la investigacion fueron registradas por primera vez cinco nuevas especies aloctonas y subespecies de las tortugas; los nuevos datos se obtuvieron en la busqueda de Trachemys scripta elegans en la naturaleza. La mayoria de los animales registrados (80%) fueron retirados de la naturaleza. La educacion de la poblacion se considera de gran importancia ya que las tortugas aloctonas llegan como resultado de la fuga de los amantes de las mascotas y por su introduccion ilegal en la naturaleza. EnglishThe aim of the research was to investigate the presence of allochthonous species of turtles in the nature of Latvia, as well as to withdraw them from the nature according to the "Plan on protection of Emys orbicularis in Latvia", officially approved by the Latvian Ministry of Environment (Pupiņs & Pupiņa 2007a). The methods of the research were: 1) information campaign and survey; 2) interviews with inhabitants; 3) field expeditions; 4) laboratory study of viability of found turtles. In course of research, five new allochthonous species and subspecies of the turtles were recorded for the first time, and new data were obtained about finding Trachemys scripta elegans in the nature of Latvia. Most of the registered animals (80%) were removed from the nature. Since allochthonous turtles get there in the result of escape from pet-lovers and, apparently, illegal introduction into nature by their owners, education of population is of great importance.

        <jats:p>This article provides a classification of morphological features of the Central Asian tortoise species Agrionemys horsfieldii (Gray 1844) distributed in Kashkadarya region. The data presented in the article are based on research materials conducted in Kashkadarya region in 2019-2022. Eleven sites were selected for the study, including biogeocinoses of deserts (260-600m above sea level), foothills(800-1500m above sea level) and mountains(1800-2200m above sea level). The reason, it is expedient to study morphological changes resulting from ecological adaptation in biogeocenoses, because a particular ecological environment leads to the encounter of similar individuals between subspecies. The differences between the morphological characteristics of the samples (n=204) taken over the whole region were then examined by means of mathematical modeling of pholidosis and morphological features. The aim of the study was to study the morphological differences of tortoises found in Kashkadarya region and to distinguish them as different subspecies or one subspecies. During the study, individuals belonging to the genus Agrionemys were returned in 8 of the 11 areas. When we looked at the carpases of A. horsfieldii (Gray 1844) individuals, we found that the distance difference between the 3,6,8 marginales scales was different, and we formed the W6M/W3M, W6M/W8M parameter for biostatistics from them, that this difference could determine the subspecies. And this parameter was analyzed by software XLSTAT done. Geometric morphology was then mathematically modeled using TPS until64 and TPS digetal256 software and analyzed by MorphoJ software.</jats:p>

AB  - Based on intraspecific polymorphism of 12S rRNA gene, genetic variation of isolated populations of the Central Asian tortoise, Agrionemys horsfieldii, was for the first time investigated on a large part of the species distribution range, encompassing Uzbekistan, southern Kazakhstan, and northern and eastern Iran. In 59 tortoises, four haplotypes were discovered, including two (AH1 and AH2), described earlier. Haplotype AH1 was detected in 52 tortoises, inhabiting southern Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Haplotype AH2 was found in four tortoises from the border territory between Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan. Two novel haplotypes, AH3 and AH4, were detected in the three tortoises from Iran. Based on nucleotide substitutions in the 12S rDNA sequence, the possible divergence time between the tortoises from different parts of the range was estimated. Possible pathways of the formation of modern intraspecific groups of A. horsfieldii are discussed.

AB  - The species and subspecies of W Palaearctic tortoises include six, which are widespread in southern Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, and four with restricted ranges in the Mediterranean region. The Central Asian Testudo (Agrionemys) horsfieldii GRAY overlaps with Testudo graeca zarudnyiNIKOLSKY in Iran and Afghanistan. The distributions of the remainder border the Mediterranean Sea. Their survival is threatened directly or indirectly by human activity over many years and include habitat destruction (urbanization, touristic development, road-building, scrubland fires and agriculture), bulk pet and food trade collection for export to NW Europe (Testudo graeca graeca L., Testudo graeca ibera PAL-LAS, Testudo hermanni hermanni GMELIN, T. (A.) horsfieldii and sometimes Testudo marginata SCHOEPFF), isolation of populations with restricted ranges (Testudo hermanni robertmertensiWERMUTH, Testudo (Pseudotestudo) kleinmanni LORTET, T. marginata and Testudo graeca floweri BODENHEIMER), and desertification, especially in the Saharan encroachment zone of northern Africa from wood burning, animal grazing and rainfall decrease (T. g. graeca and T. (P.) kleinmanni). A circum-Mediterranean investigation would establish the population status of all species and their habitats. Countries of the Council of Europe and European Economic Community by ratifying C.I.T.E.S. (Washington Convention 1973) have established the extent of the bulk trade. This should only be allowed in captive-bred animals which, like other domestic pets, could be commercially farmed, probably by necessity in the Mediterranean bioclimatic zone.

AB  - <jats:p>The harvesting of the Central Asian tortoise has been a longstanding practice in Uzbekistan. Throughout the 1930s–1950s, this species was harvested to feed farm livestock and shepherd dogs, and during the World War II, tortoise meat was used to provide additional nutrition to the people. The 1960s marked the start of commercial trade in tortoises. The annual volumes of legal harvesting of wild tortoises started to grow in the late 1990s, and reached 85 thousand specimens per year by 2017. The size of the populations at regular harvesting locations has dropped, and their gender and age composition has changed. The CITES export quota for tortoises bred in captivity was increased in 2018–2019 without valid justification, although small breeding centers have no capacity to breed the manifested quantities of animals. Consequently, Uzbekistan currently exports ranched individuals as well as young wild tortoises, mis-declared as bred in captivity. The export of Central Asian tortoises from Uzbekistan should be suspended temporarily until an expert assessment of the situation is made, and penalties for poaching these animals should be made more severe.</jats:p>

AB  - The development objective of the 1000 Electricity Transmission and Trade Project for Central Asia and South Asia is to create the conditions for sustainable electricity trade between the Central Asia countries of Tajikistan and Kyrgyz Republic and the South Asian countries of Afghanistan and Pakistan, in order to alleviate power supply shortages in the South Asian countries and enhance sector and budget revenues in the Central Asian countries. Some of the negative impacts include: (i) audible noise will be generated by most of converter and electrode equipment during operation; (ii) exposure to electro Magnetic Fields (EMF) and radio interferences from the converter and electrode station equipment; (iii) improper design of these facilities pose risk to workers’ health and safety; (iv) oil spills and leaks from the transformers, reactors and capacitors; (iv) risk of soil and water pollution from construction activities; (v) dust and noise from construction activities; (vi) waste generation and disposal; (vii) impacts on biodiversity, including red book species as steppe tortoise; and (viii) impact on soil and groundwater quality. Some of the mitigation measures include: (i) to design equipment that generate low sound levels; (ii) adequate spacing between the equipment and fencing/boundary wall or right of way. International standards on radio interferences will also be complied with; (iii) water supply facilities including facilities for firefighting and cooling; (iii) to design oil containment and recuperation systems around all transformers, reactors and capacitors; (iv) implementation of soil and pollution control measures; (v) maintenance of construction equipment and vehicles; (vi) proper collection and disposal of waste in the local municipal waste disposal facilities; (vii) to follow the special biodiversity management plan for Central Asian tortoise; and (viii) regular maintenance of oil containment facilities and monitoring.

AB  - Herpesviruses are found in free-living and captive chelonian populations, often in association with morbidity and mortality. To date, all known chelonian herpesviruses fall within the subfamily <i>Alphaherpesvirinae</i>. We detected a novel herpesvirus in 3 species of chelonians: a captive leopard tortoise (<i>Stigmochelys pardalis</i>) in western TX, USA; a steppe tortoise (<i>Testudo</i> [<i>Agrionemys</i>] <i>horsfieldii</i>) found near Fort Irwin, CA, USA; and 2 free-living, three-toed box turtles (<i>Terrapene mexicana triunguis</i>) found in Forest Park, St. Louis, MO. The leopard tortoise was coinfected with the tortoise intranuclear coccidian and had clinical signs of upper respiratory tract disease. The steppe tortoise had mucopurulent nasal discharge and lethargy. One of the three-toed box turtles had no clinical signs; the other was found dead with signs of trauma after being observed with blepharedema, tympanic membrane swelling, cervical edema, and other clinical signs several weeks prior to death. Generally, the branching order of the turtle herpesviruses mirrors the divergence patterns of their hosts, consistent with codivergence. Based on phylogenetic analysis, this novel herpesvirus clusters with a clade of viruses that infect emydid hosts and is likely of box turtle origin. Therefore, we suggest the name terrapene alphaherpesvirus 3 (TerAHV3) for the novel virus. This virus also has the ability to host-jump to tortoises, and previously documented herpesviral morbidity tends to be more common in aberrant hosts. The relationship between clinical signs and infection with TerAHV3 in these animals is unclear, and further investigation is merited.
