AB  - An adult female Aldabra giant tortoise (Geochelone gigantea) was Found dead with a 2 month-history of decreased appetite. At necropsy, multiple ulcers were seen in the mucosa of stomach and colon. Histopathologically, the ulcers were characterized by extensive necrosis, hemorrhage, and marked edema, along with numerous chlamidospores and aseptate fungal hyphae. Fungal structures infiltrated into the lamina propria, submucosa and muscle layer; their invasion into blood vessels formed thrombosis. Immunohistochemical, the fungal structures were strongly positive with an antibody against Candida spp. This case is the first report on gastrointestinal candidiasis in an Aldabra giant tortoise.

AB  - The complete mitochondrial genome of the Aldabra giant tortoise [Aldabrachelys gigantea (Schweigger, 1812): Reptilia, Testudines, Testudinidae] was sequenced using a shotgun approach on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). This genome was 16 467 bp long and presents the typical organization found in vertebrates. The mean coverage of sequencing was 116x. A phylogenetic analysis of the Testudinidae confirms the placement of Aldabrachelys in an Indian Ocean group (including Madagascar). This mitogenome constitutes a reference for ancient DNA analyses of the extinct Madagascan lineages of Aldabrachelys.

Analysis revealed liver disease and collected biopsy diagnosed Candida krusei infection. Despite Itraconazole treatment, the tortoise got worse and died. Full necropsy was performed; microbiology showed Candida krusei presence in liver, but histopathology didn't confirm fungal presence with special stains, so scanning electron microscopy was essential to prove a detailed diagnosis of extensive mycosis.

AB  - Aim Heterophylly is present in many plant species on oceanic islands. Almost all of these plants are island endemics, and heterophylly may have evolved as a response to feeding from large insular browsers such as giant tortoises and flightless birds. We tested this anti-browser hypothesis by feeding Aldabra giant tortoises (Geochelone gigantea) with leaves of native Mauritian plants to see if they distinguished between juvenile and adult leaves and between heteophyllous and homophyllous species.
   Location Mauritius.
   Methods In a choice experiment we recorded feeding response of four captive Aldabra giant tortoises to 10 species of Mauritian plants, of which seven were heterophyllous and three homophyllous.
   Results In general, juvenile leaves of heterophyllous species showed convergence in shape and midrib coloration. Homophyllous foliage was preferred to heterophyllous, and among heterophyllous species adult foliage was preferred to juvenile.
   Main conclusions Several Mascarene heterophyllous plants show convergence in morphology of juvenile leaves and these are avoided by giant tortoises. This indicates a strong selection history from large browsers such as the giant tortoises. The Mascarene example is in accordance with several other comparable cases of plant-large browser interactions from other archipelagos.

AB  - Replacing recently extinct endemic giant tortoises with extant, functional analogues provide the perhaps best examples of island rewilding to date. Yet, an efficient future application of this conservation action is challenging in an era of climate change. We here present and discuss a conceptual framework that can serve as a roadmap for the study and application of tortoise rewilding in an uncertain future. We focus on three main ecological functions mediated by giant tortoises, namely herbivory, seed dispersal and nutrient cycling, and discuss how climate change is likely to impact these. We then propose and discuss mitigation strategies such as artificial constructed shade sites and water holes that can help drive and maintain the ecosystem functions provided by the tortoises on a landscape scale. The application of the framework and the mitigation strategies are illustrated with examples from both wild and rewilded populations of the Aldabra giant tortoise, Aldabrachelys gigantea, in the Western Indian Ocean.

AB  - The evaluation of offspring sex ratios is important in any large-scale threatened species breeding programs if temperature-dependent sex determination is a possibility. We assessed the sex ratio in captive-bred juvenile Aldabra tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea or Dipsochelys dussumieri) at the La Vanille Crocodile and Tortoise Park in Mauritius. The gonads of small juvenile Aldabra tortoises are thin and elongate and fixed to the dorsal part of the body cavity, with ovaries appearing as transparent sheaths with some visible oocytes and testes appearing as small, transparent, thin, sausage-like structures with a net of fine blood vessels on the surface. With growth, ovaries expand and masses of previtellogenic follicles appear on the surface; testes first turn pinkish-white and then yellowish, with tubular structures visible through a thin, transparent theca containing a network of fine blood vessels but no melanocytes. Three tortoises had both testes and ovaries and were classified as intersexes. Aldabra tortoises bred in La Vanille in the late 1990s and 2000s show a male:female ratio of 1:4 (n = 106), suggesting that Aldabra tortoises have temperature-dependent sex determination. However, the incubation conditions were not monitored rigorously enough to allow the determination of pivotal temperatures or the transitional range of male- and female-producing temperatures. Because a female-biased sex ratio seems to be preferable to a male-biased or even to a balanced sex ratio in recovery programs of threatened species, there does not seem to be an immediate need to change egg incubation methods to adjust sex ratios.

AB  - The complete primary structures of alpha(D)-2- and beta-globin of hemoglobin D (Hb D) from the Aldabra giant tortoise, Geochelone gigantea, have been constructed by amino acid sequencing analysis in assistance with nucleotide sequencing analysis of PCR fragments amplified using degenerate oligonucleotide primers. Using computer-assisted sequence comparisons, the alpha(D)-2-globin shared a 92.0% sequence identity versus alpha(D)-globin of Geochelone carbonaria, a 75.2% versus alpha(D)-globin of Aves (Rhea americana) and a 62.4% versus alpha(A)-globin of Hb A expressed in adult red blood cells of Geochelone gigantea. Additionally, judging from their primary structures, an identical beta-globin was common to the two hemoglobin components, Hb A and Hb D. The alpha(D)-2- and beta-globin genes contained the three-exon and two-intron configurations and showed the characteristic of all functional vertebrate hemoglobin genes except an abnormal GC dinucleotide instead of the invariant GT at the 5' end of the second intron sequence. The introns of alpha(D)-2-globin gene were both small (224-bp/first intron, 227-bp/second intron) such that they were quite similar to those of adult alpha-type globins; the beta-globin gene has one small intron (approximately 130-bp) and one large intron (approximately 1590-bp).
   A phylogenetic tree constructed on primary structures of 7 alpha(D)-globins from Reptilia (4 species of turtles, 2 species of squamates, and 1 species of sphenodontids) and two embryonic a-like globins from Aves (Gullus gullus) and Mammals (Homo sapiens) showed the following results: (1) alpha(D)-globins except those of squamates were clustered, in which Sphenodon punctatus was a closer species to birds than turtles; (2) separation of the alpha(A)- and alpha(D)-globin genes occurred approximately 250 million years ago after the embryonic alpha-type globin-genes (pi' and zeta) first split off from the ancestor of alpha-type globin gene family.

AB  - Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) are currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. However, negative impacts of sea-level rise are predicted to result in an overall population decline of 40-65 % over the next 100 years, rendering the species Endangered. Captive propagation is an important tool for in- and ex-situ species conservation, but breeding success outside the tortoises' native island habitats has been very limited. Until now, the reproductive cycle of Aldabra tortoises has only been described in anatomic and behavioural studies. During a one-year period, plasma of four female and four male wild tortoises on Aldabra Atoll were examined monthly for levels of gonadal steroid hormones (oestradiol, testosterone, progesterone). Plasma oestradiol and testosterone values as well as meteorological data of the sampling period corresponded to previously published reports on seasonal changes in anatomy, behaviour and climate on the Aldabra Atoll. Seasonal changes in plasma testosterone were evident in males, with high values from January through April, reflecting previously described testicular growth and breeding season, followed by a nadir in August and September. In females, plasma oestradiol levels displayed seasonal changes, coinciding with reported ovarian growth from January to May. The obtained data provide prerequisite knowledge for endocrinological monitoring of reproductive processes and management of breeding programs, both ex-situ as in-situ, to establish reserve- and rewilded populations.

KW  - ULTRASONOGRAPHY
KW  - ANATOMY
AB  - Objectives In recent years echocardiography has become a good diagnostic tool in Zoo Medicine but in some cases, it is still a challenge. In Aldabra giant tortoise (Aldabrachelys gigantea) the big size of animals and the few individuals hosted in Zoo are critical points for the application of this diagnostic technique. The purposes of this research were: to evaluate the feasibility of the diagnostic imaging technique on big-sized turtles; to define the echographic parameters for this species; and to describe the morphofunctional and physiological echographic characteristics of their cardiovascular system.
   Design Repeated measures in vivo.
   Setting Ultrasonography systematic description and Doppler analysis of the cardiovascular system of Aldabra giant tortoise were carried out; B-mode examination allowed the evaluation of the kinetics of the ventricle, the atria and the atrioventricular valves.
   Participants 4 Aldabra giant tortoises (two adult males and two young females) hosted in two zoological gardens.
   Interventions Echocardiography was performed placing the animals in ventral on a restraining platform raised from the floor, to provide adequate accessibility to the thoracic windows where the probe was placed. No chemical restraint was used.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures Heart rate, systolic and diastolic areas and volumes, vessel diameters and blood flow velocity were measured.
   Results Heart rate was 21 +/- 4 bpm (range 14-25 bpm). The averages of the diastolic and systolic area indexes linked to the subject weight were: 21 +/- 3 cm(2) and 9 +/- 1 cm(2). The aortic annulus diameter in female specimens measured 11.2 +/- 0.8 mm, while it measured 21.5 +/- 0.3 mm in male species.
   Conclusion Results confirm the effectiveness of echocardiography as a means to study and evaluate the cardiovascular system of this species even if more studies on a bigger number of patients would be necessary to develop the echocardiography technique.

AB  - Giant tortoises are among the longest-lived vertebrate animals and, as such, provide an excellent model to study traits like longevity and age-related diseases. However, genomic and molecular evolutionary information on giant tortoises is scarce. Here, we describe a global analysis of the genomes of Lonesome George-the iconic last member of Chelonoidis abingdonii-and the Aldabra giant tortoise (Aldabrachelys gigantea). Comparison of these genomes with those of related species, using both unsupervised and supervised analyses, led us to detect lineage-specific variants affecting DNA repair genes, inflammatory mediators and genes related to cancer development. Our study also hints at specific evolutionary strategies linked to increased lifespan, and expands our understanding of the genomic determinants of ageing. These new genome sequences also provide important resources to help the efforts for restoration of giant tortoise populations.

AB  - Although it was forgotten for over a century, the binomen Testudo dussumieri Gray, 1831, is an available name, and the specimen RMNH 3231 deposited in the natural history museum of Leiden - evidently one of the two original syntypes of T. dussumieri - has been designated as the lectotype of this taxon. Recently several authors have actively promoted this as the name-bearing type for the Aldabra tortoise, escalating debates in which this chelonian has been immersed for nearly two decades. This lectotype designation is highly significant to nomenclatural and taxonomic disputes regarding tortoises (Testudinidae), living and extinct, from the western Indian Ocean; and an attempt has been made in this paper to compile all information relevant to the lectotype as well as to better understand the history of the binomen applied to it. Several critical aspects of the history are uncertain and open to speculation. The provenance of RMNH 3231 is unknown and unlikely to be Aldabra Atoll; the specimen was most likely collected in the granitic Seychelles, between 1823 and 1829. The combination of estimated date and locality of collection raises the possibility that the lectotype is not an Aldabra tortoise, but rather an extinct taxon from the granitic Seychelles. It is concluded that RMNH 3231 is not a suitable name-bearing type for the Aldabra tortoise, and the continued use of the name T. dussumieri will cause persistent nomenclatural and taxonomic confusion and unending debate.

AB  - Background: The Aldabra giant tortoise (Aldabrachelys gigantea) is one of only two giant tortoise species left in the world. The species is endemic to Aldabra Atoll in Seychelles and is listed as Vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List (v2.3) due to its limited distribution and threats posed by climate change. Genomic resources for A. gigantea are lacking, hampering conservation efforts for both wild and ex situ populations. A high-quality genome would also open avenues to investigate the genetic basis of the species' exceptionally long life span.
   Findings: We produced the first chromosome-level de novo genome assembly of A. gigantea using PacBio High-Fidelity sequencing and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture. We produced a 2.37-Gbp assembly with a scaffold N50 of 148.6 Mbp and a resolution into 26 chromosomes. RNA sequencing-assisted gene model prediction identified 23,953 protein-coding genes and 1.1 Gbp of repetitive sequences. Synteny analyses among turtle genomes revealed high levels of chromosomal collinearity even among distantly related taxa. To assess the utility of the high-quality assembly for species conservation, we performed a low-coverage resequencing of 30 individuals from wild populations and two zoo individuals. Our genome-wide population structure analyses detected genetic population structure in the wild and identified the most likely origin of the zoo-housed individuals. We further identified putatively deleterious mutations to be monitored.
   Conclusions: We establish a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome for A. gigantea and one of the most complete turtle genomes available. We show that low-coverage whole-genome resequencing, for which alignment to the reference genome is a necessity, is a powerful tool to assess the population structure of the wild population and reveal the geographic origins of ex situ individuals relevant for genetic diversity management and rewilding efforts.

AB  - Aldabrachelys gigantea (Aldabra giant tortoise) is one of only two giant tortoise species left in the world and survives as a single wild population of over 100,000 individuals on Aldabra Atoll, Seychelles. Despite this large current population size, the species faces an uncertain future because of its extremely restricted distribution range and high vulnerability to the projected consequences of climate change. Captive-bred A. gigantea are increasingly used in rewilding programs across the region, where they are introduced to replace extinct giant tortoises in an attempt to functionally resurrect degraded island ecosystems. However, there has been little consideration of the current levels of genetic variation and differentiation within and among the islands on Aldabra. As previous microsatellite studies were inconclusive, we combined low-coverage and double-digest restriction-associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing to analyze samples from 33 tortoises (11 from each main island). Using 5426 variant sites within the tortoise genome, we detected patterns of within-island population structure, but no differentiation between the islands. These unexpected results highlight the importance of using genome-wide genetic markers to capture higher-resolution genetic structure to inform future management plans, even in a seemingly panmictic population. We show that low-coverage ddRAD sequencing provides an affordable alternative approach to conservation genomic projects of non-model species with large genomes.

AB  - The Aldabra giant tortoise (Aldabrachelys gigantea) is one of only two remaining giant tortoise species worldwide. Captive-bred A. gigantea are being used in rewilding projects in the Western Indian Ocean to functionally replace the extinct endemic giant tortoise species and restore degraded island ecosystems. Furthermore, large-scale translocations may become necessary as rising sea levels threaten the only wild population on the low-lying Aldabra Atoll. Critical management decisions would be greatly facilitated by insights on the genetic structure of breeding populations. We used a double-digest restriction-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq) approach to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) among the wild population and two additional captive populations of A. gigantea. A total of 1674 unlinked, putatively neutral genome-wide SNPs were identified. The values of expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.33 to 0.5, whereas the minor allele frequency ranged from 0.20 to 0.5. These novel SNP markers will serve as useful tools for informing the conservation of A. gigantea.

AB  - With habitat loss and fragmentation among the greatest threats to biodiversity, a better understanding of the habitat use of keystone species is critical in any conservation management strategy. Aldabra Atoll, in the Seychelles archipelago, has the largest population worldwide of giant tortoises. This endemic species (Aldabrachelys gigantea) could be vulnerable to habitat fragmentation and loss induced by climate change related reduction in rainfall. Here, we assess habitat use and selection by A. gigantea in its natural environment on Aldabra. We quantified the habitat areas of A. gigantea based on the first high-resolution terrestrial habitat map of Aldabra, produced for this purpose using satellite imagery. The resulting map was combined with 4 years of movement data to assess A. gigantea habitat use and selection at landscape and home range scales. Grassland or 'tortoise turf' habitat was most preferred by A. gigantea on Aldabra, at the landscape scale across seasons, followed by open mixed scrub. These two habitats cover only 30 km(2) (19.2%) of the surface of the atoll (total area: 155.5 km(2)). At the home range scale, there was no significant preference shown and habitat was used randomly. Our results suggest that Aldabra's grassland habitat, despite its small area, is of great importance to A. gigantea. Conservation management actions for A. gigantea on Aldabra and elsewhere should therefore focus on the protection and maintenance of this habitat.

AB  - Erythrocytes of the adult axolotl, Ambystoma mexicanum, have multiple hemoglobins. We separated and purified two kinds of hemoglobin, termed major hemoglobin (Hb M) and minor hemoglobin (Hb in), from a five-year-old male by hydrophobic interaction column chromatography on Alkyl Superose. The hemoglobins have two distinct a type globin polypeptides (alpha(M) and alpha(m)) and a common beta globin polypeptide, all of which were purified in FPLC on a reversed-phase column after S-pyridylethylation. The complete amino acid sequences of the three globin chains were determined separately using nucleotide sequencing with the assistance of protein sequencing. The mature globin molecules were composed of 141 amino acid residues for alpha(M) globin, 143 for alpha(m) globin and 146 for beta globin. Comparing primary structures of the five kinds of axolotl globins, including two previously established alpha type globins from the same species, with other known globins of amphibians and representatives of other vertebrates, we constructed phylogenetic trees for amphibian hemoglobins and tetrapod hemoglobins. The molecular trees indicated that alpha(M), alpha(m), beta and the previously known a major globin were adult types of globins and the other known a globin was a larval type. The existence of two to four more globins in the axolotl erythrocyte is predicted. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The work Prodromus Monographiae Cheloniorum, published by Schweigger in 1812, has recently been the subject of several studies. One result of these studies-the rediscovery of the Testudo gigantea Schweigger, 1812 holotype-triggered an intense debate in The Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature, where, among other issues in dispute, the identity and nature of the specimen indicated as the holotype for the species is put in question. Using historical sources, mostly unpublished, and analysis and comparison of taxidermic characteristics of the specimen with other specimens of the same nature, we can clearly trace its origin to the extinct Royal Cabinet of Natural History of Ajuda in Lisbon, from the "philosophical journey" of Alexandre Rodrigues Ferreira to the specimens transported to Paris by Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1808, thus helping dispel any doubts regarding the identity and nature of what is being identified as the Testudo gigantea holotype, along with other chelonian specimens. This information is of great importance in the current taxonomic debate as well as in recognizing the historic importance of the Royal Cabinet of Natural History of Ajuda and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire's 1808 mission to Lisbon.

AB  - An adult male Aldabra tortoise (Geochelone gigantea) presented with a deep flaking area of the carapace, and histologic examination of biopsies from this area revealed phaeohyphomycosis of the superficial keratinized layers. The disease progressed rapidly and spread to numerous sites on the carapace. After several weeks of regular debridement, deep bone involvement was evident and was confirmed through histologic examination. Fungal culture was attempted but was unsuccessful at isolating the infectious agent. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of extracted DNA from the fixed tissue block identified the fungus as Exophiala oligosperma. Initial treatment included weekly debridement and oral and topical antifungal agents. A nuclear scintigraphy bone scan was performed to determine the extent and status of the infection. Multiple foci of uptake of the radiopharmaceutical marker were present within the carapace, indicating active lesions. The tortoise was maintained on oral antifungal treatment, and lesions resolved over several months. A repeat bone scan performed 1 yr after initial presentation showed reduction in marker uptake, indicating a response to treatment in the deeper lesions. Phaeohyphomycosis should lie considered as a differential diagnosis for cases of shell lesions in chelonians.

AB  - This study evaluates the potential impacts of the release of the giant tortoise, Dipsochelys arnoldi, to vacant habitat within the species' presumed historic range. Five individuals (3 males and 2 females) were released in December 2006 in the isolated Grande Barbe area of Silhouette Island, Seychelles. A comprehensive vegetation survey of all plant species within feeding height of the tortoises in Grande Barbe was conducted. These data, combined with daily feeding observations, were used to calculate feeding rates and diet preferences. Tortoises were observed to have a mean diurnal active time of 257 minutes per day exhibiting a mean feeding rate of 3.86 g of plant material consumed per minute of active time. Individuals were recorded feeding on 18 of 26 recorded plant species, 9 of which were selectively foraged. Species composition of plant species ingested differed between sexes. Males selectively foraged on 6 plant species and females selectively foraged on 7 species. Only 2 plant species were selectively foraged by both sexes.

AB  - An experimental translocation of Aldabran giant tortoises Geochelone gigantea to Curieuse in the granitic Seychelles is evaluated. Between 1978 and 1982, 250 animals were released; 117 remained by 1990. Poaching occurs, and recruitment to five years is very low, probably due to feral predators. Some adults are diseased, and low growth and reproductive rates suggest saturation of resources even at low density. Endemic vegetation has not suffered, but tortoises spread exotics. The 'Curieuse Experiment' has furthered tortoise ecology, but failed to establish a wild colony partly because the reasons for the original absence of tortoises were unclear. Reintroduction to the granitic Fregate Island has been comparatively successfuL

AB  - 1. Net displacement is an integral component of numerous ecological processes and is critically dependent on the tortuosity of a movement trajectory and hence on the temporal scale of observation. Numerous attempts have been made to quantitatively describe net displacement while accommodating tortuosity, typically evoking a power law, but scale-dependency in tortuosity limits the utility of approaches based on power law relationships that must assume scale-invariant tortuosity.
   2. We describe a phenomenological model of net displacement that permits both scale-variant and scale-invariant movement. Movement trajectories are divided into pairs of relocations specifying start- and end-points, and net displacements between points are calculated across a vector of time intervals. A bootstrap is implemented to create new datasets that are independent both across and within time intervals, and the model is fitted to the bootstrapped dataset using log-log regression. We apply this model to simulated trajectories and both fine-grain and coarse-grain trajectories obtained from an Aldabra giant tortoise Aldabrachelys gigantea, African elephants Loxodonta africana, black-backed jackals Canis mesomelas and Northern elephant seals Mirounga angustirostris.
   3. The model was able to quantify the characteristics of net displacement from simulated movement trajectories corresponding to both scale-variant (e.g. correlated random walks) and scale-invariant (e.g. random walk) movement models. Furthermore, the model produced identical outputs across time vectors corresponding to different intervals and absolute ranges of time for scale-invariant models. The model characterized the tortoise as generally exhibiting long scale-invariant steps, which was corroborated by visual comparison of model outputs to observed trajectories. Elephants, jackals and seals exhibited movement parameters consistent with their known movement behaviours (nomadism, territoriality and widely ranging searching).
   4. We describe how the model may be used to compare movements within and between species, for example by partitioning movement into scale-variant and scale-invariant components, and by calculating a unitless net displacement scaled to the basal movement capacities of an animal. We also identify several useful derived quantities and realistic parameter ranges and discuss how the model may be implemented in a variety of ecological studies.

AB  - Geochelone pardalis (Bell 1828) shows wide variation of body size in Africa, with tortoises in the north (Republic of Somaliland) being of comparable size to insular giant tortoises. Growth data on G. pardalis, the continental giant species G. sulcata (Miller 1779) and the Aldabran giant tortoise G. gigantea (Schweigger 1812) were re-analysed using Ford-Walford plots, and their growth patterns compared. All species and populations fitted a two-phase growth curve, with initial asymptotic growth followed by slow indeterminate linear growth. Asymptotic growth was non-Bertalanffy in all groups, with most individuals fitting Gompertz or logistic-by-mass models best. Juvenile growth (for ages 3-8) was also approximately linear in all groups. Variation between populations and species was in the rate of juvenile growth, asymptotic size reached, rate of subsequent linear growth, and survival rate of older individuals. Geochelone pardalis from Somaliland had similar juvenile growth rates and asymptotic sizes to other populations, and their large mean size was due to high survival and continued linear growth after the asymptote. Geochelone sulcata had similar juvenile growth rates to G. pardalis, but reached larger asymptotic sizes; indeterminate linear growth was similar to that of G. pardalis. Geochelone gigantea had much higher juvenile growth rates than the continental species, reflecting a longer activity season. Asymptotic size and the rate of indeterminate linear growth were lower in a high-density (Grande Terre) than low-density (Ile Malabar) population of G. gigantea. The growth rate of juveniles was not affected by population density, so that the Grande Terre population had higher growth rates of juveniles relative to larger tortoises and was the only group to approach Bertalanffy-type growth, as predicted.

AB  - The first objective of this study was to establish clinically relevant techniques for cardiac echocardiography in nonanesthetized Galapagos (Chelonoidis nigra complex) and Aldabra (Aldabrachelys gigantea) tortoises. A second objective was to establish guidelines for determining normal echocardiographic anatomy and function in both species. Select echocardiographic reference values were defined for 17 healthy Galapagos tortoises and 27 healthy Aldabra tortoises. Tortoises were either placed in ventral recumbency on an elevated surface or allowed to stand in a natural position by using food distraction. An ultrasound probe was applied in the left or right cervicobrachial window and was positioned in two long axis views to evaluate the three chambers of the heart and the associated great vessels, the presence of pericardial effusion, the atrioventricular inflow velocities, and pulmonic and aortic outflow velocities. The heart rate was 28 +/- 12 (median +/- SD) bpm, and the ejection fraction was 60.5 +/- 10%. Thirty-four of 44 tortoises had identifiable physiologic pericardial effusion. All tortoises were successfully imaged using the techniques described, with consistent identification of cardiac structure and assessment of function. This study provides echocardiographic reference intervals for the clinical evaluation of suspected cardiac disease in captive-managed Galapagos and Aldabra tortoises.

AB  - A microbiome is defined as a complex collection of microorganisms and their genetic material. Studies regarding gut microbiomes of different animals have provided ecological and evolutionary information showing a strong link between health and disease. Very few studies have compared the gut microbiota of animals housed under controlled conditions and those in wild habitats. Little research has been performed on the reptile gut microbiota, and what studies do exist are mainly focused on carnivorous reptiles. The aim of this study was first to describe the overall microbiota structure of Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) and, second, to compare the microbiota of tortoises living under natural conditions and tortoises living in controlled environments, such as zoological and botanical parks, in Italy and in the Seychelles. Seventeen fecal samples were collected from giant tortoises located on Curieuse Island (CI, n = 8), at the Botanical Garden (BG, n = 3) in Mahe (Seychelles Islands) and at Parco Natura Viva-Garda Zoological Park (PNV, n = 6) in Verona (Italy). The V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified in order to characterize the gut microbiota profile. Overall, the major phyla identified were Bacteroidetes 42%, Firmicutes 32%, and Spirochaetes 9%. A higher microbial diversity (alpha indices) was observed for the BG samples as compared to the PNV samples (Shannon: 5.39 vs. 4.43; InvSimpson: 80.7 vs. 25; Chao1: 584 vs. 377 p < 0.05). The results in the present study showed a significant difference in beta diversity between the samples from CI, BG, and PNV (p = 0.001), suggesting a different bacterial fecal profile of giant tortoises at the different habitats. This study provided novel insights into the effects of different environmental conditions on the gut microbial communities of giant tortoises. In particular, differences were reported regarding the bacterial gut community structure between tortoises in natural and in controlled environments. These results could help to improve the management of giant tortoises under human care, thus enhancing ex-situ conservation efforts far from the species geographic range.

AB  - Understanding the extent of morphological variation in the wild population of Aldabra giant tortoises is important for conservation, as morphological variation in captive populations has been interpreted as evidence for lingering genes from extinct tortoise lineages. If true, this could impact reintroduction programmes in the region. The population of giant tortoises on Aldabra Atoll is subdivided and distributed around several islands. Although pronounced morphological variation was recorded in the late 1960s, it was thought to be a temporary phenomenon. Early researchers also raised concerns over the future of the population, which was perceived to have exceeded its carrying capacity. We analyzed monthly monitoring data from 12 transects spanning a recent 15-year period (1998-2012) during which animals from four subpopulations were counted, measured, and sexed. In addition, we analyzed survival data from individuals first tagged during the early 1970s. The population is stable with no sign of significant decline. Subpopulations differ in density, but these differences are mostly due to differences in the prevailing vegetation type. However, subpopulations differ greatly in both the size of animals and the degree of sexual dimorphism. Comparisons with historical data reveal that phenotypic differences among the subpopulations of tortoises on Aldabra have been apparent for the last 50years with no sign of diminishing. We conclude that the giant tortoise population on Aldabra is subject to varying ecological selection pressures, giving rise to stable morphotypes in discrete subpopulations. We suggest therefore that (1) the presence of morphological differences among captive Aldabra tortoises does not alone provide convincing evidence of genes from other extinct species; and (2) Aldabra serves as an important example of how conservation and management insitu can add to the scientific value of populations and perhaps enable them to better adapt to future ecological pressures.

AB  - Background: Hematologic and plasma biochemical evaluations are routinely used in evaluating the chelonian patient, but appropriate processing techniques have been minimally defined. Objectives: This study was designed to compare the effects of temperature, time, anticoagulant, and species on sodium and potassium values in the Aldabra tortoise (Geochelone gigantea) and the Burmese mountain tortoise (Manouria emys). Methods: Blood samples from 7 Aldabra tortoises and 8 Burmese mountain tortoises were collected into tubes without anticoagulant and tubes containing lithium heparin. Sodium and potassium concentrations were measured by flame photometry in serum and plasma harvested immediately after collection and from aliquots of whole blood stored at 4degreesC and 25degreesC for 5 to 120 minutes. Results: In Aldabra tortoises, storage time and temperature had no significant effect on potassium concentrations in heparinized blood and in blood without anticoagulant. However, sodium concentrations in serum and plasma decreased significantly in samples without anticoagulant stored at 4degrees C and 25degreesC and in heparinized samples stored at 4degreesC. In Burmese mountain tortoises, potassium concentrations in serum and plasma increased significantly with time in samples without anticoagulant and in heparinized samples stored at 4degreesC and 25degreesC, but the increases were less at 4degreesC. Sodium concentrations in serum and plasma decreased significantly in blood without anticoagulant and heparinized blood stored at 4degreesC and 25degreesC. Conclusions: Storage of blood samples with and without anticoagulant at 4degreesC significantly improved the stability of potassium and sodium concentrations in both species of tortoises. Early separation of red cells from serum or plasma after blood collection is especially important to ensure the reliability of potassium measurements.

AB  - Anesthesia is often required for the medical management of large tortoise species, but little has been published regarding effective anesthetic regimens for these species. The purpose of this study was to review anesthetic regimens that have been used safely and effectively in Galapagos (Chelonoidis nigra), Aldabra (Aldabrachelys gigantea), and African spurred (Centrochelys sulcata) tortoises, with the aim of improving medical management.
   Tortoises belong to the taxonomic family Testudinidae, which is considered one of the most imperiled families of the order Testudines. Anesthesia is often required for the medical and surgical management of large tortoises. The objectives of this retrospective study were to review drug regimens used to successfully anesthetize Galapagos (Chelonoidis nigra), Aldabra (Aldabrachelys gigantea) and African spurred (Centrochelys sulcata) tortoises, and to compare the times to effect and to extubation in tortoises administered different premedication protocols. Anesthetic records of giant tortoises admitted to the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine between January 2009 and December 2019 were reviewed. A total of 34 tortoises (six Aldabra, 23 Galapagos, and five African spurred) were included, resulting in 64 anesthetic events. Frequently used premedication protocols included an a(2)-adrenergic agonist and ketamine combined with either midazolam (group a(2)-adrenergic agonist, midazolam, ketamine, AMK; n = 34), a mu-opioid receptor agonist (group a(2)-adrenergic agonist, mu-opioid receptor agonist, ketamine, AOK; n = 13), or a mu-opioid receptor agonist and midazolam (group a(2)-adrenergic agonist, midazolam, mu-opioid receptor agonist, ketamine, AMOK; n = 10). Inhalant anesthetics (isoflurane, n = 21; sevoflurane, n = 23) were frequently used for maintenance of anesthesia following premedication. Out of the 34 total tortoises, 22 had only one anesthetic event, five had two anesthetic events, three had three anesthetic events, and four had four or more anesthetic events. Few adverse effects were observed and there was no mortality reported during the peri-anesthetic period. Sedation and general anesthesia of giant tortoises can be successfully performed with a combination of an a(2)-adrenergic agonist and ketamine in combination with midazolam and/or a mu-opioid receptor agonist.

AB  - Seed dispersal through endozoochory is a critical ecosystem function worldwide. Seed gut retention time (GRT; the duration that seeds are retained in the digestive tract) is an important part of the qualitative component of the seed dispersal effectiveness framework. GRT is a major determinant of when and how far away seeds are dispersed, aiding seeds in escaping predation in space as well as in time. In this study, we examined whether the size of the disperser and/or the size of the ingested seeds affect the GRT in Aldabra Giant Tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) on Aldabra Atoll, Seychelles. We selected tortoises of varying body mass (mean +/- 1 SD = 48.6 +/- 27.2 kg, range = 0.6-104.0 kg) and fed them different-sized artificial seeds (plastic beads; 2, 4.5, and 10 mm diameter). Tortoises defecated the first beads a mean of 12.0 +/- 2.7 d after ingestion, and the last beads 20.4 +/- 6.0 d after ingestion. Mean GRT was 14.6 +/- 3.7 d. We show that neither tortoise body size nor bead size had an effect on the patterns and time of defecation. We discuss the relevance of our result for seed dispersal and for rewilding projects that use Aldabra Giant Tortoises as substitute species for extinct giant tortoises on other oceanic islands.

AB  - Tortoises perceive different colours and rely on the visual system to find food. However, few studies have considered colour preference in tortoises, especially in land species. The aim of this study is to investigate whether Aldabra giant tortoises (Geochelone gigantea) housed in Parco Natura Viva (VR), an Italian zoological garden, show a specific colour preference in their social context. The study was divided into two different periods in which red and yellow balls of the same size were scattered around in the outdoor enclosure. In the first period, pieces of carrots were placed behind each ball whereas in the second period, carrots were replaced with apples. Data on the frequencies of interaction with red and yellow balls were collected. First, tortoises interacted more with the balls when pieces of apples rather than carrots were hidden behind them. No significant group level colour preference was found; however, individual-level variation in colour preference was reported. In addition, tortoises interacted significantly more with the yellow balls in the second than in the first period. Food typology seems therefore to play an important role in determining colour preference in chelonians. Research aimed at identifying individual differences in animal preferences might be valuable to improve captive animal husbandry (e.g.: development of enrichment programmes, diets and rewards).

AB  - We recorded the thermoregulatory patterns of five Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) (25-193 kg) during spring (ZRH spring trial), after the installation of a heating area (concrete heat pad and basking lamp) at Zurich Zoo, Switzerland. The measurements were compared to published results on the same tortoises observed prior to the installation of the heater (ZRH summer and winter trials), and on wild tortoises on Aldabra Atoll. The mean environmental temperature outside the heating area was 23.3 degrees C, significantly lower compared to Aldabra Atoll (30.3 degrees C; range: 23.8-43.8 degrees C), and to the environmental temperature range at which tortoises maximize their activity in the wild (Ta-opt; 25.8-31.7 degrees C). The heating area exhibited a mean temperature of 36.3 degrees C, and tortoises that made use of the heating area were able to maintain a mean core body temperature (T-bc) of 30.0 degrees C, which was comparable to the T-bc of tortoises during ZRH summer and on Aldabra trials, and an improvement over the mean T-bc recorded during the ZRH winter trial (21.2 degrees C). The smaller individuals reached the upper limits of T-bc recommended for the species, probably due to heating pad temperatures above Ta-opt. We discuss current practices to provide external heating sources for tortoises and how this method can be used to provide an adequate thermal environment for large captive reptiles. Finally, we provide recommendations for the installation of artificial heating sources for tortoises and large reptiles.

AB  - Recent research has uncovered many complex cognitive traits and affective processes in many reptile species, such as the ability to make choices that are rewarding or pleasurable. The investigation herein was initiated after many years of anecdotal reports, and preliminary observations, that the two male Aldabran giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea), Wilbur and Little John, at Melbourne Zoo (Melbourne, Australia) would approach the fence-line of their enclosure, sometimes multiple times daily, to "solicit" interactions from zoo visitors and/or zoo staff. Following other research with Galapagos giant tortoises (Geochelone nigra), this experiment was a novel preference test with two male Aldabran giant tortoises to assess their individual preferences for three stimuli: (1) human interaction (shell and neck rubs provided using hands); (2) food (highly palatable carrot pieces); and (3) an "enrichment" ball (a red "boomer ball"). The results found that Wilbur highly preferred human interaction and food over the ball; whereas Little John preferred food, and showed some initial interest in the ball, but did not approach the human on any of his 13 human interaction trials. These results reflect previous published findings, that human interaction is a preferred "enrichment," but is dependent upon a multitude of other contextual factors, and is not preferred at all times by all individuals. Individual variation may be very important to understand to have greater positive effect on the welfare-related needs of each giant tortoise housed in captivity. Further research is clearly required to enhance the welfare and well-being of many types of zoo-housed reptiles.

AB  - Background: Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) are the second largest giant tortoise species, and their general anatomy is comparable to that of other chelonian species. They are endemic to the Seychelles Islands, in the Indian Ocean. A steep decrease in the numbers of Aldabra giant tortoises has been seen over the years.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to establish electrocardiographic reference values in non-anaesthetized Aldabra giant tortoises.
   Materials and methods: 5 young adults, 1 male and 4 females between 15 and 20 years of age at the Budapest Zoo and Botanical Garden participated in the study. Their body weight ranged from 82 kg to 104 kg. The electrocardiograms were recorded between 10-12 a.m. A total of 4 alligator clip electrodes, two in the front to the skin folds between the neck and the front legs, and two in the back between the hind legs and tail, were applied to the skin folds for the electrocardiographic measurements.
   Results and discussion: The mean heart rate was 22 +/- 1.09 bpm with a range of 20 to 23 bpm. All recorded rhythms were regular sinus rhythms. The P wave was positive in all six leads (where it was measurable in case of three tortoises), however its amplitude was less than 0.5 mV. Out of the three patients that had detectable P waves, each wave had an amplitude of less than 0.1 mV, and all three P wave lengths were measured at 40 ms consistently. R waves were detected in all 5 animals. Q, S, T, and SV waves were not measurable. The R waves showed a length of 240 (+/-25) ms, and average sensitivity of 0.3 (+/-0.07) mV. The knowledge of ECG reference values could help to monitor anaesthesia as well as to diagnose and potentially treat pathological cardiac arrhythmias.

AB  - Aldabra Atoll has the largest population of giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) in the world. As such an important biological resource, it is necessary to understand how the effects of climate change will impact this keystone species; in particular the frequency of drought, which is likely to affect tortoise habitat. To assess whether drought frequency has changed over the last 50 years on Aldabra, we calculated the standardized precipitation index (SPI) to identify drought periods using monthly rainfall data collected during 1969-2013. We found that drought frequency has increased to more than six drought months per year today compared with about two months per year in the 1970s (t = 2.884, p = 0.006). We used MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy for vegetation activity, to determine how vegetation has responded to the changing drought frequency between 2000 and 2013. We found that Aldabra's vegetation is highly responsive to changes in rainfall: anomalies in long-term mean monthly NDVI across Aldabra were found to decrease below the mean during most drought periods and increase above the mean during most non-drought periods. To investigate the response of tortoise habitat to rainfall, we extracted mean NDVI anomalies for three key habitat types. Open mixed scrub and grasslands, the preferred habitat of tortoises, showed the greatest decrease in vegetation activity during drought periods, and the greatest increase in average greenness during non-drought periods. Recent analysis has shown vegetation changes on Aldabra in recent decades. If these changes are caused by decreased precipitation, then the increased frequency of drought could impact the tortoise population, in both the short and long term, by limiting the quality and quantity of forage and/or shade availability within favoured habitats, and by changing the habitat composition across the atoll.

AB  - Tick species density and diversity on Aldabran tortoises was investigated in relation to the habitat range and size of each tortoise. Identification of tick infestation patterns forms an important aspect of effective tick control. Ten Aldabran tortoises were de-ticked and monitored over the course of 2 months. Tick species found were Amblyomma sparsum, Amblyomma nuttalli, Amblyomma hebraeum and Boophilus decoloratus, with the most prevalent species found being A. sparsum. Tick loads varied considerably from 20 to 214 ticks per tortoise, with most ticks collected from the head/neck region. Tortoises ranging outside Haller Park had higher tick loads (70-214) compared with tortoises ranging within Haller Park (20-99). Tick load was not correlated with tortoise size. Results indicate that tick loads are related to the habitat range of the tortoises and may indirectly also be related to food preference and host food availability. Implications of the findings and appropriate tick control measures are discussed.

AB  - Remains of testudinoids from Toropi/Yupoi Formation (ca. 58-28 ka), including testudinids and emydids, were recovered from Arroyo Toropi and Santa Lucia localities (Corrientes Province, northeastern Argentina). From Arroyo Toropi two specimens of testudinid are known: the holotype of Chelonoidis lutzae (carapace, plastron and remains of the appendicular skeleton) and a partial carapace tentatively referred to this species. New specimens including remains of testudinids (cf. Chelonoidis) and emydids (Trachemys cf. T. dorbigni) have been also recovered from Santa Lucia. Comparing the global distribution of extant species of giant testudinids (e.g. Chelonoidis nigra, Geochelone sukata, Dipsochelys elephantina and Cylindraspis peltastes) with the climate map of Kottek and collaborators, show congruence with the Tropical and Subtropical zones, characterized by warm climate. This suggests a high degree of theritosensitivity for these extant giant tortoises. This, together with the geological and paleontological data from Toropi/Yupoi Formation, allows suggesting that the giant Chelonoidis inhabited environments with warm climate conditions. In addition, warm and wet conditions are inferred in Santa Lucia from the record of Trachemys cf. dorbigni.

AB  - Although some studies investigated lateralization in reptiles, little research has been done on chelonians, focusing only on few behaviours such as righting response and escape preference. The aim of this study was to investigate lateralization in Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea), focusing on asymmetrical positioning of the limbs and the head during resting behaviour, called sleep-like behaviour, involving both wild tortoises and individuals under human care. Subjects of the study were 67 adult Aldabra tortoises (54 free ranging on Curieuse, 13 under human care in Mahe Botanical Garden). For each tortoise observed during sleep-like behaviour, we recorded the position of the head (on the left, on the right or in line with the body midline) and we collected which forelimb and hindlimb were kept forward. Moreover, the number of subjects in which limbs were in a symmetrical position during the sleep-like behaviour was recorded. Based on our results, the number of tortoises with asymmetrical position of head and limb was higher (head: 63%; forelimbs: 88%; hindlimbs: 70%) than the number of tortoises with symmetrical position of the head and the limb. Regarding the head, throughout the subjects found with the asymmetrical position of the head during sleep-like behaviour, tortoises positioning the head on the right (42%) were more than those sleeping with the head on the left (21%). We found a relationship between the position of the forelimbs and hindlimbs during sleep-like behaviour. We reported no differences between Mahe (under human care) and Curieuse (wild) tortoises. Findings of this preliminary study underlined traces of group-level lateralization in head positioning during the sleep-like behaviour, possibly due to a left-eye/right-hemisphere involvement in anti-predatory responses and threatening stimuli as reported in reptiles and other vertebrates. This study aims at adding data on brain lateralization, often linked to lateralized behaviours, in reptiles, especially in chelonians.

AB  - Tetrameric hemoglobins (Hbs) A and D were isolated from red blood cells of the Aldabra giant tortoises, Geochelone gigantea, by a hydrophobic interaction chromatography. After reduction and S-pyridylethylation, two sets of two types of alpha -chains (alpha -1 and alpha -2) and one beta -chain were purified from the major Hb A and minor Hb D in molar ratios of about 1:1:2, respectively, by a reversed-phase column chromatography. The complete amino acid sequences of the three globin-chains from Hb A were determined: 141 amino acid residues for the two alpha -chains and 146 amino acid residues for the beta -chain. Using computer analysis (amino acid maximum homology), the two alpha -chains shared a 96.5% sequence identity and had low sequence identities (37.8% for alpha -1 and 35.8% for alpha -2) with the beta -chain of the same species, G. gigantea.
   We constructed a phylogenetic tree of 28 primary globin structures from Reptilia (7 species of squamates, 4 species of turtles, 3 species of crocodiles and 1 species of sphenodontids), including the three globins of G. gigantea Hb A. The following results were obtained: (1) The two terrestrial species of Geochelone (G. gigantea and G. carbonaria) were closely related: 139 amino acid residues (95.2%) of the two beta -globin chains were conserved; (2) Based on the divergence patterns of globin-chains, the sea turtle Caretta caretta was shown to be unusual relatedness form the groups of terrestrial and freshwater species in turtles. The molecular relationships appearing on the phylogenetic tree also support the traditional classification of reptiles and partly confirm previous molecular studies of reptilian hemoglobin evolution.

AB  - Simple Summary There are many studies that suggest that a range of animal species have personalities, and that animals can benefit from interactions with their human caregivers. However, many of these previous studies have focused only on mammals, with fewer studies focusing on reptiles. Research was undertaken at the Faunistic Park Le Cornelle, Italy, to investigate the effects of approach tests and food interaction events on 5 male and 5 female Aldabra tortoises' (Aldrabrachelys gigantea) behavior. There were differences in behavior between tortoises, and in response to different types of events. The tortoises also responded differently to their own keepers, vets, or unfamiliar people. The personality of the tortoises were also quantified using principal component analysis. Overall, the study revealed that individuals acted significantly differently to one another, and that while females initially appeared to display a greater number of shy behaviors, this was not consistent across the group. PCA revealed two personality dimensions in the tortoises, boldness and avoidance. Overall, the study revealed that the tortoises possessed personalities that were independent of sex or scenario. The study also revealed that many tortoises chose to interact with their keepers during training and approach tests: this suggests that human-tortoise interactions may have some enrichment value. Future research could quantify tortoise personality in other scenarios, such as in social interactions with other tortoises. Human-animal interaction (HAI) can be valuable for captive animals, and many zoo-housed species benefit from interactions with their keepers. There is also an increasing body of evidence that some animal species possess personalities that are temporally consistent. However, the majority of zoo research, particularly on personality and HAI, traditionally has focused on mammals, and there are comparatively fewer studies on reptiles. Research was undertaken at the Faunistic Park Le Cornelle, Italy, to investigate the effects of approach tests and food interaction events on 5 male and 5 female Aldabra tortoise (Aldrabrachelys gigantea) behavior. During human-tortoise interactions, continuous focal sampling of behavior took place. The behavioral differences between individual tortoises, interaction type (approach or training) and person involved in the interaction (keeper, vet, or observer) were analysed using general linear mixed-effects models. The personality components of the tortoises were also quantified using principal component analysis. Overall, the study revealed that individuals acted significantly differently to one another, and that while females initially appeared to display a greater number of shy behaviors, this was not consistent across the group. PCA revealed two personality dimensions in the tortoises: boldness and avoidance. Overall, the study revealed that the tortoises possessed personalities that were independent of sex or scenario. The study also revealed that many tortoises chose to interact with their keepers during training and approach tests: this suggests that human-tortoise interactions may have some enrichment value. Future research could quantify tortoise personality in other scenarios such as in social interactions with other tortoises.

AB  - The reproductive activities of one adult female Galapagos tortoise (Geochelone nigra) and three adult female Aldabra tortoises (Geochelone gigantea) were monitored over 2 yr using ultrasound scanning. A nonrestraining technique of tactile stimulation was used for all examinations. Developing, preovulatory, and atretic ovarian follicles, as well as eggs at various stages of shell deposition, were identified and measured. In G. nigra, follicles became preovulatory at a diameter of 40-42 mm and eggs were laid 34-84 days (mean = 55.6, n = 5) after the thin-shelled eggs were first detected in the oviducts. Geochelone nigra was capable of retaining eggs, with the shell already formed, until the next breeding season. No eggs have been produced by G. gigantea during their stay in Zurich Zoo although follicles of 38-40 mm have been observed frequently in two animals.

AB  - Case Description-A female Aldabra tortoise (Geochelone gigantea) was evaluated because of focal necrosis of the carapace.
   Clinical Findings-Debridement revealed a 14.5 X 11.5-cm area of shell necrosis, deep abscess formation, and osteomyelitis involving bacterial (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas spp) and fungal pathogens.
   Treatment and Outcome-Following extensive debridement, vacuum-assisted closure incorporating silver-impregnated bandaging materials was used. The wound was considered healed after 55 days, at which time a layer of epidermal tissue with progressing keratinization was present, with smooth underlying ossification. Keratinization with normal pigmentation continued over the next 67 days.
   Clinical Relevance-Findings suggested that vacuum-assisted closure with silver-impregnated bandaging materials may provide advantages over traditional methods in the treatment of shell lesions in chelonians, including faster wound healing, improved cosmetic appearance of the healed wound, superior control of microbial contamination, and lower overall treatment costs.

AB  - The extinctions of keystone megafauna during the Pleistocene and Holocene continue to affect extant species and ecosystems. This is particularly acute in southern and western Madagascar where two now extinct species of giant tortoises were once amongst the most dominant herbivores. The extinct giant tortoises are likely to have influenced ecosystem processes by being effective dispersers of large seeds, keeping the understorey open, cycling nutrients, and indirectly regulating fire regimes. As a result of their extinction, ecological interactions and ecosystems have been altered. Given that there is evidence that the extant Aldabran giant tortoise, Aldabrachelys gigantea, is closely related to at least one of these Madagascan giant tortoises, Aldabrachelys abrupta, we propose using captive Aldabran giant tortoises to restore missing ecological functions. This ambitious approach will represent the first continental island restoration project with a surviving lineage of now extinct, endemic megafauna. Translocation of this megafauna species could be a pragmatic and cost-effective tool to contribute to halting the ongoing extinction processes in parts of western and southern Madagascar, and would further understanding of the role of these species in pre-human Madagascan ecosystems.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that restoration ecologists should be most concerned with restoring species interactions rather than species diversity per se [1]. Rewilding with taxon substitutes, the intentional introduction of exotic species to replace the ecosystem functions of recently extinct species, is one way to reverse ecosystem dysfunction following the loss of species interactions [2]. This is highly controversial [3], in part because of a lack of rigorous scientific studies [4]. Here we present the first empirical evidence of an in situ rewilding project undertaken as a hypothesis-driven ecosystem management option. On lle aux Aigrettes, a 25-hectare island off Mauritius, the critically endangered large-fruited endemic ebony, Diospyros egrettarum (Ebenaceae), was seed-dispersal limited after the extinction of all native large-bodied frugivores, including giant tortoises. We introduced exotic Aldabra giant tortoises, Aldabrachelys gigantea, to disperse the ebony seeds. Not only did the tortoises ingest the large fruits and disperse substantial numbers of ebony seeds, but tortoise gut passage also improved seed germination, leading to the widespread, successful establishment of new ebony seedlings. Our results demonstrate that the introduction of these exotic frugivores is aiding the recovery of ebonies. We argue for more reversible rewilding experiments to investigate whether extinct species interactions can be restored.

AB  - The first part of the article gives a review of injection anesthesia in reptiles. The specific anatomy and physiology of reptiles are briefly described, along with their pre-anesthetic evaluation. Drugs used for premedication, muscle relaxation, local anesthesia and the induction of general anesthesia are discussed. The last section deals with analgesia in reptiles.
   Chelonians are relatively difficult to anesthetize so injection anesthesia is of great value in this species. Midazolam/ketamine or an alpha(2)-agonist (medetomidine, xylazine) / ketamine combination can be used successfully. Propofol I.V. or I.O. is the agent of choice for induction and minor surgeries not exceeding 20 minutes. In large tortoises (eg. Aldabrachelys gigantea) a muscle relaxant may be indicated to facilitate handling of the head and intubation. Ketamine and zolazepam/tiletamine (zoletil, tilazol) I.M. are indicated as premedication in snakes. Propofol I.V. and even methoxital I.M. or S.C can be used for induction and small interventions. In lizards, easy access to the tail and abdominal veins assure intravenous access. For this reason, propofol is mostly used for induction and smaller surgical interventions. Ketamine and alphaloxone/alphadolone I.M. are good alternatives. Since problems often occur with gas induction, injection anesthesia is usually obligatory in these species before inhalation anesthesia can be performed.

AB  - Today, the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Aldabra Atoll is home to about 100 000 giant tortoises, Aldabrachelys gigantea, whose fossil record goes back to the Late Pleistocene. New Late Pleistocene fossils (age ca. 90-125 000 years) from the atoll revealed some appendicular bones and numerous shell fragments of giant tortoises and cranial and postcranial elements of crocodylians. Several tortoise bones show circular holes, pits and scratch marks that are interpreted as bite marks of crocodylians. The presence of a Late Pleistocene crocodylian species, Aldabrachampsus dilophus, has been known for some time, but the recently found crocodylian remains presented herein are distinctly larger than those previously described. This indicates the presence of at least some larger crocodylians, either of the same or of a different species, on the atoll. These larger crocodylians, likely the apex predators in the Aldabra ecosystem at the time, were well capable of inflicting damage on even very large giant tortoises. We thus propose an extinct predator-prey interaction between crocodylians and giant tortoises during the Late Pleistocene, when both groups were living sympatrically on Aldabra, andwe discuss scenarios for the crocodylians directly attacking the tortoises or scavenging on recently deceased animals.

AB  - The homology model of hemoglobin D from Geochelone carbonaria, the red-footed tortoise was predicted using the 3D structure coordinates of Geochelone gigantea hemoglobin D as the template. The model was built using the program, MODELLER (8v1) and evaluated with PROCHECK and PROSA. The present study features an in-depth analysis of the 3D model and its conformational changes brought about with variations in its environment. These structural changes are correlated with its ability to adapt to different environmental constraints enabling the organism to better suit to its natural habitat. The model shows additional contacts between amino acid pairs of alpha-119 and beta-55, alpha-35 and beta-124, alpha-103 and beta-112, alpha-115 and beta-116, alpha-120 and beta-52, alpha-120 and beta-55, alpha-36 and beta-127 which are not found in human hemoglobin. It is predicted that these contacts may result in T-state stabilization thus lowering oxygen affinity. Furthermore, decrease in the interaction of phosphate heteroatoms with the amino acid residues of G. carbonaria Hb was also predicted in this study.

AB  - Red blood cells of yellow-spotted river turtles (Podocnemis unifilis, Pleurodira, Chelonia, REPTILIA) have two hemoglobin (Hb) components, Hb A and Hb D. We purified the hemoglobin component homologous to amniote (reptiles, birds, and mammals) adult Hb A which comprises two identical alpha(A)-globin polypeptides and two identical beta-globin polypeptides. To establish the crystal structure of Podocnemis Hb A, we first determined the globin primary structures using cDNA nucleotide sequencing with the assistance of protein sequencing. The purified Podocnemis Hb A produced a different form of crystal for each of the two different buffer systems used: form A, tetragonal crystals (space group, P4(1)2(1)2), produced under neutral pH (pH 7-8) conditions; and form B, hexagonal crystals (space group, P6122), produced under high alkaline pH (pH 11-13) conditions. Single crystals of the two forms were examined by Raman microscopy with an excitation of 532 nm, indicating their structural differences. The crystal structures of the two forms were constructed by X-ray crystallographic diffraction at a resolution of 2.20 angstrom for form A and 2.35 angstrom for form B. The differences of the tertiary and quaternary structures of the two forms were marginal; however, one clear difference was found in helix structure. When comparing Podocnemis Hb A with Hb A from specimens in other taxa, such as Anser indicus (birds) and Homo sapiens (mammals) by SHELXPRO, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the corresponding C alpha atoms of the two globins does not exceed 2.0 angstrom. These low values indicate the crystal structures resemble each other. Our data on X-ray crystal structures and Raman spectra not only reveal the first findings on the

AB  - At the end of the 19th century, after prolonged and extensive harvesting, indigenous giant tortoises had been eliminated from all islands in the Indian Ocean, except Aldabra atoll, where only a few survived. With greatly reduced levels of exploitation during the 20th century, the population recovered to a revised estimated total of 129 000 in 1973-1974, when the first sample census was conducted. A repeat census in 1997 revealed a highly significant reduction in numbers over the past 24 years to an estimated total of 100 000. The great majority of tortoises are still found at relatively high density in south-eastern Grande Terre, where the number of animals has declined by more than one-third. In contrast, low-density subpopulations on Malabar and Picard have almost doubled in size, but they represent less than 5% of the total population. Corroborative evidence for the crash in the Grande Terre subpopulation comes from two independent observations: a significant increase in tortoise mortality; and a significant decline in tortoise counts on long-term population monitoring transects. These population changes are attributed to natural population regulatory mechanisms, exacerbated by low rainfall years in the period 1980-1997, including two consecutive years of below average rainfall in 1995-1996 and 1996-1997.

AB  - Today, the only surviving wild population of giant tortoises in the Indian Ocean occurs on the island of Aldabra. However, giant tortoises once inhabited islands throughout the western Indian Ocean, Madagascar, Africa, and India have all been suggested as possible sources of colonization for these islands. To address the origin of Indian Ocean tortoises (Dipsochelys, formerly Geochelone gigantea), we sequenced the 12S, 16S, and cyt b genes of the mitochondrial DNA. Our phylogenetic analysis shows Dipsochelys to be embedded within the Malagasy lineage, providing evidence that Indian Ocean giant tortoises are derived from a common Malagasy ancestor. This result points to Madagascar as the source of colonization for western Indian Ocean islands by giant tortoises. Tortoises are known to survive long oceanic voyages by floating with ocean currents, and thus, currents flowing northward towards the Aldabra archipelago from the east coast of Madagascar would have provided means for the colonization of western Indian Ocean islands. Additionally, we found an accelerated rate of sequence evolution in the two Malagasy Pyxis species examined. This finding supports previous theories that shorter generation time and smaller body size are related to an increase in mitochondrial DNA substitution rate in vertebrates.

AB  - We studied the temperature relations of wild and zoo Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) focusing on (1) the relationship between environmental temperature and tortoise activity patterns (n=8 wild individuals) and (2) on tortoise body temperature fluctuations, including how their core and external body temperatures vary in relation to different environmental temperature ranges (seasons; n=4 wild and n=5 zoo individuals). In addition, we surveyed the literature to review the effect of body mass on core body temperature range in relation to environmental temperature in the Testudinidae. Diurnal activity of tortoises was bimodally distributed and influenced by environmental temperature and season. The mean air temperature at which activity is maximized was 27.9 degrees C, with a range of 25.8-31.7 degrees C. Furthermore, air temperature explained changes in the core body temperature better than did mass, and only during the coldest trial, did tortoises with higher mass show more stable temperatures. Our results, together with the overall Testudinidae overview, suggest that, once variation in environmental temperature has been taken into account, there is little effect of mass on the temperature stability of tortoises. Moreover, the presence of thermal inertia in an individual tortoise depends on the environmental temperatures, and we found no evidence for inertial homeothermy. Finally, patterns of core and external body temperatures in comparison with environmental temperatures suggest that Aldabra giant tortoises act as mixed conformer-regulators. Our study provides a baseline to manage the thermal environment of wild and rewilded populations of an important island ecosystem engineer species in an era of climate change.

AB  - Differences in the allometric scaling between gut capacity (with body mass. BM1.00) and food intake (with BM0.75) should theoretically result in a scaling of digesta retention time with BM0.25 and therefore a higher digestive efficiency in larger herbivores. This concept is an important part of the so-called 'Jarman-Bell principle' (JBP) that explains niche differentiation along a body size gradient in terms of digestive physiology. Empirical data in herbivorous mammals, however, do not confirm the scaling of retention time, or of digestive efficiency, with body mass. Here, we test these concepts in herbivorous reptiles, adding data of an experiment that measured food intake, digesta retention, digestibility and gut capacity in 23 tortoises (Testudo graeca, T. hermanni, Geochelone nigra, G. sulcata, Dipsochelys dussumieri) across a large BM range (0.5-180 kg) to a literature data collection. While dry matter gut fill scaled to BM1.07 and dry matter intake to BM0.76, digesta mean retention time (MRT) scaled to BM0.17; the scaling exponent was not significantly different from zero for species >1 kg. Food intake level was a major determinant of MRT across reptiles and mammals. In contrast to dietary fibre level. BM was not a significant contributor to dry matter digestibility in a General Linear Model. Digestibility coefficients in reptiles depended on diet nutrient composition in a similar way as described in mammals. Although food intake is generally lower and digesta retention longer in reptiles than in mammals, digestive functions scale in a similar way in both clades, indicating universal principles in herbivore digestive physiology. The reasons why the theoretically derived JBP has little empirical support remain to be investigated. Until then, the JBP should not be evoked to explain niche differentiation along a body size axis in terms of digestive physiology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. The use of ecological replacements (analogue species to replace extinct taxa) to restore ecosystem functioning is a promising conservation tool. However, this approach is controversial, in part due to a paucity of data on interactions between analogue species and established taxa in the ecosystem.
   2. We conducted ecological surveys, comprehensively DNA barcoded an ecosystem's flora and inferred the diet of the introduced Aldabra giant tortoise, acting as an ecological replacement, to understand how it might have modified island plant communities on a Mauritian islet. Through further dietary analyses, we investigated consequential effects on the threatened endemic Telfair's skink.
   3. Dietary overlap between tortoises and skinks was greater than expected by chance. However, there was a negative correlation between tortoise and skink preferences in herbivory and minimal overlap in the plants most frequently consumed by the reptiles.
   4. Changes in the plant community associated with 7 years of tortoise grazing were characterised by a decrease in the percentage cover of native herbs and creepers, and an increase in the cover of an invasive herb when compared to areas without tortoises. However, tortoise dietary preferences themselves did not directly drive changes in the plant community.
   5. Tortoises successfully dispersed the seeds of an endemic palm, which in time may increase the extent of unique palm-rich habitat. We found no evidence that tortoises have increased the extent of plant species hypothesised to be part of a lost Mauritian tortoise grazed community.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Due to a negative correlation in tortoise and skink dietary preferences and minimal overlap in the most frequently consumed taxa, the presence of tortoises is unlikely to have detrimental impacts on Telfair's skinks. Tortoise presence is likely to be beneficial to skinks in the long term by increasing the extent of palm-rich habitat. Although tortoises are likely to play a role in controlling invasive plants, they are not a panacea for this challenge. After 7 years, tortoises have not resurrected a lost tortoise grazed community that we hypothesise might have existed in limited areas on the islet, indicating that further interventions may be required to restore this plant community.

AB  - The giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys or Dipsochelys) of the Indian Ocean Islands have been in decline since the first human settlement of the islands. They retain only a single natural population on Aldabra Atoll (and possibly Ile aux Cerfs, where tortoises are descendants of a mixture of indigenous and imported animals). Several additional wild populations are known, resulting from reintroductions to the historic range and introductions outside of that range. The historical distribution of tortoises in Seychelles is summarized, with reliable tortoise records from only 4 coralline islands and 23 granitic islands and the status of all the wild populations reviewed. This includes the first census of the Fregate Island population. In the granitic islands, only 9 islands support tortoises today and the wild population of these islands is estimated at 500-550 adults. In the coralline islands, tortoises are now present on 11 islands, with a total population of over 100,000 (almost all on Aldabra). Climate change impacts over the next 100 yrs are expected to be severe in low-lying areas of the Seychelles Islands attributable to sea-level rise and storm impacts on coastal erosion. These are projected to result in the loss of many populations and significant declines in the Aldabra population. As a result, the species should be regarded as Vulnerable by IUCN Red List Threat Criteria. Reintroduction to more of the high granitic islands could offset some of these projected declines, and it is recommended that such reintroductions be included in future conservation programs to restore ecosystem function.

AB  - We argue that the introduction of non-native extant tortoises as ecological replacements for extinct giant tortoises is a realistic restoration management scheme, which is easy to implement. We discuss how the recent extinctions of endemic giant Cylindraspis tortoises on the Mascarene Islands have left a legacy of ecosystem dysfunction threatening the remnants of native biota, focusing on the island of Mauritius because this is where most has been inferred about plant-tortoise interactions. There is a pressing need to restore and preserve several Mauritian habitats and plant communities that suffer from ecosystem dysfunction. We discuss ongoing restoration efforts on the Mauritian offshore Round Island, which provide a case study highlighting how tortoise substitutes are being used in an experimental and hypothesis-driven conservation and restoration project. The immediate conservation concern was to prevent the extinction and further degradation of Round Island's threatened flora and fauna. In the long term, the introduction of tortoises to Round Island will lead to valuable management and restoration insights for subsequent larger-scale mainland restoration projects. This case study further highlights the feasibility, versatility and low-risk nature of using tortoises in restoration programs, with particular reference to their introduction to island ecosystems. Overall, the use of extant tortoises as replacements for extinct ones is a good example of how conservation and restoration biology concepts applied at a smaller scale can be microcosms for more grandiose schemes and addresses more immediate conservation priorities than large-scale ecosystem rewilding projects.

AB  - The extinction of large herbivores, often keystone species, can dramatically modify plant communities and impose key biotic thresholds that may prevent an ecosystem returning to its previous state and threaten native biodiversity. A potentially innovative, yet controversial, landscape-based long-term restoration approach is to replace missing plant-herbivore interactions with non-native herbivores. Aldabran giant (Aldabrachelys gigantea) and Madagascan radiated (Astrochelys radiata) tortoises, taxonomically and functionally similar to the extinct Mauritian giant tortoises (Cylindraspis spp.), were introduced to Round Island, Mauritius, in 2007 to control the non-native plants that were threatening persistence of native species. We monitored the response of the plant community to tortoise grazing for 11 months in enclosures before the tortoises were released and, compared the cost of using tortoises as weeders with the cost of using manual labor. At the end of this period, plant biomass; vegetation height and cover; and adult, seedling, flower, and seed abundance were 3-136 times greater in adjacent control plots than in the tortoise enclosures. After their release, the free-roaming tortoises grazed on most non-native plants and significantly reduced vegetation cover, height, and seed production, reflecting findings from the enclosure study. The tortoises generally did not eat native species, although they consumed those native species that increased in abundance following the eradication of mammalian herbivores. Our results suggest that introduced non-native tortoises are a more cost-effective approach to control non-native vegetation than manual weeding. Numerous long-term outcomes (e.g., change in species composition and soil seed bank) are possible following tortoise releases. Monitoring and adaptive management are needed to ensure that the replacement herbivores promote the recovery of native plants.

AB  - Background: Ecological replacement involves the introduction of non-native species to habitats beyond their historical range, a factor identified as increasing the risk of failure for translocations. Yet the effectiveness and success of ecological replacement rely in part on the ability of translocatees to adapt, survive and potentially reproduce in a novel environment. We discuss the welfare aspects of translocating captive-reared non-native tortoises, Aldabrachelys gigantea and Astrochelys radiata, to two offshore Mauritian islands, and the costs and success of the projects to date.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Because tortoises are long-lived, late-maturing reptiles, we assessed the progress of the translocation by monitoring the survival, health, growth, and breeding by the founders. Between 2000 and 2011, a total of 26 A. gigantea were introduced to Ile aux Aigrettes, and in 2007 twelve sexually immature A. gigantea and twelve male A. radiata were introduced to Round Island, Mauritius. Annual mortality rates were low, with most animals either maintaining or gaining weight. A minimum of 529 hatchlings were produced on Ile aux Aigrettes in 11 years; there was no potential for breeding on Round Island. Project costs were low. We attribute the success of these introductions to the tortoises' generalist diet, habitat requirements, and innate behaviour.
   Conclusions/Significance: Feasibility analyses for ecological replacement and assisted colonisation projects should consider the candidate species' welfare during translocation and in its recipient environment. Our study provides a useful model for how this should be done. In addition to serving as ecological replacements for extinct Mauritian tortoises, we found that releasing small numbers of captive-reared A. gigantea and A. radiata is cost-effective and successful in the short term. The ability to release small numbers of animals is a particularly important attribute for ecological replacement projects since it reduces the potential risk and controversy associated with introducing non-native species.

AB  - Aims
   The use of exotic species as taxon substitutes to restore lost ecological interactions is currently hotly debated. Aldabrachelys gigantea giant tortoises have recently been introduced to three islands in the Mascarene archipelago (Ile aux Aigrettes, Round Island and Rodrigues) to resurrect herbivory and seed dispersal functions once performed by extinct giant tortoises. However, potential unintended impacts by frugivore substitutes on native ecosystems, e. g. whether they will facilitate the germination of exotic plant species, are largely unknown. We investigated whether A. gigantea introduced to Rodrigues in 2006 could enhance the germination percentage of four widespread fleshy-fruited exotic species on the island. Using germination trials to forecast unintended impacts that could arise from the introduction of a frugivorous taxon substitute enables conservation managers to limit potential adverse negative interactions before they occur.
   Methods
   In germination trials that ran over 4 months, we investigated the effects of ingestion (gut passage and deposition in faeces) by sub-adult and adult A. gigantea on the germination percentage of four exotic fleshy-fruited plant species introduced to Rodrigues. We fed fruits of these plant species to sub-adult and adult A. gigantea to test how variation in age and size of the frugivore would affect seed germination. Feeding of distinctly coloured plastic pellets together with the fruits allowed us to test for individual tortoise effects on seed germination.
   Important Findings
   Ingestion by A. gigantea increased the percentage of seeds germinating of Mimusops coriacea and Lantana camara, but not percentage of germination of Veitchia merrillii or Wikstroemia indica. Seeds were more likely to germinate following ingestion by sub-adult rather than adult tortoises, which may be a consequence of the shorter gut passage time observed for sub-adults. Our results demonstrate that introduced frugivorous taxon substitutes could facilitate germination of exotic and invasive plants and highlight the need for conservation managers to weigh the risk of taxon substitutes potentially facilitating the germination and recruitment of exotic fleshy-fruited plants against the benefit of restoring lost seed dispersal functions of threatened indigenous plants. Our findings also highlight the importance of considering age and size variation in frugivores, in particular in long-lived taxa such as giant tortoises, when studying ingestion effects on the germination performance of plants.
