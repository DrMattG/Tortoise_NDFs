AB  - ABSTRACT Eighty three Speke's hinged tortoise were studied by mark-recapture methods in the Boulton Atlantica Researeh Station, near Harare, Zimbabwe. The population was estimated to total 130 +/- 33 individuals, with an average density of 2.25 tortoises per hectare. The sex ratio was 2.6:1 F:M., but this may be biased due to increased female activity in open grassland during the wet season. Tortoises were fairly uniformly distributed over the study site, but there may be differences in seasonal habitat utilization by the sexes. Adult males may move from wooded grassland in the wet season to pure woodland during the dry winter. Females showed a similar trend, with a decrease in occurrence in open grassland between the wet and dry season. The diet comprised Hyparrhenia grass, with succulent and semi-suceulent shrubs and forbs, with occasional mahobohobo fruit (Uapaca kirkiana) and millipedes. Thirteen tortoises were recaptured a total of 19 times. The shortest movement was 80m, the greatest 820m; several e...

AB  - Objective The naked mole rat (NMR) (Heterocephalus glaber) is increasingly considered an important biomedical research model for various conditions like hypoxic brain injury, cancer and nociception. This study was designed to investigate the effects of clonidine and yohimbine, an alpha-2 (α2) adrenoceptor agonist and antagonist respectively in the tail flick and hot plate tests. Results A significant difference in tail flick latency was noted between saline control and 30 µg/kg clonidine, which was reduced after administration of 30 µg/kg yohimbine. A significant difference in hot plate latency was also noted between saline control and 30 µg/kg clodinine during the periods 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 min after administration, and between saline control and 10 µg/kg clonidine during 30 min after administration. The hot plate latency by 30 µg/kg clonidine was also reduced by 30 µg/kg yohimbine during 30 min after administration. Since the tail-flick and hot plate tests mediate the effects at spinal and supraspinal levels respectively, the present study indicates the presence and involvement of noradrenergic receptors in thermal antinociception at spinal and supraspinal levels of the NMR, similar to what has been found in other mammals.

AB  - Little is known about analgesia in lower vertebrates such as the Speke's hinged tortoise (Kinixy's spekii), yet of late they are increasingly being adopted as pets. The effects of morphine (5, 7.5, 10 and 20 mg/kg), pethidine (10, 20, and 50 mg/kg) and naloxone (5 mg/kg) on nociception induced by the formalin test (12.5%, 100 microL) were studied in the Speke's hinged tortoise. Formalin induced a monophasic limb retraction behavioural response and its duration was recorded. The behaviour lasted for 16.4 +/- 0.8 min. Morphine (7.5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) and pethidine (20 and 50 mg/kg) induced significant decrease in the duration of limb retraction in the formalin test. The anti-nociceptive effects were naloxone (5 mg/kg) reversible. The data suggest that the formalin test is a good test for studying nociception and anti-nociception in tortoises and that the opioidergic system plays a role in the control of nociception in these animals.

AB  - ABSTRACT The peak of the elevated oxygen consumption following feeding may be preabsorptive in some reptiles, possibly because of the up‐regulation of gut function. The question of whether up‐regulation has a substantial net cost and accounts for a large part of the cost of the specific dynamic action can be resolved by comparing the response to single and repeated meals. Oxygen consumption of the omnivorous tortoise Kini‐xys spekii was elevated for 3–4 d after a single meal, and the peak occurred while most food was still in the stomach. The cost of the specific dynamic action varied between diets, being 16%, 21%, and 30% of the energy absorbed from fungi, leaves, and millipedes, respectively, but was about 0.8 L O2 g−1 absorbed protein for all diets. The specific dynamic action doubled during continuous feeding on leaves and then accounted for 42% of the absorbed energy. The increase after repeated feeding shows that up‐regulation of gut function can contribute little to the energy cost of the specific ...

AB  - The mean body temperature (Tb) of active Kinixys spekii did not vary with sex or type of activity, or between hot days (maximum ambient temperature Ta > 29°C) and cool days. On hot days, Tb increased rapidly in the morning, and was constant during the late afternoon after midday inactivity. On cool days, Tb increased more slowly in the morning, and decreased during the afternoon. The slopes of Tb on Ta overall, and on hot days, were close to one, suggesting that tortoises were thermoconformers; the slope was greater than one on cool days. In a second test of thermoregulation, Tbs were compared with temperatures of null models (Tm). Tortoises were clearly thermoregulators compared to ‘active-all-day’ models. ‘Activity-time’ models had Tm more similar to Tb. Nevertheless, detailed comparison showed that tortoises were thermoregulating in the late morning, and that this was by choice of microenvironment, rather than ceasing activity when Tb reached a high level. These results are discussed in relation to E, a measure of the effectiveness of thermoregulation based on comparison of Tb and Tm with the set point range (Tset) selected in a thermal gradient. A set of three indices, which separate the variability of Tb, the difference between Tb and Tm, and between Tb and Tset, is suggested as a more generally applicable summary of thermoregulation in ectotherms.

AB  - BACKGROUND There are limited studies on the utilization of analgesics in testudines. Management of pain in reptiles is by use of analgesics generally used in other vertebrate species. Evidently, some analgesics considered to be generally effective in reptiles are not effective in certain reptile species. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of amitriptyline hydrochloride on nociceptive behaviour in Speke's hinge-back tortoise. METHODS Twenty-four adult Speke-hinged tortoises weighing 500-700 g were used. The effects of amitriptyline hydrochloride on nociception were evaluated using the formalin, capsaicin and hot plate nociceptive tests. Amitriptyline was administered intracoelomically at doses of 0.5, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg. RESULTS The higher doses of amitriptyline hydrochloride caused an increase in nociceptive behaviour (time spent in hindlimb withdrawal) on the formalin and capsaicin nociceptive tests, suggesting a potentiating effect. However, the doses used had no significant change in nociceptive behaviour on withdrawal response in the hot plate test. CONCLUSIONS The study showed that amitriptyline hydrochloride which is widely used in management of neuropathic pain potentiates nociceptive effects in the formalin and capsaicin nociceptive tests in the Speke's hinge-back tortoise. The hot plate test, which previously has not been reported in these animals, gave results not in line with the other tests and therefore more testing and validation of the test is required. Amitriptyline modulates chemical and thermal pain differently.

AB  - Live and dead Kinixys spekii were collected in the Sengwa Wildlife Research Area, Zimbabwe over a 12-year period. Live tortoises were sexable at a midline plastron length of 100 mm; females were considered sexually mature at 140 mm (reached by age 9 years) and males at 120 mm (at age 7 years). Adult females were significantly larger than males, on average by 14 mm in length and by 1.43 times in mass. Mark–recapture analysis in a 2 km2 area showed a population density of sexable tortoises of 0.16 ha−1. The survival rate was estimated by recaptures, by the frequency distribution of age at death, and by the mean age of live tortoises, and averaged 0.74 year−1. Seventy-seven to 89% of dead tortoises showed evidence of predation, depending on the criteria used. Damage occurred in characteristic forms, loss of the front or rear of the plastron, or holes in the carapace and plastron, which were attributed to predation by mammals and ground hornbills, respectively. K. spekii had similar body size and sexual size dimorphism to Mediterranean tortoises (Testudo), but population density was much lower and the mortality rate was twice as high, probably due to the abundant African predators. High mortality was offset by a rate of juvenile growth twice that of Testudo.

AB  - Two hypotheses may explain the lack of metabolic depression at low temperature in hibernating reptiles from warm but not cool climates. (1) Physiological ability; reptiles from cool climates have resting metabolic rates elevated at low temperatures and so have greater potential for metabolic depression. (2) Energy benefit; hibernation is generally short in warm climates, so the energy saving possible at low temperature is small. These hypotheses can be separated in a warm-climate reptile that hibernates for a long period, such as the African tortoise Kinixys spekii, which is dormant for 7–8 months a year, in winter and in the following hot dry season. Dormant tortoises had a reduced rate of oxygen consumption between 10 and 25 °C compared with resting measured at the same temperatures in the active season, and at 10–15 °C compared with the resting of controls kept active in winter. These data are consistent with hypothesis 2 but not hypothesis 1. The metabolic rate during dormancy was, on average, 59% of ...

AB  - 1. Mixed diets are common in vertebrates, and may be explained by several hypotheses including the availability and nutrient composition of different types of food, the presence of toxins, associative effects in digestion or non-nutritional factors such as foraging efficiency or predation. This study investigated diet mixing in the omnivorous tortoise Kinixys spekii, which consumes fungi, vascular plants and invertebrates in the field. Tortoises feeding ad libitum on these three diets had a higher intake of digestible energy from fungi than from leaves or millipedes (69, 42 and 31 kJ kg–1 day–1 respectively).



2. Tortoises offered pairwise combinations of foods chose mostly that giving the highest rate of digestible energy intake; 73:27 fungi:leaves, 92:8 fungi:millipedes, and 91:9 leaves:millipedes, by wet mass. Nevertheless, some of the food giving a lower energy intake was eaten.



3. Tortoises feeding ad libitum on a mixed diet (90:10 leaves:millipedes by wet mass) had similar food intake rates and gut retention times to those feeding on leaves. The digestibility of energy was lower for the mixed diet than for diets of leaves or millipedes; a significant negative associative effect.



4. The rate of intake of dry mass did not differ between the three pure diets, the selected diets, or the mixed diet, though this was about 50% higher at 30 °C than outdoors, and represents a limitation due to digestion or appetite. Intake of other foods decreased the intake of dry mass of the preferred food, fungi, by an equal amount.



5. The three foods had similar levels of protein as a proportion of dry mass, partly because of the high ash content of millipedes. The digestibility of protein was higher in millipedes, but the rate of intake of total and of digestible protein was in the same rank order as that of energy (fungi > leaves > millipedes). Although the quantity of protein provided no nutritional explanation for inclusion of lower energy foods in the diet, the quality of protein may differ between food types.



6. Herbivorous tortoises are known to face limitations from calcium and sodium balance. Fungi had a lower level of calcium and a lower ratio of sodium:potassium than leaves; millipedes had values higher than leaves. Foods that are non-optimal in terms of energy are probably included in the diet for micronutrients such as minerals or essential amino acids.

AB  - Invertebrates form an important part of the diet in the omnivorous African tortoises of the genus Kinixys. Millipede prey of Kinixys spekii in Zimbabwe had a mean volume of 0.9 ml, and made up 64.7% of invertebrate food by volume; beetles made up most of the remainder and had a mean volume of 1.4 ml. The mean mass of invertebrate prey was 0.19% of tortoise mass, a similar value of relative prey mass to many insectivorous lizards. Tortoises preferentially attacked moving millipedes at or just behind the head, but predatory behaviour was otherwise unspecialized, with tortoises killing millipedes by ingesting them in pieces. Handling times of millipede prey varied significantly with relative prey mass, defensive behaviour, and direction of ingestion. The profitability (mass intake/handling time) of millipedes was maximal at a relative prey mass of 0.2%; the basis on which prey are selected is discussed.

Les invertebres constituent une grande part du regime alimentaire des tortues africaines omnivores du genre Kinixis. Les mille-pattes qui sont les proies de Kinixis spekii au Zimbabwe ont un volume moyen de 0,9 ml, et constituent 64,7% du volume des invertebres qu’elles consomment; les coleopteres representent a peu pres le reste du volume, et ont un volume moyen de 1,4 ml. La masse moyenne des proies invertebrees etait de 0,19% de la masse des tortues, une valeur semblable a la masse relative des proies de nombreux lezards insectivores. Les tortues attaquaient de preference les mille-pattes en mouvement juste derriere la tete ou a la tete, mais a part cela, leur comportement de predateur n’etait pas specialise, les tortues tuant les mille-pattes et les mangeant par morceaux. Le temps de manipulation de la proie variait significativement en fonction de la taille relative du mille-pattes, de son comportement defensif et du sens de l’ingestion. La profitabilite (masse ingeree/temps de manipulation) des mille-pattes etait maximale lorsque la masse relative de la proie etait de 0,2%; on discute la base sur laquelle les proies sont choisies.

AB  - The study was designed to investigate the involvement of noradrenergic and serotonergic receptor systems in the modulation of formalin-induced pain-related behaviour in the Speke's hinged tortoise. Intradermal injection of 100 μL of formalin at a dilution of 12.5% caused pain-related behaviour (hindlimb withdrawal) that lasted for a mean time of 19.28 min (monophasic response). Intrathecal administration of clonidine (α2-adrenergic receptor agonist) and yohimbine (α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist) at a dose of 40 μg/kg and 37.5 μg/kg or 50 μg/kg, respectively, caused a highly significant reduction in the duration of the formalin-induced pain-related behaviour. The effect of clonidine was reversed by intrathecal administration of yohimbine at a dose of 26.7 μg/kg. The effect of yohimbine at a dose of 50 μg/kg was reversed by intrathecal injection of 20 μg/kg of the serotonergic receptor antagonist methysergide maleate. When performing antagonistic reactions, the administration of the antagonist was followed immediately by that of the agonist. The study indicates that for experimental purposes, intrathecal route of drug administration through the atlanto-occipital joint is effective in tortoises. The data also suggest that testudines have noradrenergic and serotonergic systems that appear to play a role in the modulation of pain in this species.

AB  - Movements of five Kinixys spekii were measured continuously during six weeks of their activity season, by thread-trailing. The mean daily movement distance was negatively correlated with maximum shade air temperature, but not significantly related to minimum temperature, rainfall, or humidity. There was a midday period of inactivity of increasing length as maximum air temperature exceeded 29° C. Temperatures of models suggest that lower activity on hot days was due to the risk of overheating in this small (mean mass 617 g) tortoise. Kinixys spekii had a mean field body temperature (Tb) of 27° C, which is low compared to other tortoises (including sympatric Geochelone pardulis, mean Tb= 32.5° C), but salivated at a similar Tb (38.4° C). This pattern also occurs in other small species; mean and maximum field Tbs of tortoises are positively correlated with body mass, but salivation and critical maximum Tbs do not vary with body mass. Low field Tb provides a wide safety margin before evaporation of water becomes necessary. Kinixys sprkii had a short annual activity period, with about 95% of sightings in four months (December to March). Monthly sightings of K. spekii were correlated with rainfall, but not significantly related to temperature or humidity. Seasonal activity is therefore related to rainfall, but within the rainy season the level and pattern of daily activity is related to temperature.

AB  - Most of the 42 living species of tortoise (Testudinidae) are herbivorous, feeding largely on vascular plants, with the exception of the genus Kinixys, which is omnivorous. A comparison of Kinixys spekii and Geochelone pardalis showed the following significant differences. The large intestine was shorter in K. spekii (86% of plastron length and 1.8% of body mass) than in G. pardalis (246 and 2.5%) and held a smaller proportion of the total gut contents (44 and 62%, respectively). The apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) of organic matter was lower in K. spekii (77%) than in G. pardalis (82%) fed kale; the ADC of holocellulose was higher and did not differ between the two species. Kinixys spekii did not readily consume grass, which is more difficult to digest than kale; the ADC of organic matter was 64% in G. pardalis. The time to first excretion (t0) was lower in K. spekii (2.2 days) than in G. pardalis (3.8 days). Other measures of retention time (t50, tmax, and ) did not differ between the species, o...

AB  - Some of the most commonly used analgesic drugs in animals are of questionable efficacy or present adverse side effects among the various species of reptiles. Tricyclic antidepressants have been demonstrated to have antinociceptive effects in several animal models of pain and could be a good alternative for use in reptiles. The aim of the study was to investigate the antinociceptive effects of nortriptyline and desipramine hydrochloride in Speke's hinge-back tortoise. A total of 24 animals weighing 600-1000 g were used for nociceptive tests, i.e., formalin, capsaicin, and hot plate tests. Drugs were administered intracoelomically 30 min before starting the tests. The time spent in nocifensive behavior and the associated observable effects during the tests were recorded. Only the highest dose of 40 mg/kg of nortriptyline hydrochloride caused statistically significant decrease in nocifensive behavior in both the formalin and the capsaicin test. Desipramine hydrochloride at doses of 20 and 40 mg/kg caused statistically significant decrease in nocifensive behavior in the formalin test. Also, desipramine hydrochloride at doses of 15, 20, and 60 mg/kg caused statistically significant decrease in nocifensive behavior in the capsaicin test. None of the doses used for both drugs had any statistically significant effect on nocifensive behavior in the hot plate test. The results show that nortriptyline and desipramine hydrochloride have significant antinociceptive effects in the chemical but not thermal inflammatory pain-related behavior in the Speke's hinge-back tortoise. The most common associated side effect following administration of the higher doses of either of the drugs is excessive salivation.

AB  - The present study aimed to develop a method for testing pain-related behaviour induced by formalin in the Spekeâ€™s hingeback tortoise ( Kinixys spekii ). These animals retract their head and limbs into their shell when approached, making behavioural testing almost impossible. It was found that suspending the animals in the air, facing away from the observer, made the animals keep their limbs out of the shell. Subcutaneous injection of formalin induced easily identifiable and quantifiable behaviours that lasted for 20 minutes. Contrary to the biphasic effect of formalin observed in rats and mice, the response in tortoises was monophasic. The suspended formalin test may be useful for studying nociceptive mechanisms in tortoises, which in turn will be important for a further understanding of the nociceptive system in reptiles as well as in mammals.

AB  - Flexible foraging strategies, such as prey switching, omnivory and food mixing, are key to surviving in a labile and changing environment. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in western Hudson Bay are versatile predators that use all of these strategies as they seasonally exploit resources across trophic levels. Climate warming is reducing availability of their ice habitat, especially in spring when polar bears gain most of their annual fat reserves by consuming seal pups before coming ashore in summer. How polar bears combine these flexible foraging strategies to obtain and utilize terrestrial food will become increasingly important in compensating for energy deficits from lost seal hunting opportunities. We evaluated patterns in the composition of foods in scat to characterize the foraging behaviors that underpin the diet mixing and omnivory observed in polar bears on land in western Hudson Bay. Specifically, we measured diet richness, proportions of plant and animal foods, patterns in co-occurrence of foods, spatial composition and an index of temporal composition. Scats contained between 1 and 6 foods, with an average of 2.11 (SE = 0.04). Most scats (84.9%) contained at least one type of plant, but animals (35.4% of scats) and both plants and animals occurring together (34.4% of scats) were also common. Certain foods, such as Lyme grass seed heads (Leymus arenarius), berries and marine algae, were consumed in relatively higher proportions, sometimes to the exclusion of others, both where and when they occurred most abundantly. The predominance of localized vegetation in scats suggests little movement among habitat types between feeding sessions. Unlike the case for plants, no spatial patterns were found for animal remains, likely due the animals’ more vagile and ubiquitous distribution. Our results suggest that polar bears are foraging opportunistically in a manner consistent with maximizing intake while minimizing energy expenditure associated with movement. The frequent mixing of plant-based carbohydrate and animal-based protein could suggest use of a strategy that other Ursids employ to maximize weight gain. Further, consuming high rates of certain vegetation and land-based animals that may yield immediate energetic gains could, instead, provide other benefits such as fulfilling vitamin/mineral requirements, diluting toxins and assessing new foods for potential switching.

AB  - Fungi are important food for many invertebrates (Moore 1996). They are also widely consumed by small mammals (Fogel & Trappe 1978, Meserve et al. 1988), and may make up more than half of the volume of food in the stomachs of sciurid and microtid rodents in temperate forests (Maser et al. 1978). The use of fungi by vertebrates has not been investigated in the tropics, although macrofungi are common in some tropical systems, such as the miombo woodlands of southern Africa (Hogberg & Piearce 1986). The use of fungi by vertebrates other than small mammals is also little known. This paper describes a quantitative analysis of the diet and food selection of a tropical tortoise reported to feed on fungi. Most terrestrial tortoises (Testudinidae) have a 'predominantly or exclusively herbivorous diet' (Pritchard 1979:247), and feed almost entirely on vascular plants (Hansen et al. 1976, Milton 1992, Rall & Fairall 1993). Nevertheless one group, namely the African hingeback tortoises Kinixys Bell, appears to be omnivorous. All species of Kinixys have been reported to eat fungi and/or invertebrates: K. erosa (Schweigger) and K. homeana Bell from West Africa (Blackwell 1968, Villiers 1958), K. lobatsiana Power and K. natalensis Hewitt from South

AB  - Examination of all the Kinixys Bell material from Southern Africa south of 22Â° S available in museum collections has shown that four species occur in this region. On the basis of its poorly developed plastral hinge and gular lip, K. natalensis Hewitt is considered the most primitive species in the genus. It has a restricted distribution along the eastern escarpment of South Africa from the Transvaal south to Natal. Kinixys spekii Gray seems to be the next most primitive species, but its depressed carapace is an adaptation that enables it to find refuge in rock crevices. It has a very extensive distribution on the central African plateau. Kinixys belliana Gray is a larger species with a more convex carapace and a black radial pattern on the shields. Its distribution is restricted to the coastal plain. Kinixys lobatsiana Power differs from the other savanna species, and resembles the forest species K. erosa (Schweigger) and K. homeana Bell, in having the posterior marginal shields recurved and serrated. Its distribution is limited to the Transvaal Bushveld and southeastern Botswana.
