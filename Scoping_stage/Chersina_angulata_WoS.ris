AB  - A wild-caught Bowsprit tortoise (Chersina angulata) was received into quarantine and appeared clinically normal. Oral swabs for consensus herpesvirus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing were obtained during routine quarantine, and a novel herpesvirus was identified. Comparative sequence analysis shows that this virus is a member of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae in the proposed genus Chelonivirus. Host/virus co-evolution appears to be common amongst herpesviruses and their hosts, and the most significant disease is typically seen when herpesviruses jump to related host species. Previous studies have found some diversity of herpesviruses in tortoises. This report expands the number of known herpesviruses of tortoises. It is reasonable to expect that there will be significantly different clinical consequences of different tortoise herpesviruses in different species, and that identification of host/virus relationships will aid in clinical management of tortoise collections. Further work is needed to determine the clinical implications of this and other tortoise herpesviruses in different tortoise species.

TI  - PREDATION ON THE ANGULATE TORTOISE CHERSINA-ANGULATA BY THE KELP GULL LARUS-DOMINICANUS ON DASSEN ISLAND, WESTERN CAPE
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - AFRICA
AB  - The kelp gull (Larus dominicanus) is an important predator on the angulate tortoise (Chersina angulata) on Dassen Island, Western Cape, South Africa.  Tortoise shell fragments (n = 142) were collected and measured.  Using regression curves based on 184 live tortoises measured on the island, the size class of tortoises eaten by kelp gulls was determined to include tortoises from 38-124 mm (mean 84 mm) total length (mass 25-350 g; mean 130 g).  It is probable that very small tortoises were also eaten, but totally consumed.  It is suggested that predation on tortoises occurs during the autumn-winter by the small population of resident gulls (approximately 50 individuals).

Some of the affected leopard tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis) from this group showed respiratory signs. Samples were collected from one of the ill tortoises, and a Mycoplasma spp. and a herpesvirus were detected by PCR. Sequencing of a portion of the DNA polymerase gene of the herpesvirus showed 99% identity with testudinid herpesvirus 4, previously described only once in a bowsprit tortoise (Chersina angulata) in the United States.

AB  - This paper reports a previously undescribed form of predation upon the angulate tortoise, Chersina angulata, in the West Coast National Park, South Africa. Twelve recently killed C. angulata were found, within an area of 4-5 hectares, during April 2000. The head and neck were missing from all individuals, while the rest of the body was undamaged. Spoor of the large grey mongoose, Herpestes ichneumon, was observed at a freshly killed tortoise and it is argued that this was the predator responsible.

AB  - We examined the activity patterns of angulate tortoises, Chersina angulata, on Dassen Island, South Africa, during spring, summer and winter. During typical spring and summer days, C. angulata exhibited a bimodal pattern of activity, with activity being suspended around midday. However, during winter, and on cool and wet summer days, activity was unimodal, peaking around midday. Temporal patterns of activity appeared strongly influenced by environmental factors, particularly temperature. Chersina angulata were never observed to be active at air temperatures below 14.0degreesC or above 28.7degreesC. Activity levels were lowest during summer, when animals were active only 1.75% of the time. Brief appearances of available water (usually from condensing fog) during summer, however, resulted in a dramatic increase in activity levels. Males were significantly more active than females during summer and spring, but no significant difference was found between the sexes in winter. Results of this study are principally contrasted with those from a study conducted near the easternmost range of C. angulata, an area that experiences a markedly different climate.

Six cases of actual predation and in cases of attempted predation were observed during the 13-month study. Predated tortoises were smaller than those subjected to attempted predation, with both of these groups being smaller than the population mean. Predation by baboons may be an important factor limiting tortoise population sizes at De Hoop Nature Reserve.

AB  - The phylogeographic structure of the monotypic endemic southern African angulate tortoise Chersina angulata was investigated throughout its distribution with the use of partial sequences from three mtDNA loci (COI, cyt b and ND4). Phylogeographic and phylogenetic structuring obtained for the three mtDNA markers were highly congruent and suggested the presence of two genetically distinct, reciprocally monophyletic evolutionary lineages. Group one contained two subclades with haplotypes from the north-western Cape and south-western Cape, respectively, while haplotypes from the southern Cape comprised group two. The two major clades were separated by nine and eight mutational steps for COI and ND4, respectively. Of the three mtDNA gene regions examined, the ND4 partial sequence contained the most phylogenetic signal. Haplotype diversity was generally low and we recovered 34 haplotypes for the 125 animals sequenced for the ND4 subunit. Nested clade analyses performed on the variable ND4 partial sequences suggested the presence of two major refugial areas for this species. The demographic history of the taxon was characterised by range expansion and prolonged historical fragmentation. Divergence time estimates suggest that the temporal and spatial distribution of the taxon was sculpted by changes in temperature and rainfall patterns since the late Miocene. Corroborative evidence from other reptiles is also suggestive of a late Miocene divergence, indicating that this was a major epoch for cladogenesis in southern Africa. Apart from the genetic differences between the two major clades, we also note morphometric and behavioural differences, alluding to the presence of two putative taxa nested within C. angulata.

AB  - We investigated genetic variation within and among three populations of Chersina angulata; two in the southwestern Cape (West Coast National Park and Dassen Island), of South Africa and Kleinzee in the northwestern parts of the species' range. Mitochondrial DNA sequences (274 base pairs) of the cytocbrome bgene of 25 C. angulata identified 10 haplotypes in three lineages. Estimates of coalescence time for the three lineages ranged from approximately 1.3 to 3.8 million years, implying that the lineages' present distribution may reflect radiation during the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene Epochs. The mtDNA sequences of Dassen island and West Coast National Park populations did not differ significantly. The geographic heterogeneity in haplotype frequency distribution suggests that the Kleinzee population represents a distinct lineage from the two southwestern populations. The observed genetic structure of C. angulata has management implications for the conservation of this species. Until more information is available, we recommend that C. angulata should not be translocated between the northwestern and southwestern regions, to prevent disruption of local gene pools.

AB  - The angulate tortoise Chersina angulata is unique among South African tortoises in having a single unpaired gular (extension of the ventral plastron) that is used to ram and overturn rival conspecifics. This behaviour has earned it the reputation of a 'fighting tortoise', and in this paper we test the hypothesis that the morphology of this tortoise is a result of intrasexual selection. Research was carried out on the tortoise population of Dassen Island in September 2004. Tortoises were captured and processed (body mass and five morphological measurements) in situ in the field. A total of 144 males and 99 females were sampled. Males were significantly larger than females for all body parameters measured. Males had significantly longer gulars (F=17.783, P < 0.005, n=242) and greater posterior carapace width (F=143.664, P < 0.005, n=242) relative to body size than females. A total of 66 male-male interactions was observed in the field. Males that won fights were significantly longer than males that lost fights (t=2.238, P < 0.034, n=28) and had significantly greater rear carapace width relative to middle carapace width (F=5.591, P=0.026, n=28). Gular length was found to be irrelevant to fighting success. Tortoises of both sexes were placed upside down to compare righting ability. Males were significantly more successful at righting themselves than females (chi(2)=5.347, P=0.0208, n=70). It was concluded that posterior carapace width is a more important variable than gular length in determining male fighting success, and it is suggested that, in addition to righting ability, posterior carapace width may well be a trait under sexual selection in male angulate tortoises.

AB  - Chelonian intranuclear coccidiosis has been reported once, in two radiated tortoises (Geochelone radiata), and is apparently rare. We describe intranuclear coccidiosis diagnosed histologically in two radiated tortoises, three Travancore tortoises (Indotestudo forstenii), two leopard tortoises (Geochelone pardalis), one bowsprit tortoise (Chersina angulata), and one impressed tortoise (Manouria impressa). Infection was systemic and involved alimentary, urogenital, respiratory, lymphoid, endocrine, and integumentary systems. Trophozoites, meronts, merozoites, macrogametocytes, microgametocytes, and nonsporulated oocysts were seen histologically or by electron microscopy. Intracytoplasmic and extracellular stages of parasite development also were identified histologically. Sequencing of a coccidial 18S rRNA consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product revealed a novel sequence that provided phylogenetic information and may be useful for further diagnostic test design. Intranuclear coccidiosis was associated with variable degrees of inflammation in all cases, was considered the cause of death in six tortoises, and was a substantial contributing factor to the cause of death in two tortoises.

AB  - Fifty-two tortoises, comprising 50 leopard tortoises Geochelone pardalis, one angulate tortoise Chersina angulata and one marsh terrapin Pelomedusa subrufa were found dead along 8,4 km of electrified fences in the Thomas Baines Nature Reserve, eastern Cape Province. Sixteen of these mortalities occurred during a 132-day  study period. Assuming reduced tortoise activity in winter, a conservative mortality rate of about 30 tortoises per year is estimated along the electrified fence in the reserve. Using regression curves based on detailed measurements of 109 leopard tortoises, the total length and shell height of 42 of the electrocuted animals  were calculated from their plastron lengths. Most tortoises (93%) killed were young adults (200-400 mm   total length). The height of the electrified wire measured at the point of electrocution of 30 dead tortoises was, with one exception, less than 200 mm above ground level. To reduce tortoise mortality in the reserve it is recommended that the electrified wire height be maintained at at least 250 mm above ground level, and that the fences be powered only at night.

More time is required to achieve eggshell calcification from July to October than from March to June. In most instances (71%) females lay their eggs when the eggshell still appears relatively thin on the radiographs, with only few eggs becoming more prominently calcified prior to oviposition.

AB  - Tortoises are one of the most common faunal components at many Palaeolithic archaeological sites across the Old World. They provide protein, fat, and other 'animal' resources in a 'collectable' package. However, for most sites their interpretation as human food debris is based only on association, rather than demonstrated through taphonomic analysis. Because of their very different anatomical configuration compared to mammals, it is difficult to conduct such analyses by directly applying the taphonomic methods used to interpret large mammal assemblages. Tortoise-specific taphonomic analysis is presented here for the Still Bay layers at the important Middle Stone Age (MSA) site of Blombos Cave (BBC), Western Cape; South Africa. Research on MSA subsistence systems at sites such as BBC has almost exclusively relied on analysis of large ungulate remains, in spite of the fact that many of these key sites contain equal or greater numbers of tortoise fragments. In this analysis we show that human modification is common on the BBC tortoises, and that there are consistent patterns of fragmentation and burning that indicate set processing sequences including cooking while in the shell, hammerstone percussion, and human chewing of limbs. The almost exclusive dominance of the angulate tortoise, Chersina angulata, is confirmed by full skeletal element analyses rather than only counts of single elements such as humeri. The sex distribution can be reconstructed for this species, and is female-biased. For all tortoise assemblages, taxonomic and skeletal element abundance data should be calculated from a sample of complete elements, or at minimum the entoplastron and humerus. A sample of shell and limb/girdle elements should also be subjected to microscopic bone surface modification analysis, as modifications are often rare or subtle but highly informative. Using this approach, analysis of breakage patterns, bone surface modification, and burning patterns can be understood together to specifically reconstruct tortoise collection, processing, and human dietary significance across a range of archaeological sites.

AB  - We investigated bone mineral density values of the shell (carapace and plastron) of a modern leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys purdahs Bell, 1828) to assess its impact on survivorship of the different skeletal elements. We found significant differences among elements for bone mineral density and density volume, but not for bone mineral content.
   We then compared these findings with those obtained using computed tomography (CT) scans of shells of three modern tortoise species that differ in size and shape; the leopard tortoise, greater padloper (Homopus femoralis) and angulate tortoise (Chersina angulata). Results indicate that the patterning of bone density is similar across shell elements and scan sites in all species, although all values were lower in the greater padloper, which we attributed to shape differences - a flat rather than domed shell.
   Finally, we correlated the frequency of shell elements from the Holocene leopard tortoises recovered at the site of Wonderwerk Cave (South Africa) using, as a proxy, the densitometry values obtained from the modern leopard tortoise. For most strata there was a significant association with skeletal element survivorship demonstrating the role played by bone mineral density in determining the skeletal composition of this assemblage.

KW  - TURTLE
AB  - The reproductive cycle and egg production of Chersina angulata females, maintained under natural climate conditions, were studied over 29 months using ultrasonography. Angulate tortoises initiated egg production in February (late summer) and were gravid through most of the year. A short nongravid period in January indicates a cyclic rather than continuous reproductive pattern. Chersina angulata females produced one egg at a time, and clutch frequency ranged from one to six per year. Annual fecundity was influenced by the date of reproductive onset and egg-retention time; early ovulation and a short retention time increased annual fecundity. Egg retention time was highly variable (23-212 days) and correlated to ambient temperature (inversely) and rainfall (positively). Temperature had no direct effect on oviposition, but rainfall served as an important exogenous cue, perhaps facilitating nesting. Oviposition and ovulation were synchronized and females prepared a new egg immediately after oviposition. This reproductive pattern is highly unusual for chelonians in Mediterranean climates. This pattern might facilitate reproduction in the different environments over the range of C. angulata.

AB  - We do not know whether the availability of food plants is the primary factor enabling Angulate Tortoises to inhabit a wide variety of habitats along the southern and western coasts of South Africa. Here we used focal observations to study the diet of Angulate Tortoises over four seasons at two distinct sites in the southwestern Cape, the West Coast National Park (WCNP), and Dassen Island (DI). Seasonal fluctuations in temperature, rainfall, and food plant availability influenced the activity pattern and feeding activity of Angulate Tortoises. Tortoises were more active during the wet season, winter and spring, than during the dry season, summer and autumn. Diet differed between sites and among seasons. WCNP tortoises had a diverse diet of grasses, shrubs, herbs, and succulents, whereas DI tortoises ate mostly herbaceous plants. DI tortoises had few dietary choices available compared to choices available to WCNP tortoises. At both sites, herbs and seedlings were important diet components during the wet season. The dry season diet consisted largely of dry plant material. Angulate Tortoises on DI supplemented their intake of dry plant material with rabbit feces, which comprised more than 27% of the diet in summer and autumn. The opportunistic feeding behavior of Angulate Tortoises helps explain their distribution among a wide variety of habitats. Their persistence in disturbed areas is probably determined by the abundance of easily digestible, herbaceous plants during the wet season and the tortoises' low activity and low metabolic demands during unfavorable periods.

AB  - Using range-wide sampling and 1,143 bp of mtDNA (cytochrome b gene) and 14 microsatellite loci, we examined genetic differentiation in the widely distributed Southern African angulate tortoise (Chersina angulata). We found evidence for two genealogical lineages that differ in both genetic marker systems and their preferred habitat conditions. According to a fossil-calibrated molecular clock for all African tortoise lineages using 1,870 bp mitochondrial and 1,416 bp nuclear DNA, the two lineages of C. angulata diverged in the Pliocene (approx. 3.8 million years ago). Species distribution models reveal that the ranges of the two lineages shifted little since the Last Glacial Maximum, which is in agreement with the demographic population descriptors suggestive of stationary populations that did not experience expansion. One lineage occurs in the west, and the other in the south of the extant distribution range. In the geographic contact zone, the two lineages hybridize extensively, providing evidence for their conspecificity under the biological species concept. Each lineage could be recognized as a distinct subspecies, but the ill-defined geographic origins of the type material of the available names prevent their identification with any taxon. With respect to the nuclear genomic markers, the western lineage shows further north-south substructuring. A few genetically mismatched tortoises are interpreted as human translocations. Our study underlines that confiscated or captive angulate tortoises of unknown geographic provenance should not be released without prior genetic screening to avoid genetic pollution of wild populations.

AB  - Behavioural frequencies and time budgets for male and female Chersina angulata were recorded in spring, September 2004. The daily activity of the population was 10.51 +/- 0.42 h (mean Q, but individual males and females were in the open for 2.57 +/- 1.12 h and 1.58 +/- 1.44 h, respectively. Both sexes spent nearly 3.5 h per day basking with 90% of the basking time in the cover of sparse vegetation. Feeding and walking were the most frequent active behaviours. The activity pattern of the sexes differed between 10:00 and 12:00 in the morning when males spent more time out of cover on active behaviours, particularly feeding, than females did. The daily activity pattern of the population peaked between 10:00 and 12:00, reflecting the activity pattern of the more active sex, males. Females were out of cover, active, and feeding at higher temperatures than were males. The high temperatures probably allowed females to complete activities more efficiently, reducing their exposure time and predation risk. Although fighting and mating represented small fractions of male time budgets, the extended physical presence through walking and feeding may help males to establish dominance hierarchies and enhance mating success.

AB  - The objective of the study was to record the tick species collected from three species of tortoise, each in a different province of South Africa. Ticks were collected from leopard tortoises, Stigmochyles pardalis, in the southern region of the Kruger National Park, Mpumalanga province; from hingeback tortoises, Kinixys zombensis, in the Enseleni Nature Reserve, KwaZulu-Natal province and from angulate tortoises, Chersina angulata, in the West Coast National Park, Western Cape province. Of the 63 leopard tortoises examined, 58 were infested with Amblyomma marmoreum and 49 with Amblyomma hebraeum, and all stages of development of both species were recovered. Amblyomma nuttalli was collected from 25 hingeback tortoises, and all stages of development were present. All 24 angulate tortoises examined were infested with Amblyomma sylvaticum, and large numbers of larvae, nymphs and adults were collected. Three snake species and a sand lizard were also infested with A. sylvaticum. The adults of A. marmoreum, A. nuttalli and A. sylvaticum were identified as specific parasites of the family Testudinidae, whereas all stages of development of A. hebraeum were classified as generalists.

AB  - Fencing, including electric fencing, is widely used across South Africa for livestock and game ranching practices. Leopard tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis) are particularly prone to being killed by electric fences, but no published studies have assessed the impact of fence structure or quantified tortoise mortality along non-electric fences. This is a conservation concern, especially because South Africa is home to more tortoise species than any other country. This study relates tortoise mortality associated with electrified and non-electrified fences to fence structure, and uses transects away from fences as a comparison to estimate the impact of fences on mortality. All fence types had significantly higher tortoise mortality than open veld transects. Leopard tortoise mortalities were greatest along electric fences (56 % of mortalities), even though these comprised only 4% of fences in the study. By comparison, most angulate tortoises (Chersina angulata) died after becoming wedged in mesh fences. The distribution and abundance of fence types along 2200 km of roads was used to extrapolate the impacts of different fence types on tortoises in the southeastern Karoo, South Africa. A survey of land-use types indicated that game farms were more likely to be associated with the presence of electric fences. Regulations are needed to limit mortality of vulnerable species (tortoises, pangolins) on electric fences by setting a minimum strand height and 'escape' periods implemented through randomized off times or thermostatic switches.

AB  - The current study deduced the growth pattern and lifestyle habits of Chersina angulata based on bone histology and cross-sectional geometry of limb bones. Femora, humeri, and tibiae of seven different-sized individuals representing different ontogenetic stages were assessed to determine the interelement and intraskeletal histological variation within and among the tortoises. The bone histology of adult propodials consists of a highly vascularized, uninterrupted fibrolamellar bone tissue with a woven texture in the perimedullary and midcortical regions suggesting overall fast early growth. However, later in ontogeny, growth was slow and even ceased periodically as suggested by slowly formed parallel-fibered bone tissue and several growth marks in the pericortical region. In juvenile individuals, fibrolamellar bone tissue is restricted to the perimedullary regions of propodials as remnants of bone formed during the earliest stages of ontogeny. The epipodials are characterized by having parallel-fibered bone tissue present in their cortices; however, periodic arrests in growth are recorded at various times. Remnants of fibrolamellar bone tissue formed during early ontogeny occur in the epipodials of only a few individuals. Interelement variation is evident, in terms of variation in the orientation of vascular canals between individuals and within the same diaphyseal cross-sections. Different elements show varying cross-sectional geometry, which appear to be correlated with the fossorial behavior of the species. Our results show that of all the long bones, the tibia is least remodeled during ontogeny and it is therefore the best element for skeletochronology.

AB  - In a captive colony of Chersina angulata in Cape Town, South Africa, we observed in 2015/16 retention of the last egg clutch inside the female until the hatching stage was reached, conforming to the generally accepted definition of viviparity. Retrospective climatic analysis indicates egg retention until the hatching stage co-occurred with unusually hot summer weather: the average air temperatures in December 2015 and January and February 2016 were higher than during the preceding five and the following 5 years when facultative viviparity could not be observed. Late December and January appears to be the critical period for females to either deposit their last clutch of the nesting season into a nest, or to retain the last clutch for embryonic development inside the female. Over the 28 December to 24 January period the minimum, average and maximum air temperatures in 2015-16 were about 3 degrees C higher than in the five following years. This association of facultative viviparity with unusual summer heat suggests that hot ambient temperatures at the end of the nesting season may cue females to switch from oviposition to facultative viviparity. Compared to incubation in a nest this phenotypic plasticity of the reproductive mode-to retain during hot summers the season's last clutch inside the female-may buffer the developing embryos from excessive heat exposure: females can thermo-regulate by moving among microhabitats whereas sun exposed shallow nests cannot escape high ground temperatures. This novel reproductive strategy has the potential to enhance the resilience of species to global warming.

AB  - Blood films were examined from 154 wild and captive tortoises from four provinces of South Africa, including Gauteng, Kwazulu-Natal, North West and Western Cape. The five species of chelonians studied were Chersina angulata (Schweigger), Kinixys belliana belliana (Gray), K. lobatsiana Power, K. natalensis Hewitt, and Stigmochelys pardalis (Bell). Two species of haemogregarines, previously reported from Mozambique, were identified in blood films, namely Haemogregarina fitzsimonsi Dias, 1953 and Haemogregarina parvula Dias, 1953. Additional stages of development (trophozoites and probable meronts, merozoites and immature gamonts) in blood preparations from South Africa warranted the redescription of H. fitzsimonsi. A variety of hosts and broad host distribution range were observed for this haemogregarine, with all five species of tortoises parasitized, wild and captive, from all four provinces, in all seasons. In contrast, only two individuals of K. b. belliana and one S. pardalis, all three captive in Kwazulu-Natal, contained H. parvula with encapsulated stages resembling those of Hemolivia mauritanica (Sergent et Sergent, 1904). For H. fitzsimonsi, parasite prevalences, but not parasitaemias, were significantly higher in captive than wild S. pardalis; captive female S. pardalis also showed a significantly greater prevalence of infection than males, but younger, lighter hosts were not significantly more heavily parasitized than older, heavier individuals. The ticks, Amblyomma marmoreum Koch, 1844 and A. sylvaticum (De Geer, 1778), found attached to some tortoises, may prove to be definitive hosts for the two species of haemogregarines observed.

KW  - HISTORY
AB  - Chersina angulata females ovulate sequentially and oviposit multiple, mostly single egg clutches from early autumn (March) throughout winter and spring until early summer (December). No matter when eggs are laid, they usually hatch in autumn (March/April). Evidence based on circumstantial observations also demonstrates that wild and captive females occasionally retain the last clutch of the season until completion of embryonic development in autumn, conforming to the accepted definition of viviparity in reptiles. However, developmental progress throughout the year and embryonic stages of freshly deposited last clutches has not yet been reported. We candled all eggs laid from April to December in a captive colony of C. angulata in an outdoor enclosure in Cape Town, South Africa, to estimate developmental progress and embryonic stages. In all eggs laid during autumn, winter, and early spring (March to mid-October), vitelline blood vessels, indicating development had progressed to somite formation, only started to become visible at approximately the same time in late November. Until mid-spring, embryonic development of those eggs had been arrested prior to somite formation; the embryos underwent diapause until, presumably, increasing temperatures reinitiated development. Development then progressed throughout summer until the hatching stage was reached in early autumn. However, eggs laid in late spring (mid-October to November) skipped diapause, and embryonic development progressed without interruption, demonstrating that, depending on the season of oviposition, diapause in C. angulata is facultative. Candling of an egg laid in late December showed that, prior to oviposition, embryonic development inside the female had already advanced to an embryonic stage with well-developed vitelline circulation corresponding to Yntema stage 12. Contrary to the generally accepted wisdom that intrauterine embryonic development in the order Testudines is always arrested at the gastrula stage, embryonic development inside the female had already reached the stage of somite formation. This phenotypic plasticity in the expression or abolishment of preovipositional developmental arrest represents a transitional stage in the evolution towards viviparity.

AB  - The site of Blombos Cave (BBC), Western Cape, South Africa has been a strong contributor to establishing the antiquity of important aspects of modern human behaviour, such as early symbolism and technological complexity. However, many linkages between Middle Stone Age (MSA) behaviour and the subsistence record remain to be investigated. Understanding the contribution of small fauna such as tortoises to the human diet is necessary for identifying shifts in overall foraging strategies as well as the collecting and processing behaviour of individuals unable to participate in large-game hunting. This study uses published data to estimate the number of calories present in tortoises as well as ungulates of different body size classes common at South African sites. A single tortoise (Chersina angulata) provides approximately 3332 kJ (796 kcal) of calories in its edible tissues, which is between 20 and 30% of the daily energetic requirements for an active adult (estimated between 9360 kJ [3327 kcal] and 14,580 kJ [3485 kcal] per day). Because they are easy to process, this would have made tortoises a highly-ranked resource, but their slow growth and reproduction makes them susceptible to over-exploitation. Zooarchaeological abundance data show that during the ca. 75 ka (thousands of years) upper Still Bay M1 phase at BBC, tortoises contributed twice as many calories to the diet relative to ungulates than they did during the ca. 100 ka lower M3 phase. However, in spite of the abundance of their fossils, their absolute caloric contribution relative to ungulates remained modest in both phases. At the end of the site's M5A occupation history, human subsistence strategies shifted to emphasise high-return large hunted mammals, which likely precipitated changes in the social roles of hunters and gatherers during the Still Bay.

FX  - JCT is indebted to Sven Ouzman and Petro Keene at the Iziko South African Museum in Cape Town for facilitating access to the Blombos tortoise collection. Wilhelmina Seconna kindly provided daily access to the archaeological collections and Denise Hamerton provided access to the tortoise comparative material, as well as laboratory space for measuring modern tortoises. Guy Thomas was an invaluable lab assistant, and very good at refitting tortoises. Simon van Noort provided access to the microscope used to take the photographs of surface modification. The tortoise research was funded by a University of Queensland postdoctoral research fellowship. Large mammal data were collected with the aid of National Science Foundation (NSF) Dissertation Improvement Grant number 0620317, an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, a Fulbright Fellowship to South Africa, and funding from the School of Human Evolution and Social Change at Arizona State University. Access to the mammalian assemblage was facilitated by Graham Avery and Royden Yates in the initial stages of research, and later by Sarah Wurz. Royden Yates must also be thanked for his initial idea that "tortoises were the McDonald's of the MSA". Financial support was provided to CSH by a European Research Council Advanced Grant, TRACSYMBOLS No. 249587, awarded under the FP7 programme at the University of Bergen, Norway, and by a National Research Foundation/Department of Science and Technology funded Chair at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa. Andrew Ugan, two anonymous reviewers, Mark Teaford, and an Associate Editor of this journal provided much helpful advice for improving the original submission.

AB  - The NRF/Royal Society Science Engineering and Technology programme in Zoology at the University of the Western Cape, entitled 'Southern African and sub-Saharan African Biodiversity', was initiated in 1996. Following the Convention on Biological Biodiversity, biodiversity was defined as 'the variability among living organisms from all sources, including terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems'. The programme was built around four research projects that primarily reflected the interests and expertise of staff, though national interest, natural features and geographic location were also criteria. The main objectives of these projects and some key results are highlighted below, followed by an evaluation of the programme in terms of the original goals.

AB  - Terrestrial tortoises, Chersina angulata (Schweigger, 1812), Kinixys belliana belliana Gray, 1831, K. Iobatsiana Power, 1927, K natalensis Hewitt, 1935, and Stigmochelys purdalis (Bell, 1828), both wild (n = 84) and captive (n = 70), were examined for hematozoans from the provinces of Gauteng, Kwazulu-Natal, North West, and Western Cape, South Africa. In Giemsa-stained blood films, 2 species of hemoproteids were identified, I previously described, that is, Haemoproteus testudinalis (Laveran, 1905) Wenyon, 1915, the other unknown. Haemoproteus testudinalis occurred in 2/27 wild K. lobatskina and 1/41 S. pardalis and 2/2 captive K. lobatsiana from the North West and Gauteng, respectively, whereas Haemoproteus sp. A was recorded in 1 of 3 captive K. natalensis from Kwazulu-Natal. Haemoproteus testudinalis had pale blue-stained, often vacuolated, halteridial macrogametocytes, pale pink-stained microhalterdial to halteridial mierogametocytes, and dark, scattered, often bacillus-like hemozoin granules. Haemoproteus natalensis n. sp. had ameboid growth stages, blue-stained halteridial to circumnuclear macrogametocytes, purple-stained circumnuclear microgametocytes, and brownish, often clustered, pigment granules. It is recommended that Haemoproteus balazuci Dias, 1953, become a junior synonym of H. testudinalis.

AB  - Herbivorous tortoises in arid, winter-rainfall regions need to forage in seasons that provide relatively little heat for their ectothermic metabolism. To help understand how tortoises exploit resources in winter-rainfall areas, I recorded ambient, soil, and body temperatures for Homopus signatus in four spring seasons, and in one summer, autumn, and winter. The spring thermal environment enabled H. signatus to maintain body temperatures that were high compared to other small tortoise species. Mature females had higher spring body temperatures than males and immature individuals, probably because mature females were developing eggs. In summer, autumn, and winter, body temperatures differed between males and females, relating to sexually different activities and retreat uses. The relatively high body temperatures of H. signatus in winter and spring, along with a non-isometric relationship between body temperature and soil temperature, suggest that tortoises thermoregulated and may need considerable time to gain heat. Additional studies should compare body temperatures of H. signatus to operative temperatures, and determine the vulnerability of the taxon to human interferences that affect behavioural time budgets and body temperatures.

AB  - Angulate tortoises (Chersina angulata) were probably introduced onto Dassen Island, South Africa, at the beginning of this century. Historical records indicate distance from the mainland appears to prevent emigration from, or immigration to, this island population. We estimated population size and density using a mark-recapture method, and determined sex ratio and population structure in 1978 and again in 1989. These figures were compared with published values for a mainland population. Population sizes and sex ratios did not differ significantly between 1978 and 1989: density was 31.2/ha and 34.2/ha, and sex ratios were 1:1.18 and 1:1.17 in favor of males, respectively. In both years the population showed a preponderance of adults. However, mean and maximum adult body size was greater in 1989. The island population was similar to the mainland population in terms of sex ratio and density, but differed in that there were proportionately more large males and females on the island. Factors that might cause an increase in size of island tortoises include predation on different sized tortoises by mainland compared with island predators. Reduced competition on the island and the potential effects of isolation may also affect body size. We suggest that the limits to the size of the island tortoise population will be primarily determined by numbers of breeding penguins and rabbits, whose activities remove vegetation used by tortoises for food and cover.

AB  - Understanding variation in vegetation communities is integral to characterizing resource requirements of herbivores over their range. We evaluated seasonal environmental effects on the plant composition of two contrasting angulate, tortoise habitats in the southwestern Cape. Plant cover, species diversity and the variety of growth forms were substantially greater at the West Coast National Park (WP) than on Dassen Island (BI). Although shrubs and grasses were dominant growth forms at the WP, herbs, succulents, restios, sedges and parasitic plants contributed 30% of the cover. Most species had low relative cover indices, and a few perennial species provided most of the cover. On the island, succulents and herbs were the only growth forms, and ephemeral plants contributed more than perennials did to plant cover throughout the year. Seasonal fluctuations in plant cover, species richness and diversity on DI were larger than in the WP, despite the island experiencing higher annual rainfall and milder temperatures. The perennial flora in the WP provided greater stability with smaller responses to high summer aridity and large temperature fluctuations. Although the WP supports a greater variety of herbivores, the island has a higher density of angulate tortoises, showing this species' adaptability to a depauperate flora.

AB  - A total of 586 reptiles, belonging to 35 species and five subspecies, were examined in surveys aimed at determining the species spectrum and geographic distribution of ticks that infest them. Of these reptiles 509 were tortoises, 28 monitor or other lizards, and 49 snakes. Nine ixodid tick species, of which seven belonged to the genus Amblyomma, and one argasid tick, Ornithodoros compactus were recovered. Seven of the ten tick species are parasites of reptiles. Amongst these seven species Amblyomma marmoreum was most prevalent and numerous on leopard tortoises, Geochelone pardalis; Amblyomma nuttalli was present only on Bell's hinged tortoises, Kinixys belliana; and most Amblyomma sylvaticum were collected from angulate tortoises, Chersina angulata. Amblyomma exornatum (formerly Aponomma exornatum) was only recovered from monitor lizards, Varanus spp.; most Amblyomma latum (formerly Aponomma latum) were from snakes; and a single nymph of Amblyomma transversale (formerly Aponomma transversale) was collected from a southern African python, Python natalensis. All 30 Namaqualand speckled padloper tortoises, Homopus signatus signatus, examined were infested with O. compactus.
   The seasonal occurrence of A. sylvaticum and the geographic distribution of this tick and of A. marmoreum, A. nuttalli, A. exornatum, A. latum and O. compactus, are illustrated.

AB  - The population parameters (morphometrics, population size and biomass) were determined for leopard and angulate tortoises in the Thicket Biome, Eastern Cape, South Africa. Leopard tortoises had a mean total length of 306.47 mm (SD = 94.65 mm, range 59-496 mm, n = 89). Males were smaller (mean total length = 277.31 mm, SD = 71.85 mm, range 73-377 mm, n = 36) than females (mean total length = 332.33 mm, SD = 97.64 mm, range 59-496 mm, n = 53). Angulate tortoises had a mean total length of 155.17 mm (SD = 33.89 mm, range 59-194 mm, n = 18). Males were larger (mean total length = 186 mm, SD = 8.40 mm, range 174-194 mm, n = 5) than females (mean total length = 143.31 mm, SD = 32.48 mm, range 59-178 mm, n = 13). The estimated population density for leopard tortoises was 0.85 tortoises ha(-1) with an estimated biomass of 6.02 kg ha(-1). Angulate tortoise population density was estimated at 0.12 tortoises ha(-1) with a mean biomass of 0.06 kg ha(-1). The possible consequences of this high density and biomass are discussed.

AB  - Ultrasonography is a powerful new tool in reproductive physiology and ecology but quantitative evaluations of acoustic window efficacies are necessary to assess methodological accuracy. We evaluated the efficacy of the left inguinal, right inguinal and cranial acoustic windows for detecting ovarian follicles and oviducal eggs in three tortoise species. Incorporating cranial results improved upon inguinal efficacies for detecting follicles in the three species, and for detecting eggs in Chersina angulata, which had small inguinal apertures for its body size. The cranial window provided the best follicle results (highest numbers detected) but the left inguinal window provided the best egg results. This asymmetry was probably due to the primarily posterior position of the oviducts (eggs) and the pliable ovarian sheets allowing follicles to move cranially. The left-right asymmetry may result from intestinal asymmetry (i.e., between the cecum and descending colon) in obscuring ultrasound transmission or displacing follicles and eggs. Seasonal influences upon efficacies varied with species, partially due to species differences in a) reproductive cycles and b) size and number of follicles and eggs. We attributed other efficacy differences among species to differences in body size and shell morphology, especially the inguinal apertures. Correlation analyses revealed strong individual influences upon window efficacy, suggesting that individuals varied in the position of follicles and eggs and the degree of obfuscation by nonreproductive structures. The paucity of correlations between efficacies and body size reflects the complex interactions of body size, shell morphology, reproductive structures and reproductive cycles on efficacies.

AB  - Phylogeographic patterns in wide-ranging species in southern Africa remain largely unexplored, especially in areas north of South Africa. Here, we investigate population structuring, demographic history, and the colonization pattern of the western rock skink (Trachylepis sulcata), a rock-dwelling species with a range extending from southwestern South Africa into Angola. Using 1056 bp from the mitochondrial marker ND2 and > 2.5 kb from three nuclear genes (EXPH5, KIF24, RAG-1), we constructed allele networks, generated extended Bayesian skyline plots and performed population clustering analyses. Analyses of historical demographic patterns show an overall southward range expansion from Northern Namibia into Southern Namibia and South Africa, although we find contrasting genetic breaks across these geographic regions using nuclear and mitochondrial data. We suggest that mtDNA has introgressed across a nuclear break corresponding to the Knersvlakte region of South Africa, a previously proposed biogeographic barrier for rupicolous species. This pattern of mitochondrial variation contrasts sharply to that of other South African taxa previously investigated, which all show significant mtDNA differentiation across the Knersvlakte region. Additionally, while other taxa show divergences dating to the Pliocene, T. sulcata appears to be a recent arrival in southern Africa, having crossed this barrier and colonized South Africa in the mid-Pleistocene. The complex phylogeographic history of T. sulcata corroborates the intricate patterns of genetic variation found in South African taxa and provides novel insight into historical processes affecting species distributed across Namibia.

AB  - In arid regions with summer rainfall, herbivorous reptiles are able to acquire water and fresh food in the presence of high environmental temperatures that can promote ectotherm activity. However, extremely high temperatures and below average rainfall may also limit foraging opportunities due to risks of overheating and predation while gathering scarce food. Karoo Dwarf Tortoises (Chersobius boulengeri) inhabit an arid region in South Africa where most rains fall around austral summer (October-May). We used focal-animal observations and instantaneous recording to assess their behavioral patterns. Despite relatively high rainfall and available plant growth, Karoo Dwarf Tortoises spent approximately 80-90% of their time in retreats. Whereas activity (behavior outside retreats) in the spring was unrelated to time of the day, possibly due to moderate ambient temperatures, activity in the summer was restricted to the afternoon and evening, when tortoises walked and scanned for food and retreats, and fed only 11 min/d on average. In summer, body temperature of tortoises within retreats was positively associated with retreat temperatures, but tortoises appeared to thermoregulate using bodily postures and possibly other means. We suggest that Karoo Dwarf Tortoises mitigate predation risks by maintaining a low level of activity and thermoregulating within retreats. The short feeding time of Karoo Dwarf Tortoises compared to other tortoise taxa may result in slow growth and reproductive rates, which might in turn affect population resilience and conservation needs of this endangered species.

AB  - To help assess habitat requirements of Critically Endangered geometric tortoises, we used thread-trailing to measure daily activity, movements and refugia of adult Psammobates geometricus in autumn and spring 2002. We found strong differences between seasons, and effects of weather, individuals and sex. The high activity was consistent with mild weather during autumn and spring. However, daily temperatures limited female movements on cool autumn days and male movements on warm spring days, a pattern consistent with sexual size dimorphism (large females and small males). The long movements in autumn probably helped tortoises find food plants that grow quickly after autumn rains; both sexes recover body condition from autumn lows, and females begin egg production in late-autumn and winter. These movements may also help males mate with females before they ovulate. The high activity of females in spring should help them forage and sustain their vitellogenesis, egg production and nesting in spring. Male paths tended to be more linear than female paths in both seasons, so this sexual difference is likely not linked to food consumption. Males may move long, linear paths to engage females and avoid other males. Males may have been thermally-challenged in spring. Their movements decreased with increased ground temperatures (in the sun), they used denser refugia in spring than in autumn, and in spring used denser refugia than females used. Geometric tortoises typically used different refugia on consecutive nights, a type of predator avoidance mechanism.

AB  - The leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis) is the largest of southern Africa's 13 tortoise species, and occurs in a variety of habitats from arid and semi-arid areas to mesic grassveld, savanna and bushveld. Seasonal activity patterns of S. pardalis were investigated as a function of rainfall, sex, time of day, temperature and time after sunrise on farmland in the semi-arid Nama-Karoo, South Africa. We predicted that because of seasonal rainfall, and subsequent increase in the food available, activity patterns of leopard tortoises would vary greatly among seasons, but that the primary constraint on activity levels within a season would be ambient temperature. Type of activity, time of day that the activity was performed, and the frequency that each activity was performed, differed among seasons. There was no overall seasonal difference in the level of activity with sex, but in certain seasons and with regard to specific activities, there were significant differences between the sexes. Diel activity was primarily bimodal in summer and autumn, and unimodal in winter and spring, with non-thermoregulatory activities being performed primarily in the afternoon. There was a positive correlation between number of tortoises caught and rainfall per season, but activity levels and number of tortoises walking and feeding was not correlated with seasonal rainfall. Leopard tortoise activity behaviours responded to ambient temperature, but results indicate that activity is also initiated by the time since sunrise.

AB  - Since 1957, all padlopers were considered Homopus, which was an anomaly, because only two species have four claws on the front and hind limbs. The revival of the genus Chersobius for the five-toed species (signatus, boulengeri and solus) now limits Homopus to the four-toed species (areolatus and femoralis). Molecular data indicate that Homopus is paraphyletic with two well-supported clades: the four-toed Homopus in one clade and the five-toed Chersobius together with Chersina angulata in a second clade. There are numerous distinct morphological and ecological differences between the genera. All Chersobius species have a single, large inguinal scute, whereas the number is variable in Homopus. The midline pectoral scute of Chersobius is consistently longer, and the nuchal scute shorter, than in Homopus. The fourth to fifth vertebral suture is narrow in Homopus and broad in Chersobius. Forelimb scales also differ with 3-4 large rows and 5-6 smaller rows, respectively, in Homopus and Chersobius. Chersobius males have a plastral concavity and Homopus males not. Two Chersobius species (C. signatus and C. boulengeri) are distinguishable from Homopus by having 12 or more marginal scutes, whereas Homopus species have 11 or fewer. The glans penes are respectively V-shaped and heart-shaped in Homopus and Chersobius. Ecological differences include that Chersobius species are rupicolous and inhabit arid regions, whereas Homopus species inhabit more mesic habitats. Homopus females produce multi-egg clutches and tend to be bigger compared to single-egg clutching Chersobius females. Females of all species are larger than conspecific males, and all males have larger shell openings than females have.ZooBankurn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub: 18229454-6662-46F3-8B15-836BF2AC38EB

AB  - Elands Bay Cave has provided abundant large mammal and angulate tortoise bones from three Later Stone Age occupational pulses, bracketed by radiocarbon between 13 600 and 7800 b. p., 4300 and 3100 b. p., and 1800 and 300 b. p. (the radiocarbon ages here and below are uncalibrated). The mammal bones come from thirty-four species as large or larger than the Cape dune molerat. Fur seals, steenbok/ grysbok, and molerat dominate heavily. Other species occur mainly as traces, especially in deposits postdating 9600 b. p. Fur seal bones appear first in layers dated to about 11 000 b. p., where together with intertidal shells, they record the post-glacial rise in sea level that brought the coastline to approximately its current position about 1400 years later. The terrestrial mammals record a change from moister, grassier surroundings before about 9600 b. p. to drier, scrubbier ones afterwards. Deposits dated between 12 000 and 10 000 b. p. document the youngest known occurrence of the large, extinct Cape zebra. Median tortoise size suggests that local human collectors were most numerous about 10 000 b. p., coincident with the time when the density of occupational debris implies especially intensive human use of the cave. Average fur seal age suggests people were present mainly in the August-October interval when dead or exhausted 9-11 month old seals would have been especially abundant on the nearby shore.
