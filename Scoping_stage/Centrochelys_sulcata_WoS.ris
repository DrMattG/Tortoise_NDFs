AB  - An African spurred tortoise (Centrochelys sulcata) that had been housed with a conspecific was presented for tenesmus, diarrhea, and hematochezia of 48 hr duration. Husbandry was considered substandard. Hematology and plasma biochemical analysis revealed dehydration. Urinalysis was considered normal and fecal examination was negative for parasitic ova and protozoa. Radiography demonstrated moderate constipation. Initial treatment consisted of fluid therapy, enrofloxacin, metoclopramide, and improvement of husbandry practices. Recurrence of hematochezia developed 2 wk after initial presentation. Cloacoscopy followed by manual exteriorization of the penis revealed a puncture wound on the dorsal surface of the corpus cavernosum proximal to the glans penis. The wound was sutured using an absorbable monofilament material. The tortoise recovered uneventfully and was asymptomatic for the following 6 mo.

AB  - The sulcata or African spurred tortoise (Centrochelys sulcata) is a large tortoise species that is commonly kept in zoologic collections and as a pet. The objectives of this study were to establish reference intervals for selected biochemical analytes in clinically healthy captive sulcata tortoises and to evaluate the impact of blood sampling site and sex. Blood samples were collected from 60 tortoises from either the dorsal coccygeal (tail) vein or the subcarapacial venous plexus based on their body size. The packed cell volume and refractometric total solids (TS) were determined. The concentrations of selected plasma biochemical analytes were determined using the VetScan VS2 analyzer and included albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, bile acids, calcium, creatine kinase, globulins, glucose, potassium, sodium, phosphorous, total proteins (TP), and uric acid. The calcium-tophosphorous ratio was calculated. Reference intervals were determined and evaluated for the potential effects of blood sampling site and sex. There were significant differences (P < 0.05) associated with the blood sampling site in TS, TP, phosphorus, and globulins, with higher values in samples from the tail versus the subcarapacial sampling site. No significant statistical differences were noted in the plasma biochemistry analytes between the sexes. Reading of the globulins by the analyzer failed in 36 of 60 of the samples and was largely associated with the subcarapacial plexus sampling site. The reference intervals defined by the VetScan analyzer in this study can be used for clinical medicine and conservation of this tortoise species. Sampling site was identified as a factor significantly affecting some blood analytes in this study; this factor should thus be taken into consideration when assessing sulcata tortoise health status and using this testing methodology.

AB  - To better understand the habitat preferences of the African spurred tortoise (Centrochelys sukata), we tested possible associations between their distribution and land use, vegetation cover, the presence of roads, human settlements, and rainfall patterns, all of which affect the distributions of other tortoise species. African spurred tortoise distribution (based on 36 presence points compared with 250 random points) was strongly associated with 3 variables we analyzed: 1) Corine Land Cover (CLC) categories (especially sites with deciduous shrubs and high herbaceous cover relative to random bare areas), 2) distance from human settlements, and 3) distance from the nearest road.

AB  - In this paper, the results of the first density investigations (via Distance methodology on line transect surveys) for the threatened African spurred tortoise Centrochelys sulcata from West African Sahel (Niger and Burkina Faso) are reported. Spurred tortoises were encountered in 51.8% of Burkina Faso transects (n = 27) and in 60.7% of Niger transects. In several transects we found evidence of the tortoise presence, but without actually seeing any individual. Pooling all the transects from which tortoise density was calculated, the mean density of tortoises in Burkina Faso was 0.0021 ind./ha, and in Niger was 0.167 ind./ha. Nonetheless, there was a considerable variability in density estimates by transect in both countries, and especially in Tenere-Termit (Niger), the density of tortoises was very high (over 2 ind./ha). Tenere-Termit region in Niger may therefore represent a potentially crucial area for the conservation of this declining species.

AB  - Cystic calculi in reptiles are not very rare. But the case presented here is exceptional. An african spurred tortoise (G. sulcata) with a bodyweight of 1,200 g had a cystic calculus with a weight of 400 g. The clinical examination, radiology and laboratory results before intervention are described. The tortoise died seven days after surgery and thus enabled a post mortem examination. Mycotic pneumonia and tubulonephrosis were diagnosed. The discussion mentions the anatomical pecularities of the urogenital tract of tortoises and possible reasons for bladder stone formation.

AB  - The African Spurred Tortoise (Centrochelys sulcata), the second largest tortoise species in the world, is threatened with extinction because of a variety of threats, including habitat loss. Because details of habitat use for this species have not been published for wild populations of this species, we conducted this study to qualify and quantify habitat selection at two spatial scales in Burkina Faso and Niger (West Africa). Tortoises were active above-ground almost exclusively in August, during the peak of the wet season. We surveyed seven potential habitat types but the majority of adult and juvenile tortoises were observed in only two, dry river beds (locally named kori) and stabilized dunes. We used GIS (Geographical Information System) to map the known distribution of the African Spurred Tortoise in both countries in relation to the availability of kori. The habitat preference of African Spurred Tortoises widely overlaps with the occurrence of kori (and not permanent rivers or other water bodies) in the landscape. We discuss the biological and ecological reasons explaining the results, as well as the conservation consequences.

AB  - The African spurred tortoise (Centrochelys sulcata) is a threatened species, especially in West Africa, where it shows a scattered distribution. In Burkina Faso, the species distribution is unknown and we documented the current distribution and potential habitat characteristics. We found evidence of the species in a few sites in the northern and eastern part of the country, whereas some records from the southern part of Burkina Faso were considered unreliable. Multiple specimens were recorded only in four localities, mainly in the Sahel ecological zone. Annual rainfall was negatively related to the observed number of tortoises per site, and indeed these tortoises were found in the Sahel and adjacent ecoregions where rainfall is lower than other regions in Burkina Faso whereas latitude and numbers of tortoise individuals observed in each site were positively related. In a sample of 12 measured specimens, the males were significantly larger than females. Although the present surveys demonstrated that C. sulcatais present in Burkina Faso, we can not conclusively determine whether they are native or originated from escaped or introduced animals.

This species is threatened and declining consistently throughout its range, but little is known about the causes of its decline. It has been hypothesized that the decline is attributable to (1) competition with domestic cattle, (2) wildfire, and (3) the international pet trade. We conducted a series of analyses to investigate these three causes. Hypotheses. and. were analysed using a spatially explicit approach, using a database of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and logistic regression modelling; hypothesis. was tested by analysing the CITES trade database for 1990-2010. We found a significant negative correlation between intensity of grazing (expressed as density of cattle, km(-2)) and the presence of spurred tortoises, and this negative effect increased when coupled with high fire intensity, whereas wild-fires alone did not have a significant influence on the species' distribution at the global scale. There was a decrease in the annual export of wild individuals for the pet trade after the introduction of export quotas by country and by year, but trade data must be considered with caution.

AB  - We tested competing hypotheses regarding the persistence of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in the African spurred tortoise (Geochelone sulcata (Miller, 1779)), by measuring the effects of incubation temperature (T-inc) on a suite of physiological and behavioral endpoints, including resting metabolic rate, yolk-to-tissue conversion efficiency, posthatching growth, and temperature preference. Correlations of these variables with T-inc could lend support to the hypothesis that TSD persists owing to sex-specific benefits of development at specific temperatures, whereas absence of T-inc effects support the null hypothesis that TSD persists simply because selection favoring alternate sex determining mechanisms is weak or absent. The metabolic rate Q(10) value exhibited temporal variation and was higher immediately after hatching compared with 40 or 100 days posthatching, and mass conversion efficiency varied among clutches. Incubation temperature correlated inversely with duration of embryonic development, but did not influence yolk conversion efficiency, growth, or resting metabolic rate. Thus, our results provide little evidence indicating contemporary benefits of TSD, suggesting that TSD in G. sulcata is no longer evolutionarily adaptive but persists because selection against it and in favor of other sex-determining mechanisms is weak, or that TSD is an adaptive trait but for reasons not elucidated by this study.

AB  - It is widely assumed that future climatic conditions, alongside their effect on local environments, will result in either a change in how species use their habitats or in a shift in species distributions. The Sahel region of Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to experience drastic changes in its average aridity and overall climate in the coming decades. Herein we use Suitability Distribution Models (SDM) to model the potential range shift in the suitable habitat for Centrochelys sulcata, an IUCN listed Endangered tortoise species found in the arid Sahel, between current day and 2070 under projected climate change. Model predictions suggest an expansion of habitat with suitable climate conditions by 2070, albeit alongside an overall decrease in the predicted quality of available habitat within the newly projected range. Based on these predictions, we provide suggestions on priority con-servation areas critical for the long-term conservation of this species under the projected climate change scenario as well as call for improved sampling throughout the species current distribution.

AB  - Dermatophilosis has been described in many animals since it was first reported in 1915. In 2010, the genus and species associated with chelonid dermatophilosis was reclassified as Austwickia chelonae. Here we discuss a series of four submissions consisting of eight juvenile African spurred tortoises (Geochelone sulcata) from a large breeding facility. Submissions began in December 2016 and continued to June 2017 and then again in November 2018. Clinical signs were originally noted in December of 2015 and consisted of facial swelling and mandibular necrosis that led to complete disarticulation of the mandibles from the skull. Affected animals were emaciated with minimal gastrointestinal contents and several had soft faeces. The facial and head lesions were caused by A. chelonae. Additionally, co-infection with Cryptosporidium ducismarci was discovered within the small intestine. This report gives information on the pathology and pathogenicity of A. chelonae and characterizes the first reported cases of cryptosporidiosis in African spurred tortoises.

AB  - Intranuclear coccidiosis of tortoises (TINC) has been described in association with systemic disease in various species of tortoises. TINC has been detected in numerous tortoises from the United States, but there are only a few reports from tropical tortoises in Germany and no reports from Asia. Using a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, samples from 1,011 tortoises were screened for the presence of TINC. Samples originated from animals kept in captivity in Europe and in China. Coccidia were detected in a total of 27 chelonians (2.7%), including the first description of TINC in a marginated tortoise (Testudo marginata), Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni), African spurred tortoise (Centrochelys sulcata), and yellow-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis denticulatus). The highest percentage of positive animals was found in radiated tortoises (Astrochelys radiata). Although the percentage of positive animals was relatively low, this study demonstrates the global distribution of TINC in captive chelonians as well as expanding the known host range for these pathogens.

AB  - Carapacial suite pyramiding (CSP) is common in captive-raised turtles and tortoises. Several dietary and environmental hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, but few have been scientifically investigated. The effect of increased heat exposure on CSP and growth was examined in juvenile African leopard (Stigmochelys pardalis) and spurred (Centrochelys sulcata) tortoises. Monthly measurements of individual tortoise surface temperature, length, height, width, weight, and pyramid height of treatment (heat) and control (no heat) groups for 2 years were higher in the treatment groups. Allometric comparison further revealed increased pyramiding in the treatment group. Humidity and diet did not differ between treatment and control groups. The results of this research investigation indicate that growth rate and CSP appear to be directly related and both increase with excess nocturnal heat. The significance of the atypical carapace growth and subsequent consequences for naturally occurring tortoise populations, especially in the context of global climate change, is unknown but requires further investigation.

AB  - We analysed the population characteristics of African spurred tortoises (Centrochelys sulcata) kept in captivity in cities in Burkina Faso (West Africa), a country where the species occurs naturally. We focused on two cities - Ouagadougou, the capital and the largest city in the country and Fada N'Gourma in the East of the country. We identified 50 households in Ouagadougou and 14 in Fada that kept spurred tortoises in captivity.
   We recorded a total of 310 tortoises from which we took morphometric data of 281 individuals. Another 63 spurred tortoises were reported in other locations in Ouagadougou, but no access was allowed by the owners. Most tortoises in Ouagadougou were young, and had an equal sex ratio. In Fada, the majority of tortoises were adults and there was a practically even sex ratio. Population structure of the captive tortoises differed between cities, and about 30% of the Fada individuals were captured from the wild in the surroundings of the town. Body size of spurred tortoises in both cities differed between sexes: males were significantly heavier and had longer carapace and plastron than females. Body condition status was similar in Ouagadougou and Fada, with large adults being underweight compared to their optimal. The distribution of tortoise numbers according to city sector in both cities was clumped. Tortoise owners varied in their socioeconomic background. Most tortoises are fed an omnivorous diet, but some were given a strictly herbivorous regime. Our results suggest that there is a significant potential to engage tortoise owners to use their animals in a collaborative captive breeding programme to produce hatchlings for reintroduction.

AB  - The status of most vertebrates in the African Sahel is not well known. Among these, the African spurred tortoise (Centrochelys sulcata), a charismatic but also one of most threatened vertebrates in the Sahel, is still poorly studied. We investigated the status of this species, its potential distribution, habitat selection (at multiple spatial scales) and activity patterns in Mali and Burkina Faso, two countries within the tortoise' known range. We employed field surveys and villager interviews in 23 sites to determine the presence of the species. In these surveys and interviews, we also included the Western hinge-back tortoise (Kinixys nogueyi), a sympatric chelonian also suspected of being in decline. Age-stratified interviews revealed that C. sulcata is widespread in Mali, but since there was a statistically higher frequency of older respondents that remembered C. sulcata present around their village, compared to younger respondents, it is likely that the species has been declining throughout the study area. We encountered a total 77 C. sulcata and 20 K. nogueyi individuals during our field surveys. Most C. sulcata were found along areas of intermittent streams and stabilised dunes, known locally as koris. Centrochelys sulcata individuals were more likely to occur in sandy dry savannah areas that were further away from human settlements, and which contained inland waters or were closer to these. Kinixys nogueyi exhibited instead an allopatric distribution, with no ascertained sympatry with C. sulcata at the microhabitat scale. Cattle incidence was negatively correlated with the presence by C. sulcata. Our results also indicate that aboveground activity of C. sulcata is limited to the wet season and has a clearly bimodal diel activity cycle, with most sightings in the early morning hours. We provide suggestions on how best to survey this species in the wild while advancing new information on its distribution and biology. These data are invaluable to assess the status of this species as part of future conservation planning efforts.

AB  - Herein, we describe Alatochelon myrteum gen. et sp. nov., a large tortoise from the post-Messinian (lower Pliocene) of the area of Puerto de la Cadena (Region of Murcia), Spain. The new taxon cannot be attributed to Titanochelon, which represented the only lineage of large tortoises previously recognized in the Neogene record of Europe. Alatochelon myrteum shows African affinities, especially with the extant African spurred tortoise Centrochelys sulcata. Although close phylogenetic relationships have previously been recognized among some tortoises of both continents, the dispersal of this lineage had always been proposed as having occurred in only one direction: from Europe to Africa. The dispersal of the lineage including the new Spanish form and Centrochelys sulcata from Africa to Europe is proposed here. This proposal is compatible with those previously recognized for some lineages of mammals also found in Puerto de la Cadena, identified as African lineages that probably reached Europe during the Messinian Salinity Crisis event. An African origin is also proposed for the lineage of Titanochelon. Therefore, the two lineages of large derived testudinids (i.e. Geochelona) recognized in the European record experienced diachronic dispersal events from Africa to Europe: that to which Alatochelon belongs probably during the Messinian and the other much earlier, at the beginning of the Miocene or before.

AB  - Case description: An approximately 17-year-old male African spurred tortoise (Centrochelys sulcata) was presented to the small animal surgery service for loss of pelvic limb motor function of 1-month duration and a lack of response to medical management. Clinical findings: On physical examination, significant carapacial osteoderm pyramiding with a large depression at the level of the fourth vertebral scute was noted. Results of serial neurologic examination revealed nonambulatory paraparesis that progressed to superficial pain positive paraplegia and absent doacal tone. Both thoracic limbs were within normal limits on neurologic evaluation. A complete blood cell count and biochemistry profile revealed anemia, hyperuricemia, and monocytes containing intracellular bacteria. On computed tomography examination, stenosis and deviation of the spinal column was noted to be causing compression at the level of the fourth vertebral osteoderm. Treatment and outcome: A dorsal laminectomy was performed to relieve the spinal cord compression after removing a rectangular section of carapace. Immediately following surgery, the tortoise was noted to have significant cloacal tone. Unfortunately, the tortoise succumbed to suspected sepsis and toxemia within 48 hours of surgery. Clinical relevance: Carapacial pyramiding is commonly reported in captive tortoises. The changes noted in the carapace are attributed to inappropriate environmental conditions and diet. This case represents the first report of spinal canal and spinal cord stenosis in a tortoise secondary to carapacial pyramiding. The findings in this report suggest that dorsal laminectomy may be a viable treatment option in chelonians with spinal cord compression and neurologic deficits when indicated by clinical presentation.

AB  - The complete mitochondrial genome of Geochelone sulcata was determined using PCR, Long-PCR with length of 16,692 bp. The genome organization, gene order, and base composition was similar to typical vertebrate. Gene content included 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes, two rRNA genes, and one control region. Otherwise, the lack of C, as same as in the other species of Testudinidae, was detected in arms of tRNA(Lys) gene in G. sulcata. In addition, an extra nucleotide A was discovered in ND3 gene in G. sulcata. The complete mitogenome of G. sulcata provides the basic data to research molecular systematics of Testudinidae.

AB  - Urolithiasis is a disease often seen in tortoises at veterinary hospitals, however there have been no comprehensive research reports of tortoises with urolithiasis in Japan. In this study, we analyzed tortoises diagnosed with urolithiasis at three domestic veterinary hospitals. Based on medical records, we assessed the diagnostic method, species, sex, body weight, dietary history, husbandry, clinical signs, clinical examination, treatment for urolithiasis, and clinical outcome. The total number of cases in the 3 facilities was 101. As for species of tortoises, the most common was the African spurred tortoise (Centrochelys sulcata) with 42 cases (41.6%), followed by the Indian star tortoise (Geochelone elegans) with 30 cases (29.7%). Six other species were confirmed to have calculi. Almost all cases (99 cases, 98%) had a single calculus, and only 2 had multiple calculi. The prevalence of urolithiasis for the total number of tortoises having visited to one institution during the same period was 5.1%. Of the 86 cases that underwent calculi removal, 64 (74.4%) were successfully removed via the vent, and the efficacy of this method was confirmed. Nineteen cases (22%) were approached via plastronotomy, among which only 2 died postoperatively. In this study, we could not clarify the relationship between calculi formation and diets or other husbandry factors.

AB  - A 4.5-year-old, male African spur-thighed tortoise (Geochelone sulcata) was presented to the University of Florida Veterinary Teaching Hospital with a 2-week history of lethargy, anorexia, constipation, dyspnea, and coughing up fluid or vomiting. Laboratory results included an inflammatory leukogram and a marked increase in plasma uric acid concentration. Synovial fluid from multiple joints was thick, chalky white, and opaque, with a grainy consistency. Microscopically, the fluid contained numerous brown, needle-like crystals consistent with urates (gout). Gross necropsy findings and histopathology confirmed a diagnosis of systemic gout, with urate deposition, gout tophi, and underlying necrosis in multiple organs, including kidneys, lung, and liver. Dehydration with concurrent renal insufficiency may have impaired urate excretion and led to a build-up of urates in the blood and tissues of this tortoise. A high protein diet also may have contributed to the development of gout. Cytologic evaluation of synovial fluid can be used as a quick and definitive tool to diagnose gout in tortoises.

AB  - Three African spurred tortoises (Centrochelys sulcata) were referred for inappetence and lethargy of 1 week's duration. On presentation, one animal was confirmed dead and submitted for necropsy. The conspecifics were treated symptomatically for upper respiratory tract disease. The deceased individual tested negative for Herpes-, Rana- and Picornavirus but positive for Mycoplasma agassizii by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), however, without exhibiting pathological changes consistent with this infection. Instead, systemic mycosis was diagnosed, with isolation of Candida steatolytica. This allowed effective targeted treatment of the remaining animals. Candida steatolytica is commonly isolated from rotting fruits and has so far been rarely associated with clinical disease. In the present cases, the most likely source of infection was pruned vine shoots and leaves, which the tortoises had access to in their outdoor paddock. This case highlights the significance of rapid and comprehensive post-mortem diagnostics with swift interdisciplinary communication to allow effective handling of challenging cases.

KW  - PERICARDIAL-EFFUSION
KW  - ANATOMY
AB  - Cardiac lesions in tortoises are incompletely described in the literature. This retrospective case series includes 11 cases of degenerative cardiac disease in young tortoises from two species in human care: Gala ' pagos tortoise complex (Chelonoidis nigra complex) (n = 9) and sulcata tortoises (Centrochelys sulcata) (n = 2). Eight tortoises were male, two were female, and sex was undetermined for one individual. The age range at the time of death was 10-32 yr with a mean of 19 yr. The most common clinical signs noted prior to death were peripheral edema, lethargy, and inappetence. Common necropsy findings included generalized edema and pericardial effusion. All cases had ventricular myocardial fibrosis and several cases had epicardial adhesions. Additional common findings included hepatic lesions (hepatic lipidosis, hepatic fibrosis, and hepatitis) and pulmonary lesions (pulmonary edema, pulmonary fibrosis, and pneumocytic hypertrophy). A definitive cause for degenerative cardiac disease was not identified in this case series, but the young age distribution of the tortoises suggests that inappropriate environmental parameters, husbandry, and diet should be investigated as possible underlying contributing factors.

AB  - The African Spur tortoise, Geochelone sulcala, has been introduced to Costa Rica. A total of 3 1 tortoises were measured for 26 gross morphometry parameters. All individuals measured were inmature, aged from 5 to 34 months, and were born in captivity in La Garita de Alajuela, Costa Rica. Mean straight carapace length was 83.1 mm, mean straight plastron length was 68.3 mm and mean maximum height was 46.2 mm. All the measurements were correlated, except tail length and cloacal distance. Weight had the highest positive allometry coefficient. All the variables were joined in two Principal Components tail length and cloacal distance in Factor 2 and the rest of them in Factor 1. Lack of correlation among tail measures and the other variables as well as their inclusion in a different Factor could be related with an incipient development of sexual dimorphism characters.

AB  - Anesthesia is often required for the medical management of large tortoise species, but little has been published regarding effective anesthetic regimens for these species. The purpose of this study was to review anesthetic regimens that have been used safely and effectively in Galapagos (Chelonoidis nigra), Aldabra (Aldabrachelys gigantea), and African spurred (Centrochelys sulcata) tortoises, with the aim of improving medical management.
   Tortoises belong to the taxonomic family Testudinidae, which is considered one of the most imperiled families of the order Testudines. Anesthesia is often required for the medical and surgical management of large tortoises. The objectives of this retrospective study were to review drug regimens used to successfully anesthetize Galapagos (Chelonoidis nigra), Aldabra (Aldabrachelys gigantea) and African spurred (Centrochelys sulcata) tortoises, and to compare the times to effect and to extubation in tortoises administered different premedication protocols. Anesthetic records of giant tortoises admitted to the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine between January 2009 and December 2019 were reviewed. A total of 34 tortoises (six Aldabra, 23 Galapagos, and five African spurred) were included, resulting in 64 anesthetic events. Frequently used premedication protocols included an a(2)-adrenergic agonist and ketamine combined with either midazolam (group a(2)-adrenergic agonist, midazolam, ketamine, AMK; n = 34), a mu-opioid receptor agonist (group a(2)-adrenergic agonist, mu-opioid receptor agonist, ketamine, AOK; n = 13), or a mu-opioid receptor agonist and midazolam (group a(2)-adrenergic agonist, midazolam, mu-opioid receptor agonist, ketamine, AMOK; n = 10). Inhalant anesthetics (isoflurane, n = 21; sevoflurane, n = 23) were frequently used for maintenance of anesthesia following premedication. Out of the 34 total tortoises, 22 had only one anesthetic event, five had two anesthetic events, three had three anesthetic events, and four had four or more anesthetic events. Few adverse effects were observed and there was no mortality reported during the peri-anesthetic period. Sedation and general anesthesia of giant tortoises can be successfully performed with a combination of an a(2)-adrenergic agonist and ketamine in combination with midazolam and/or a mu-opioid receptor agonist.

AB  - Quantity discrimination, is thought to be highly adaptive as it allows an organism to select greater amounts of food or larger social groups. In contrast to mammals, the processes underlying this ability are not as well understood in reptiles. This study examined the effects of ratio and number size on relative quantity discrimination in African spurred tortoises (Centrochelys sulcata). To assess these effects, tortoises were presented with trays containing favored food pieces in all possible number combinations between 1 and 7. The tortoises had to approach the tray they perceived as having the larger quantity. If correct, they received one piece of food as reinforcement. The results revealed that relative quantity discrimination was influenced by the ratio between the numbers of pieces, with performance improving as the ratio between the numbers increased. This finding suggests that the approximate number system or analogue magnitude estimation may control their behavior. However, as the number size increased, their performance declined, also suggesting that the approximate number system alone could not explain the present results.

AB  - In captivity, tortoises often grow faster than their conspecifics in the wild. Here, we document growth (measured as change in body mass) in three individual Geochelone sulcata over an exceptionally long period of nearly 18 years and use growth data (measured as change in carapace length) from the literature on free-ranging animals for comparison. Body lengths almost reached a plateau in the animals due to the long observation period. After transformation of body length to body mass for data from wild animals, logistic growth curves were successfully fitted to all data. The resulting functions yielded a 1.4-2.6 times higher intrinsic growth rate in captive than in wild individuals. The logistic growth model estimated the inflexion point of the growth curve at 6-9 years for the captive animals. This coincided with age at sexual maturity, respectively observations of first egg-laying of a female and the masturbation of a male. The inflexion point of the growth curve for free-ranging individuals was estimated at 15 years. Raising tortoises on intensive feeding regimes in captivity may considerably shorten generation times during the breeding stage of restocking programmes, and slow-growing animals are more likely to thrive after release into the wild. Investigations on the health of offspring from fast-growing parents are lacking.

KW  - CYSTIC CALCULUS
AB  - Case Description-3 female African spurred tortoises (Geochelone sulcata) of various body weights (0.22, 0.77, and 2.86 kg [0.48, 1.69, and 6.29 lb]) were examined because of reduced food intake and lack of fecal output. Owners reported intermittent tenesmus in 2 of the tortoises.
   Clinical Findings-Physical examinations revealed no clinically important abnormalities in the tortoises. Cloacal calculi were diagnosed on the basis of radiography and cloacoscopy in all 3 tortoises. One tortoise had another calculus in the urinary bladder.
   Treatment and Outcome-Tortoises were anesthetized, and cloacal calculi were removed by use of a cutting burr (plain-fissure cutting burr and a soft tissue protector mounted to a dental handpiece that had a low-speed motor and a straight nose cone) and warm water irrigation with endoscopic guidance. Complete removal of calculus fragments was achieved by use of forceps and irrigation. In 1 tortoise, removal of the cloacal calculus was staged 12 separate procedures). In another tortoise, a second cloacal calculus (which had been located in the urinary bladder during the first examination) was successfully removed 25 days after removal of the first calculus. All 3 tortoises recovered uneventfully, and serious complications secondary to removal of the cloacal calculi were not detected.
   Clinical Relevance-Cloacoscopy combined with the use of a low-speed dental drill and warm water irrigation should be considered a simple, safe, and nontraumatic treatment option for removal of obstructive cloacal calculi in tortoises. (J Am Vet Med Assoc 2012;240:869-875)

AB  - This study determined the views of respondents in Akwuke and Iva mine communities concerning the impact of coal mining activities on animal and plant species, pattern of settlement, pollution effect and health of people living in these two mined areas in Enugu, Nigeria. Data were generated through sample survey using a well-structured questionnaire and personal observation in the field. Khaya ivorensis (mahogany) was the major tree species that had gone extinct (72% of respondents), and Geochelone sulcata (tortoise) was the major animal species that has gone extinct (80% of respondents) in the two mined areas. Sixty-five percent of the respondents said that water pollution was most severe environmental impact of mining in Akwuke. The major health hazard caused by mining in Akwuke (55% of respondents) and Iva (65% of respondents) was blindness. Indeed, 82.5% of respondents indicated that mining affected the pattern of settlement in the two mined areas. Emphatically, coal mining affected negatively some of the socio-economic activities of the inhabitants of the mined area through removal of vegetation to access coal deposit vis-a-vis blasting, quarrying and crushing of coal.

AB  - Intranuclear coccidiosis of itestudines (known as TINC) is an emerging disease in chelonians. Although endogenous stages were repeatedly detected in various tissues, attempts to find the oocysts in faeces failed, leaving the question of the transmission and classification of the causative agent of TINC unresolved. We recorded small spherical oocysts (similar to 6-7 mu m in diameter) of an eimeriid coccidium in faeces of a leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis). Sporulated oocysts were used for the experimental oral inoculation of juvenile coccidia-free tortoises representing 5 species (S. pardalis, Testudo graeca, T. hermanni, T. horsfieldii, and Geochelone sulcata). The oocysts' association with TINC was confirmed based on clinical signs, histopathological findings of intranuclear endogenous stages of the coccidium in many organs (including intestine), and by the partial 18S rDNA sequence analysis of the DNA isolated from organs of the experimentally infected animals and from a single naturally infected as well as from all experimentally infected tortoises. Breeding colonies of chelonians should be screened for this pathogen in order to prevent its further spread and unwanted introduction into endangered free-ranging chelonian populations.

AB  - Defining priorities is important both in research and in conservation, especially when knowledge gaps are hindering successful management. In this review, we quantify the knowledge gaps for all non-marine West African chelonians based on 21 criteria. Additionally, we combine these knowledge gaps with each species' maximum size, range size, presence in nationally protected areas, and IUCN Red List or TFTSG provisional status to introduce a ranking of species conservation priority in the region. Our analyses revealed a divergence between which species are lacking research studies and which would benefit most from conservation actions, though Cyclanorbis elegans is the species that is both the least-known and most-in -need of conservation. Broadly, Pelomedusidae are in the greatest need of research, yet they are also collectively the least threatened. Conversely, Trionychidae and Testudinidae have received greater research attention in most cases, however, these two families represent the greatest conservation priorities amongst West African chelonians. Our analyses also enabled us to evaluate which criteria representing aspects of chelonian biology have been most overlooked by the scientific community. Priorities for future research include reproductive and long-term population studies, each of which are critical for informing conservation actions and evaluating the results of those actions.

TI  - Influence of environmental humidity and dietary protein on pyramidal growth of carapaces in African spurred tortoises (Geochelone sulcata)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY AND ANIMAL NUTRITION
LA  - English
AB  - The carapaces of captive-raised tortoises (terrestrial chelonians of the zoological family Testudinidae, often develop pyramidal-shaped osseous growth centrally within the horny plates. With very few exceptions (e.g. Geochelone elegans , Psammobates sp.), this conical growth pattern is considered to be pathologic. This very common defect is believed to be an important indicator of the quality of captive tortoise management. This study was designed to examine the effect of dietary protein level and environmental humidity on the degree of pyramidal growth in the carapaces. Fifty recently hatched African spurred tortoises (G. sulcata ) were raised for 5 months under artificial conditions of varying environmental humidity and dietary protein content (14% vs. 19% vs. 30% crude protein in dry matter). Humps of the carapaces that developed and blood values of calcium, phosphorus and haematocrit were measured and compared among groups. Dry environmental conditions (24.3-57.8% and 30.6-74.8% relative humidity) produced taller humps than humid conditions (45-99% relative humidity). Hump formation differed significantly (pless than or equal to0.001) between these three groups kept under different humidity conditions. Variable dietary protein had a minor, positive impact on this pathological formation of humps (pyramidal growth syndrome, PGS). Analysis of blood (calcium, phosphorus and haematocrit) offered no further explanation as to the development of the humps.

AB  - Heartwater is a tick-borne infectious disease caused by the rickettsial organism Cowdria ruminantium, currently Ehrlichia ruminantium. It poses an imminent threat to the Western Hemisphere, where it could cause mortality in cattle and other ruminant livestock in excess of 70%. It has been reported in the Caribbean; and its vector, Amblyomma sparsum, has been found on imported African spurred tortoises (Geochelone sulcata) and leopard tortoises (Geochelone pardalis) in southern Florida in the United States, leading to an importation ban on these reptiles. Symptoms have not been previously reported in reptiles. Here, we report peracute and acute deaths in African vipers imported from Africa through Florida. Signs included vomiting mucoid fluid, diarrhea, emaciation, convulsions, and death. Postmortem showed few gross lesions. The most consistent peracute and acute lesions were the pulmonary lesions and pericarditis with considerable bloody fluid in the pericardial sac (hydropericardium). These lesions strongly resembled the lesions of heartwater and a coccobacillus of less than 1-micron diameter was isolated in viper cell culture. The outbreak was brought to a halt by tick control and treatment of all exposed snakes with tetracycline. This isolation, tetracycline sensitivity, clinical signs, preliminary results with polymerase chain reaction of pCS20 ORF, and the viper preference of the disease may indicate a Cowdria-related attenuated species that has adapted to infect reptiles or an emerging new form of this group of microbes.

AB  - Perivitelline membrane (PVM)-bound sperm detection has recently been incorporated into avian breeding programs to assess egg fertility, confirm successful copulation, and to evaluate male reproductive status and pair compatibility. Due to the similarities between avian and chelonian egg structure and development, and because fertility determination in chelonian eggs lacking embryonic growth is equally challenging, PVM-bound sperm detection may also be a promising tool for the reproductive management of turtles and tortoises. This study is the first to successfully demonstrate the use of PVM-bound sperm detection in chelonian eggs. Recovered membranes were stained with Hoechst 33342 and examined for sperm presence using fluorescence microscopy. Sperm were positively identified for up to 206 days post-oviposition, following storage, diapause, and/or incubation, in 52 opportunistically collected eggs representing 12 species. However, advanced microbial infection frequently hindered the ability to detect membrane-bound sperm. Fertile Centrochelys sulcata, Manouria emys, and Stigmochelys pardalis eggs were used to evaluate the impact of incubation and storage on the ability to detect sperm. Storage at -20 degrees C or in formalin were found to be the best methods for egg preservation prior to sperm detection. Additionally, sperm-derived mtDNA was isolated and PCR amplified from Astrochelys radiata, C. sulcata, and S. pardalis eggs. PVM-bound sperm detection has the potential to substantially improve studies of artificial incubation and sperm storage, and could be used to evaluate the success of artificial insemination in chelonian species. Mitochondrial DNA from PVM-bound sperm has applications for parentage analysis, the study of sperm competition, and potentially species identification. Zoo Biol. 35:95-103, 2016.

AB  - Objective: Tortoise picornavirus (ToPV) has been speculated to play an important role in the frequently seen disease pattern of juvenile shell softening. This study aimed to determine ToPV prevalence among German tortoise collections. Material and methods: A total of 334 animals selected from 27 different collections were included. Seven species of four genera of the family Testudinidae (Testudo graeca, T. hermanni, T. marginata, T. horsfieldii, Centrochelys sulcata, Stigmochelys pardalis, Chelonoidis carbonarius) were sampled. The tortoises were clinically investigated and none of the adults showed any signs of shell softening. Seven hatchlings of a ToPV-positive T. graeca breeding pair showed retarded growth and a progressive shell weakness that resulted in death. Each animal was sampled by conjunctival, pharyngeal and cloacal swabs (990 swabs in total) and blood sampling (293 in total). All three swabs of one animal were pooled and tested by reverse transcriptase polymerise chain reaction (RT-PCR) for tortoise picornavirus RNA. Blood samples were investigated by virus neutralisation test (VNT) for specific anti ToPV antibodies. All titres equal to or higher than log(2) = 2 were considered positive. Results: In total, 35 adult and 11 juvenile animals were tested positive for ToPV RNA. The serological investigation did detect specific antibodies against ToPV in 44 adult tortoises and one juvenile. In total, 76 animals were tested positive in either one of the investigations, 16 animals in both. The highest number of ToPV-positive animals was found for T. graeca, with a prevalence of 32 %. No specimens of C. carbonarius, C. sulcata, or S. pardalis were tested positive. Conclusion and clinical relevance: The results propose a predisposition in T graeca, as well as a high prevalence of ToPV in T. graeca, whereas other species showed only single or no positive animals, but may function as virus carriers.

AB  - Geochelone pardalis (Bell 1828) shows wide variation of body size in Africa, with tortoises in the north (Republic of Somaliland) being of comparable size to insular giant tortoises. Growth data on G. pardalis, the continental giant species G. sulcata (Miller 1779) and the Aldabran giant tortoise G. gigantea (Schweigger 1812) were re-analysed using Ford-Walford plots, and their growth patterns compared. All species and populations fitted a two-phase growth curve, with initial asymptotic growth followed by slow indeterminate linear growth. Asymptotic growth was non-Bertalanffy in all groups, with most individuals fitting Gompertz or logistic-by-mass models best. Juvenile growth (for ages 3-8) was also approximately linear in all groups. Variation between populations and species was in the rate of juvenile growth, asymptotic size reached, rate of subsequent linear growth, and survival rate of older individuals. Geochelone pardalis from Somaliland had similar juvenile growth rates and asymptotic sizes to other populations, and their large mean size was due to high survival and continued linear growth after the asymptote. Geochelone sulcata had similar juvenile growth rates to G. pardalis, but reached larger asymptotic sizes; indeterminate linear growth was similar to that of G. pardalis. Geochelone gigantea had much higher juvenile growth rates than the continental species, reflecting a longer activity season. Asymptotic size and the rate of indeterminate linear growth were lower in a high-density (Grande Terre) than low-density (Ile Malabar) population of G. gigantea. The growth rate of juveniles was not affected by population density, so that the Grande Terre population had higher growth rates of juveniles relative to larger tortoises and was the only group to approach Bertalanffy-type growth, as predicted.

AB  - The illegal and unsustainable trade in tortoises and freshwater turtles in Asia is a clear impediment to their conservation, leading to steep population declines and what has become known as the Asian Turtle Crisis. We focus on the trade in tortoises and freshwater turtles for pets in one of Southeast Asia's largest wildlife trading centres, the Chatuchak Market in Bangkok, Thailand. Between November 2004 and December 2013 we surveyed Chatuchak 12 times, recording all species and quantities of tortoises and freshwater turtles openly for sale. In total, 2,667 individuals representing 55 species, were observed with 97 % of the individuals belonging to species not native to Thailand. African, South Asian and Southeast Asian species made up the largest numbers. The number of individuals recorded per survey ranged between 110 and 522 of between 11 and 24 species; species richness, species diversity and evenness did not show any clear temporal pattern. New species were added after new surveys suggesting a continual increasing supply of novel species. The most common species in trade over this period were Indian star tortoise Geochelone elegans (653 individuals), African spurred tortoise G. sulcata (536) and radiated tortoise Astrochelys radiata (320). Globally threatened species were observed during every survey, totalling 1,235 individuals of 20 species. These included Critically Endangered radiated tortoises and Burmese star tortoise G. platynota. Non-native CITES I listed species, i.e. species that should not be traded internationally, such as black spotted turtle Geoclemys hamiltonii from northeastern India and Bangladesh, were observed during all but one surveys, totalling 417 individuals of seven species. The observations of large numbers of species that had clearly entered the country illegally was clear evidence that unscrupulous traders are taking advantage of the loopholes in Thailand's legislation. Legal reform in Thailand is urgently required, so that the Wild Animal Reservation and Protection Act can function as an effective piece of legislation to be used to bring an end to the illegal trade in tortoises and freshwater turtles in Thailand.

AB  - The chelonian fauna of West Africa is relatively understudied and experiencing a multitude of threats. Moreover, the IUCN Red List status of several African species is both outdated and, we believe, underestimated. Herein, we cover projections for freshwater turtle and tortoise status trends in West Africa over the next decade. This geographic prioritization was chosen based on our current understanding of the greatest urgency for turtle conservation in Africa. Broadly, we recommend that priority projects focus on the following threats: bushmeat consumption (Trionychidae and Kinixys spp.); habitat degradation and potential shifts in habitat use (primarily Kinixys spp. in the rainforest belt of West Africa); effects of livestock overgrazing and climate change (specifically in regards to desertification impacting the Sahel region) on behaviors and species sex ratios (Centrochelys sulcata, Kinixys belliana and K. nogueyi). Possible efforts to mitigate these threats include; (1) enhanced capacity building, outreach, and training to promote turtle conservation to wildlife professionals, fisheries stakeholders, local communities, etc; (2) alternative livelihoods and sources of protein (provide locals with goats, sustainable farming options, aquaculture practices); (3) community engagement and citizen science; (4) connecting fragmented habitats (e.g. corridors); (5) enhancing community protected areas with local enforcement (local employment and benefits, eco-tourism potential); (6) youth and consumer/collector targeted education programs; and (7) reinforcement of international policy (CITES) for species negatively affected by the pet trade (K. homeana and K. erosa). Based on witnessed range-wide declines and exploitation, on a species level we suggest priority attention be aimed at A) Cyclanorbis elegans (assessment of population strongholds, if any, threats, and mitigation options) and B) Kinixys homeana and K. erosa (use in the illegal bushmeat trade, long-term population trends). Field studies on several under-studied Pelusios species (e.g., P. cupulatta, P. adansonii) are also warranted, along with increased sampling of the severely declined and elusive Trionyx triunguis in West Africa. Finally, we believe turtle and tortoise conservation in Africa would greatly benefit from collaboration and integration of research efforts with programs and scientists in Eastern and Southern Africa, for instance via a novel IUCN/SSC TFTSG continental symposium focused on red list status assessments/reassessments.
